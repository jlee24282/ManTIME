It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stearns","zipCode":"56302","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Saint Cloud","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"St. Cloud Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660629","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"916"},"name":"St. Cloud Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sctimes.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695197826095","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

She died in the same home on the Kansas prairie where she grew up and lived most of her married life.\n\nFood was Mom's favorite language. She loved spending time cooking and baking for others, skills that were honed after marrying into John Koehn's family on July 14, 1974. After learning how to make traditional Mennonite dishes, the student became the master. Now that John's mother has passed away, we can safely say that Mom's zwieback and New Year's cookies were better than her mother-in-law's. Sorry, Grandma.\n\nMom was terrified of mice, a fear cemented by her son, who chased her around with one when he was very young (though old enough to know better). Locking herself in the bathroom was no escape, as he simply pushed the mouse under the door. Mom had little fear of anything else and would kindly remove egg-eating bull snakes from the hens' nests and relocate them to friendlier environs to protect their cholesterol levels. She was only once scared by a snake, when a rattler struck (unsuccessfully) at her face. She had stopped while mowing to pick up and move what she assumed was a bull snake, only to discover it wasn't. When asked what she had done when the rattlesnake struck, she admitted, \"I peed just a little.\"\n\nMom had an adventurous spirit, affection for any animal, a nurturing heart and loved family above all. These traits were good ones for her to possess, as several relatives (by blood and marriage) are, frankly, a bit questionable. These traits also served her well as an elementary school librarian, a job she loved more than anyone has a right to love a job. Of all the children she nurtured and adored, however, only two boys, Kelton and Caleb, are lucky enough to call her Nana. Mom was one of those rare people who are satisfied with their lot. She had a strong faith, loved her family deeply, found blessings and humor in even the smallest things, had many close friends, and cultivated beauty all around her through her flower and vegetable gardens. She had what she wanted, and wanted what she had. She radiated true joy.\n\nTrue to her nature, Mom spent her final days thanking others. Her family, including husband, John; son, Andrew (Leah); grandsons, Kelton and Caleb; daughter, Sarah (Eric); father, Joe (Helen); sisters, Connie (Gregory) and Gloria (Stan); and brother, Van (Stacy); extended family; and many, many friends who will miss her immensely. The only silver lining is that we all may lose a little weight. We all will strive to be as good as Mom always believed we were.\n\nServices will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 4, at Dighton's United Methodist Church. In lieu of flowers, or in addition to, as Mom did so love flowers, she would hope you would do some unexpected and unsolicited act of kindness for someone else in her name. Memorials should be sent to Boomhower Funeral Home, PO Box 891, Dighton, KS 67839. Mom's wishes were that memorials be designated for Mennonite Central Committee or Heifer International, so she could continue to help others, even after her death.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Obituaries","group":"Society"}],"title":"Jill Jeanette (Hanks) Koehn","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Reno","zipCode":"67501","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Hutchinson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hutchinson News","feed":{"genre":"Obituaries","tags":[],"id":"169673952","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1546"},"name":"Hutchinson News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hutchnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197830083","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/hutchnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/e2/ce269520-4afe-5524-aed1-093d97ef12eb/588d2fd061ca0.image.jpg?resize=300%2C306"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/hutchnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/e2/ce269520-4afe-5524-aed1-093d97ef12eb/588d2fd061ca0.image.jpg?resize=319%2C325"}],"video":[]}}

After the tornado the family moved to Minneola, where H.A. grew up and graduated from high school in 1955. H.A. was an athletic man who enjoyed playing football, track, and basketball. He attended college on a football scholarship in Ottawa for one year and then attended the Community College of Dodge City.\n\nH.A. met Kathleen (Copeland) in their senior year of high school on a blind date and they quickly fell in love and were married Aug. 29, 1955 at the Community Church in Minneola. They moved to Dodge City, where they settled down and started their family of three children which he adored, David (1957), Doug (1959), and Teresa (1967). Also during this time his love for cars became a passion for racing. He especially loved racing his super modified cars and held the track record for 20 plus years. H.A.'s ability of working with his hands led him into the construction industry where he strapped on his tool belt, his trademark bandana and started his own general contracting business in Dodge City. A new opportunity presented itself in 1977 for H.A. and Kathy to purchase Vermillion's Building Center in Limon, Colorado. In addition to the lumberyard, H.A. assembled his crew and began mentoring and building his own construction company in Limon. H.A.'s passions included a love of sports, racing, hunting and fishing. He was also active in his community church and youth groups. H.A. is described by many as a man who loved the Lord, had a passion for his trade, and a zest for life. He loved his family and absolutely adored his grandchildren and great grandchildren. His charismatic personality, tool belt, bandana, encouraging words, and kind heart will be greatly missed by many.\n\nH.A. was preceded in death by his parents, Eli and Esther Ratzlaff; brother-in-law, Tom Randle; and niece, Vickie Harris. He is survived by wife, Kathy of Limon, Colo.; sons, David Ratzlaff of Pierce City, Mo., and Doug (JoAnn) of Limon, Colo.; daughter, Teresa Becker (Richard) of Hugo, Colo.; sisters, Arlene Randle of Dodge City, Vivian Luce of Great Bend, and Katherine McCalla (Jerry) of Emporia; brother, Don Ratzlaff (Harriet) of Olathe; grandchildren, Jennifer Nestor (Zane) of Limon, Colo., Jason Ratzlaff of Wichita, Melinda Holforty (Travis) of Windsor, Colo., Mandy Ratzlaff of Wichita, Justin Ratzlaff of Hugo, Colo.; and great-grandchildren, Emilee and Landon Nestor of Limon, Colo., Emma and Logan Holforty of Windsor, Colo., Jude Ratzlaff of Wichita; as well as many other nieces, nephews, family and friends that he loved dearly.\n\nVisitation and Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, Jan. 25, and Thursday, Jan. 26, at Love Funeral Home in Limon, Colorado.

(Photo: Justin Lane, EPA) \n  \nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hundreds of outraged demonstrators converged on San Francisco International Airport Saturday afternoon, in defiance of President Trump's executive order banning refugees and foreign citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries entry into the U.S. \n \nWaving signs reading \u201cMy Grandparents Were One of the Lucky Ones\" and \"One Earth, One People, One Love,\u201d they chanted in full throat, \"You put a wall, we tear it down\" and \"Never again!\" \n \nAs the crowd swelled to as many as 1,000, some protesters spilled onto the road that circled the international terminal, briefly blocking access for cars attempting to get to the terminal. Organizers extended the peaceful protest. \n \nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin, an immigrant himself, and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom were among the protesters. \n \nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee issued a statement, calling the ban \"disgusting.\" \n \n\"As the son of Chinese immigrants, I am disgusted by the President\u2019s Executive Order to target the Muslim community and ban immigrants from entering the United States,\" the mayor said. \n \nThe crowd only began to thin after a federal court in Brooklyn issued a temporary emergency stay halting Trump's order late Saturday. But it remained large, and boisterous, deep into the night. \n \n\"It was chaos,\" Buzz Frahn, an immigration attorney from Palo Alto, Calif., said of the demonstration. \n \nFrahn was one of dozens of lawyers who rushed to the airport to assist families waiting for members to clear customs. He said he was aware of at least five travelers detained who are Iranian. \n \n\u201cMy parents came from Iran right before I was born,\u201d protester Samin Nosrat, 37, of Berkeley told the San Francisco Chronicle . \u201cI am the child of refugees. If they were not allowed to come here, I do not know what my life would look like ... this is unacceptable.\u201d \n \nAt JFK International Airport, a Stanford University graduate student, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., was detained for several hours and handcuffed briefly after returning from a research trip to Sudan, according to an email issued by the university on the immigration ban obtained by USA TODAY. \n \nThe San Francisco Bay Area isn't just a bastion of liberal politics, but also the home of Silicon Valley, which is dependent on a pipeline of technical talent from overseas. \n \nIn a staff memo, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the ban affects nearly 200 of the company's staff. \n \nChief executives of Apple, Microsoft, Uber and Netflix denounced the policy, which would compromise their employees working legally here and create barriers from them bringing talent to the U.S. \n \nWhile the ban applied to refugees, human rights groups have reported that green card holders \u2014 legal permanent residents of the United States who have the right to live and work here \u2014 have also been stopped. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nTrump immigration ban sends shockwaves through tech \n  \n\"The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting,\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet. \"We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S.\" \n \nThen there is the historical perspective, attorney Frahn said. \n \n\"One sign really stood out,\" he said. \"It said Anne Frank and her family were denied entry as refugees to the U.S. in 1941.

Smith, AFP/) \n  \nPresident Trump\u2019s ban on immigration by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries ran into at least a temporary roadblock Saturday night, after a U.S. District judge in Brooklyn granted an emergency stay sought by immigrants\u2019 rights lawyers. \n \nThe judge\u2019s ruling applies to those who have already arrived in the U.S. and those who are in transit who hold valid visas. The decision halts part of Trump\u2019s executive order, which barred citizens from those seven countries for the next 90 days. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said that by Saturday evening, its agents had stopped 109 foreigners at U.S. airports based on Trump\u2019s order and prevented another 173 people from boarding flights headed for the U.S. \n \nAfter U.S. District Court Ann Donnelly granted the stay, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which had filed suit to block Trump\u2019s ban, issued a one-word celebratory tweet: \u201cVictory!!!!!!\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed Friday, suspends the entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halts admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for three months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nMore coverage:  \n \nProtests erupt: The scene at JFK \n \nTrump says immigration ban working 'nicely\u2019 as protests, detainments hit airports \n \nHow the world responded:  Iran retaliates, Canada opens arms after Trump immigration ban \n \nU.S. immigrants: 'Our president is trying to divide us' \n \nGoogle CEO, tech leaders weighs in on how move affects their employees  \n \nHow ban is affecting travel \n \nPeople flood social media with tales of stranded family, friends \n \nTrump says he's 'hit the ground running at a record pace' \n \nA Syrian and his American wife are stuck in Iraq because of Trump's ban \n \nA senior Homeland Security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide an operational update on Trump\u2019s executive order, said the department quickly overhauled its screening procedures after Trump signed the order Friday. The department issued new guidance to its Customs and Border Protection officers in the field and adjusted its computerized targeting system to identify people who are barred entry through the executive order. \n \nThe official said the order allowed legal permanent residents \u2014 known as green-card holders \u2014 and foreigners who were granted special visas for Iraqi and Afghan interpreters, to enter after undergoing a full background check and in-person interview. The official said 81 people made it through that process and were allowed to enter the country. The official said Homeland Security\u2019s legal team was reviewing the New York federal judge's Saturday ruling and that the department would adjust its practices in line with the order. \n \nIn Virginia, another federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Saturday night, directing the Department of Homeland Security to allow lawyers to meet with legal permanent residents detained at Washington Dulles International Airport. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema also forbade Homeland Security from deporting any of the green-card holders for seven days. \n \n\u201cPresident Trump never gave a second thought to how his discriminatory, un-American order would actually play out on the ground,\u201d Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said after the judge's ruling. \u201cWe will continue to explore any legal options available to the Commonwealth to oppose this misguided effort.\u201d \n \nKaren Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, which was part of the suit in New York, said the lawyers were \u201ctremendously relieved\u201d by the judge\u2019s stay. But she said the legal team was quickly moving to free the immigrants who remained in U.S Customs and Border Protection custody Saturday night based on Trump\u2019s executive order. \n \nShe challenged the DHS numbers, calling them \"alternative facts.\" \n \n\"We have 50 Iranian green-card holders being held from one single flight at (Los Angeles International Airport),\" Tumlin said. \"It doesn't add up.\" \n \nThe fallout from the president's temporary ban struck with full force earlier Saturday, blocking some travelers from boarding their planes overseas, compelling others to turn around upon arrival in the U.S., and prompting customs agents at New York's JFK Airport to detain at least a dozen people, including a former Iraqi translator for the U.S. military in Baghdad. \n \nThe growing chaos also sparked legal challenges, airport protests, condemnations from politicians and denunciations from advocacy groups. \n \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Saturday tweeted an offer of support to those who had been stopped at the state's airports: \"I have directed Port Authority, @NYSDOS, & my Counsel's Office to jointly explore all legal options to assist anyone detained at NY airports.\" \n   \nI have directed Port Authority, @NYSDOS , & my Counsel's Office to jointly explore all legal options to assist anyone detained at NY airports pic.twitter.com/AT8p3rstsD \n\u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 28, 2017   \nCuomo's tweet linked to a statement in which he objected to refugees being blocked from entering the U.S. \n \n\"I never thought I'd see the day when refugees, who have fled war-torn countries in search of a better life, would be turned away from our doorstep. We are a nation of bridges, not walls, and a great many of us still believe in the words 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses \u2026' \" he wrote. \"This is not who we are, not who we should be.\" \n     CLOSE      \nSara Flounders from Jersey City at the Union Square subway station en route to JFK protests. Rick Green/NorthJersey.com \n    \nThe reverberations began only hours after Trump signed the executive order Friday. In brief remarks while signing his latest executive orders Saturday, Trump maintained the order isn't a \"Muslim ban.\" \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. We\u2019re going to have a strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years,\" he said. \n \nThe ban includes green card holders, who will need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States, a senior administration official said in a White House briefing Saturday. Green card holders already in the U.S. will need to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, according to the official, who declined to be identified under the rules of the briefing. \n \nSpeaking to hundreds of demonstrators at JFK Airport, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called the ban ineffective, discriminatory, \"disgusting,\" and said it \"goes against every ounce of our traditions from George Washington onward.\" \n \n\"We are here to say it should be stopped and be revoked,\" he said. \n \nAbout 50 people were detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said Alia Salem, executive director for DFW Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Families have been waiting at Terminal D in anticipation of meeting relatives who been held up in U.S Customs. A representative with CAIR met with families waiting for relatives. Some of them have been waiting for several hours. \n \nAt Philadelphia International Airport, two Syrian families, described as Christians, were briefly detained Saturday after arriving from Qatar and sent back three hours later. The families included two brothers, their wives and two children, according to a family member form Allentown, Pa.,  NBC10 reported . \"This is like a nightmare come true,\" said Joseph Assali, who noted that the families had visas and green cards legally obtained months ago. \n \nMohammed Al Rawi, chief information officer for Los Angeles County, said on Facebook that his father was removed from a flight in Qatar as a direct result of the order. \"My 71-year-old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas,\" he wrote. \n \nForeigners studying at U.S. universities who were part of study-abroad programs were also stuck. Even Customs and Border Protection agents were confused about how to handle Trump\u2019s order and responding in different ways, he said. \n \nThose holding dual nationality in the seven nations involved in the ban will also be barred from entering the United States, the  Wall Street Journal  reported citing a statement from the State Department that has yet to be released. \n   \nPleased to announce w/ @NydiaVelazquez the release of Hameed Jhalid Darweesh from detention at JFK. pic.twitter.com/AeKDhIPp7k \n\u2014 (((Rep.

After being released Saturday afternoon, Darweesh said he had feared he would be sent back to Iraq, which his family fled because of death threats. \n \nWhen asked by reporters outside the airport what he thought of Trump, Darweesh said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

America is the land of freedom.\u201d \n \nHaider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who was trying to join his wife and child and detained along with Darweesh, was released hours later Saturday. His wife worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq as an accountant, was granted a refugee visa and is now living in Houston. Alshawi was approved for a visa to join his wife and their 7-year-old son on Jan. 11. \n \nAccording to a  federal complaint  filed on behalf of two Iraqis being held at JFK airport, one attorney approached Customs and Border Patrol agents with a request to speak to his client, but was told they were not the ones to talk to about seeing him. \n \n\"Who is the person to talk to?\" the lawyer asked, according to the complaint.

It is a cessation of most travel with case-by-case exceptions.\u201d \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nTrump's executive order suspends the entry of Syrian refugees into U.S. \n  \nAbed Ayoud, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said the group received more than 1,000 calls by midday Saturday from people who have been stranded or detained in the U.S. and abroad. \n \nHe said legal immigrants traveling overseas to attend funerals and visit family when the president signed his order are now unable to return to the U.S. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nTrump says he will make Christian refugees a priority \n  \n\n\u201cThe impact of what President Trump was looking for is in full effect,\u201d Ayoud said. \u201cComplete chaos.\u201d \n \nIn Tehran, Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said his country would respond by banning all U.S. citizens from the country as long as the U.S. policy was in effect, but would not include anyone who already received a visa. In a statement, the foreign ministry called the U.S. order \"a clear insult to the Islamic world, and especially to the great nation of Iran.\" \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nFact check: President Trump's first week on the job \n  \nIn signing the executive order, Trump said the new administration needed time to develop a stricter screening process for refugees, immigrants and visitors. \"I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,\" he said. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nTrump executive order sows fear among refugees in Ariz. \n  \nThe executive order, which he said was aimed at protecting Americans from terrorist attacks, singled out Syrian refugees as \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" \n \nWhen the refugee program resumes, the executive order calls for changes to \"prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\" \n \n\"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\" Trump said. \n \nCAIR said it will file a federal lawsuit Monday in the Eastern District of Virginia to challenge the constitutionality of the order, charging its apparent purpose and underlying motive is to ban people of the Islamic faith from Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nIn N.Y., refugees awaiting family face uncertainty, fear \n  \n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d said CAIR National Litigation Director Lena F. Masri. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n \nMarielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups representing the Iraqi men detained at JFK, said the lawsuit is directed solely at immigrants who have been caught in legal limbo following Trump\u2019s announcement. The lawyers are trying to expand it into a class action suit to cover the untold number of refugees caught in the same situation. \n \nHincapié said they are planning separate lawsuits challenging the legality of Trump\u2019s executive actions on immigration, partly because they target majority Muslim nations. But she said for now, they simply want to resolve the cases of people who are being detained at airports. They are trying to get an emergency hearing before a judge this weekend. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nIn Kentucky, Trump order \u2018devastating\u2019 to local refugees \n  \n\u201cThese are people who already had a horrific experience of being a refugee,\u201d she said. \u201cThey left everything behind. And now, to find themselves in detention at an airport with no contacts, not knowing what can be done, only hearing little bits and pieces on the news about this executive order. I think folks are just scared and don\u2019t know how to respond at this moment.\u201d \n     \nAutoplay \n \nShow Thumbnails \n \nShow Captions \n  Last Slide Next Slide     \n1 Complaint by Doug Stanglin on Scribd \n         CLOSE       EXECUTIVE ORDER ON REFUGEES SPARKS PROTESTS Protestors rally at JFK Airport over President Trump's executive order | 1:42  \nLawyers say dozens of travelers from countries named in President Trump's recent executive order were held at John F.

Before arriving in Seattle, Graham spent the first five years of his career being one of Brees\u2019 top targets on one of the league\u2019s most explosive offenses. Growing his way to stardom, Graham recorded 4,752 receiving yards on 386 catches and 51 touchdowns while with the Saints. \n \nHowever, their bond goes significantly beyond the pass completions, receiving touchdowns and other accomplishments they set in the NFC South. Graham and Brees have an incredible relationship that\u2019s closer than what the average person can see, and one that is truly bigger than football.  \n \n\u201cI was a young player there and he really kind of molded me,\u201d Graham said following the final day of practice before Sunday\u2019s Pro Bowl game.\u201cI remember coming in as a rookie and him telling me that I was going to be special, and I\u2019m like, \u2018huh? OK.\u2019 He treated me like a little brother.  \n \n\u201cReally, it\u2019s been awesome to see his family again and to really catch up. I love his boys, they\u2019re just a bunch of fun. I used to spend Thanksgiving with him and his family, so to really connect with them and spend some time has been awesome. It\u2019s been unbelievable to be able to talk to him about his year, it was special. He\u2019s such a special mind, so that was good.\u201d  \n \nAdded Brees: \u201cHe really became like a brother to me, and we still stay in touch, we still talk. He was really like a part of the family, my kids love him. It was hard when all that went down (Graham\u2019s trade to the Seahawks), but I think that he\u2019s had some great opportunities up in Seattle. It\u2019s a kind of a different stage in his career transitioning to a new team, but to watch him grow and become the leader that he is and the player that he is and all those things, I just appreciate and very much value the time that we had together in New Orleans. I know that we\u2019re always going to be very close because he\u2019s like a brother to me.\u201d  \n \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BPysWqoAEIG/ \n \nAn aspect that sometimes comes with brotherhood is witnessing one having to overcome adversity. A challenge came for Graham last season when he suffered the first significant injury of his pro career against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 12. Graham tore his patellar tendon and spent the next few months engaging in tenacious rehab. Despite being miles away, Brees\u2019 support remained. \n \n\u201cHe reached out right when I got injured and and just told me if anybody can come back, I can,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe knows my work ethic and it was awesome being able to connect with him through those times.\u201d \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody understood the significance of his injury and what he had to overcome, especially for a guy his size and the way he\u2019s required to move on the field as a tight end,\u201d Brees explained. \u201cTo overcome a patellar tendon injury and to have the season that he had \u2013 a Pro Bowl season, obviously \u2014 it just tells you everything you need to know about who he is and what he\u2019s had to overcome in his life. Whatever the challenge or obstacle is, he\u2019s going to overcome it.\u201d \n \nIn his second season with the Seahawks, Graham answered all questions regarding whether or not he\u2019d be able to return to his All-Pro form. He caught 65 passes for 923 yards, both of which were single-season franchise records for a Seahawks tight end, and added six touchdowns while offering several jaw-dropping highlight plays in the process.The 923 yards ranked third among tight ends and he averaged 14.2 yards per reception, which ranked No. 1 at his position. Head coach Pete Carroll also raved about Graham\u2019s improvement as a blocker. \n \n\u201cTremendously,\u201d Carroll said during the regular season when asked about his improvement in that area. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you guys notice that, but he has been a great perimeter blocker for us. He just kind of embraced the whole concept of getting after the line of scrimmage and much better than last year, I think better by far than in years past. He\u2019s a force and he\u2019s had a ton of highlight blocks and plays and stuff, he\u2019s such a great body, his wingspan is so big and he\u2019s so powerful that he\u2019s now applied it and he\u2019s been a big asset to us. He\u2019s really become a complete player.\u201d \n \nMuch like Graham set out to dominate his return to the field after injury, he has a plan for this offseason. Graham said he will link up with quarterback Russell Wilson to continue to grow their relationship. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s really why I\u2019m excited about this offseason, being able to have an offseason with Russ,\u201d Graham said. \"My first offseason I\u2019m learning the offense and then this past year, I got zero reps with him. So this offseason, I\u2019m going to go to L.A. a little bit and he\u2019ll come see me.

You say \u2018who negotiates these deals?\u2019 not to mention millions of jobs and thousands of plants closing down all over our country,\u201d President Donald Trump told Republican leaders Thursday at their winter retreat in Philadelphia. \n \nTrump\u2019s plan was revealed just hours after Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a meeting with Trump scheduled for next month in Washington, D.C., which was brought on by repeated calls and tweets from Trump ordering that Mexico pay for construction of a border wall, which could cost $15 billion or more. \n \nA rift between our nations in the form of a trade war could have severe consequences on the Rio Grande Valley. \n \nMexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the United States, something we all witness daily as trucks full of produce and goods cross the international bridges here. \n \n\u201cI want to go a different route. We have no choice,\u201d Trump declared. \n \nThat should strike at all of us. We must realize that as the political rhetoric amps up \u2014 and we predict it will continue in the months and weeks to come \u2014 then the economic challenges for the Valley will grow and our need to diversify and not be reliant on a relatively few revenue streams should become all too clear. \n \nIn short: We cannot be complacent. We must be innovative, creative, frugal and flexible. We must seek out dynamic and untapped methods that will provide sustainable funds if we are to continue to grow our region in what appears will be the new normal. \n \nWe must promote science, technology, engineering and math graduates who can compete and contribute with the best scientists at SpaceX\u2019s new space launch facility at Boca Chica Beach; move forward with desalination efforts to lower our region\u2019s dependence on current water sources and expand our agriculture abilities here; tantalize new industries, such as those in the technology fields, with our appealing climate, friendly smiles and unique culture. And we must endeavor to attract Mexican shoppers and convince them to invest in our products. \n \nThe city of McAllen has given $1.1 million in taxpayer funds to help renovate the Anzalduas International Bridge on Mexican soil so that truck traffic can flow from the United States to Mexico. \n \nWe have the highest per capita sales tax revenues in the state of Texas because we cater to Mexican shoppers here. Unfortunately, those sales have been declining with the dip in the Mexican peso. But we must keep attracting them. \n \nAs Darling said: \u201cThe good news is that they\u2019re still coming, regardless of Washington\u2019s rhetoric.\u201d \n \nWe have a shared history and a proven commitment and established relationships with our Mexican counterparts that those in Washington, D.C., do not have \u2014 nor, frankly, appear to care much about. \n \nWe must not despair but we must prepare. \n \nWe must seek out new relationships and recruit \u201cunique\u201d retailers, as Darling suggests. We must encourage foreign travelers to subscribe to the many shows coming to McAllen\u2019s new $41 million Performing Arts Center (including the \u201cJersey Boys\u201d next month.) We must support our local universities, which in turn bring in more students to our area and more federal and state dollars for grants and studies. \n \nOur time of change is upon us.

We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\" READ: The company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships.\n\nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others.\n\nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues.\n\nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks.\n\n\"We don't see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\" Harris-Burland said.\n\nREAD: Amazon makes first drone delivery \n\nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland.\n\nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \"customers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\" and collect the goods at the door.\n\nMapping sidewalks\n\nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers.\n\nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots.\n\nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector.\n\nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. READ: Starship says one of its strong points is its \"visual localization\" technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets.\n\n\"We can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\" Harris-Burland said.\n\n\"A lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\"\n\nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \"99 percent autonomous,\" according to the spokesman.\n\n\"We want a human being able to oversee the robot's journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\" he said.\n\nHarris-Burland said the company's tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism.\n\nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \"to the nearest inch,\" he said.\n\nAFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"}],"title":"New wave of robots set to deliver the goods","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ENCA","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353328599","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2736"},"name":"ENCA","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.enca.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197858087","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.enca.com/encadrupal/styles/600_383/s3/000_KV9PS.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Surat Basin Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"384829406","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Surat Basin Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.suratbasin.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197869962","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11790","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stony Brook","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Three Village Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169690746","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Three Village Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.threevillage.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695197870332","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But law enforcement may bear the heaviest burden of all. With every encounter, officers have to wonder if they'll be facing someone who is dangerously unstable and potentially violent. That possibility is always high. Among the inmates of the nation's jails, 15 percent of men and 31 percent of women have a serious mental illness, according to a 2015 study by the VERA Institute of Justice. \n \nThe last few years' spate of high-profile shootings \u2014 both by and of police officers \u2014 has escalated the tension almost unbearably in some communities. Police are acclimated to keep situations under control, but people with mental illness can be unpredictable, their responses to commands defiant or disassociated. Police are expected to quickly identify aggressors and perpetrators among victims and bystanders, but someone caught in the grip of delusions or paranoia can slide suddenly from any of those categories to another. And most police are motivated by the need to make positive change in their communities. Yet they end up confronting the same individuals time and again, often with only one option \u2014 jail \u2014 and the knowledge that people they haul to the local jail or crisis unit could be out again within a day. \n \nIt's no wonder many officers say they feel a mounting sense of powerlessness and futility. And Florida \u2014 ranked the second-worst state for mental health funding per capita, according to a study by Our Health Policy Matters (Florida spends $222 per person on mental health services, while Idaho is the worst at $143 spent per person) \u2014 does a particularly poor job of supporting Floridians struggling with mental illness and the communities in which they live. \n \nThose communities and their law enforcement agencies can't afford to pass the buck the way Congress and state legislatures can. Law enforcement leaders are looking for more peaceful and predictable solutions. There is clearly more to be done. Crisis services can help avert an immediate tragedy, but the Baker Act only authorizes treatment until a person is deemed stable. Florida needs better options for those who require long-term treatment and medication.  \n \nToo many Florida leaders still see treatment services as acts of charity, or luxuries. Florida law enforcement officials know better: It's a matter of community well-being and public safety, and too often, police officers are the ones who suffer when the safety net snaps.

Coming into Saturday\u2019s game against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers both teams are fighting for the fourth and final spot in the Western Conference. \n \nLuckily for the Warriors, they walked off the court clinging on to a small lead in the playoff push after they defeated the Vipers 123-115 in front of a full house on Saturday night at Kaiser Permanente Arena. \n \nThe Warriors \u2014 who shot franchise single-game record 60.6 percent on 3-point shot attempts Friday night \u2014 saw guard Scott Wood set a career mark after he shot 50 percent (10 of 20) on long-range shots. He finished with a game-high 32 points. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s great\u201d Warriors coach Casey Hill said. \u201cAnytime he gets open that many times, he\u2019s capable of doing that.\u201d \n \nHill said he was actually surprised that Wood didn\u2019t make more 3-point shots. \n \n\u201cHe is one of the best shooters I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHe\u2019s confident, without being cocky, when it comes to his shooting, which allows his teammates to basically really grasp on to that.\u201d \n \nThe Warriors, who are in second place in the Pacific Division behind Los Angeles, gained some ground with the win. They sit just five games behind the D-Fenders. \n \nIt was the first set of back-to-back games for Santa Cruz (16-12) since the beginning of January when they played against Austin and Rio Grande Valley. It was also the last time the Warriors faced the Vipers when they lost in a shootout, 155-148, in Hidalgo, Texas. \n \nSanta Cruz now leads the season series against the Vipers 2-1. \n \nThe Vipers started the game with a 10-2 run led behind center Chinanu Onuaku\u2019s five points. Wood hit back-to-back 3-pointer to make it 13-8. \n \nThe Vipers\u2019 JP Tokoto was fouled hard by Warriors guard Alex Hamilton but managed to make a spectacular shot under the hoop with a little more than two minutes to go in the first quarter. The three-point play extended RGV\u2019s lead to 28-19. \n \nRio Grande Valley forced the Warriors to turn the ball over seven times in the first quarter and at one point had a 14-point lead. Hamilton led the Warriors with eight points in the first quarter, including a buzzer beating layup. Still, the Vipers had a 34-23 lead. \n \n \nWood started to heat up in the second quarter after he knocked in his third 3-point shot with a little less than nine minutes to go on the game clock but the Warriors never seemed to get close enough to tie or take the lead. \n \nWood added three more 3-pointers to give him 18 points at the half and the Warriors trailed by just three, 61-58. \n \nWood continued to shine and gave Santa Cruz its first lead of the game, 70-67, after his first 3-point bucket of the second half with eight minutes left in the third quarter. Wood put in two more 3-pointers to extend the Warriors lead to 11 points at 82-71. \n \nThe Warriors started the fourth quarter with an 18-point lead but things got a little interesting in the final two minutes of the game after RGV pulled to within four points, 117-113. But the Vipers couldn\u2019t complete the comeback. \n \n\u201cUnder a 100 points,\u201d Hill said about trying to hold RGV under a specific amount of points. \u201cI don\u2019t care what your philosophy is or how you play, I want to hold teams to under a 100.\u201d \n \nHill said it was doable, especially after allowing the Vipers to score just 17 points in the third quarter. \n \n\u201cKudos to them for not giving up,\u201d Hill said. \n \nRGV guard Darius Morris nearly finished with triple-double as he scored a team-high 24 points to go along with nine assists and nine rebounds. Not far behind was Tokoto, who finished with 22 points and Onuaku had 17 points. \n \nThe Vipers, who are in third place in the Southwest Division, fall to 17-13. \n \nWarriors guard Phil Pressey on the other hand recorded a triple-double as he finished with 15 points, 13 assists and 14 rebounds. A total of six different players finished with double-digits stats in points: Hamilton (20), Dennis Clifford (18), James Southerland (11) and LaDontae Henton (10). \n \n\u201cIt was a typical RGV game,\u201d Hill said. \u201cJust trying to make sure that these guys (Warriors) stayed focused on the right things. ... It was stressful but I love coaching those types of games, I love them.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Juan Reyes sports@santacruzsentinel.com @jmreyes831 on Twitter"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"D-League Basketball: Warriors hold off Vipers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monterey","zipCode":"93940","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Monterey","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Monterey Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169656828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"171"},"name":"Monterey Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.montereyherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197875136","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.montereyherald.com/storyimage/NF/20170128/SPORTS/170129727/AR/0/AR-170129727.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He had fresh, frisky legs and then some on Saturday night and left the Los Angeles Clippers grabbing their own hamstrings. \n \nCurry had his best all-around eye-candy performance of the season and the Warriors followed his lead in an absolute 144-98 demolition of the Clippers at Oracle Arena. They shot 62.5 percent in exploding out to a 21-point halftime lead, then really dropped the hammer and pinned a 45-point third quarter on L.A. with their two-time MVP guard looking every bit the part of lead entertainer and destroyer. \n \nThe Clippers were playing without veteran point guard and leader Chris Paul, who is recovering from thumb surgery, but it\u2019s unlikely Paul would have made that much of a difference on this night, even if he\u2019d brought Michael Jordan along. The Warriors came out smoking from the start and simply took it their alleged rivals at both ends of the floor. It was a most impressive way to win their eighth straight against their Southern California foes and also post their NBA-best 40th victory against just seven losses. \n \nBut Curry was particularly energized, scoring 43 points to go with nine rebounds and six assists over a mere three quarters, and he finished the first half with a exclamation-point flourish like only he can. With just under 30 seconds to go, he made a ridiculous baseline bounce pass between the legs of the Clippers\u2019 Jamal Crawford to Andre Iguodala under the basket for a dunk. Iguodala was so wowed by it he couldn\u2019t hold back a chuckle. \n \nCurry was just getting started. As time ticked off under five seconds, Curry out-jumped 7-foot L.A. center DeAndre Jordan for a rebound, raced to mid-court and let fly with a 50-footer from the center circle that swished through with 1.7 seconds to go. It only added to Curry lore on such \u201cmiracle\u201d shots. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a 50-50 chance it\u2019s going in, and I think that\u2019s pretty high,\u201d said Draymond Green. \u201cAfter you see something so many times, you just know there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s going to go.\u201d \n \nThe long bomb gave the Warriors a 72-51 lead and the Clippers were effectively finished. But Steph wasn\u2019t. He continued to light up Oracle in the third with a 25-point quarter that was vintage highest-level Curry. He made 8 of 11 shots, including 5 of 8 3-point tries and was plus-22 just for those 12 minutes alone as the Warriors expanded the lead to as many as 43. Curry outscored the Clippers all by himself in that quarter by two points. \n \n \nCurry was so dynamic, it allowed starting All-Star teammate Kevin Durant to have a \u201cquiet\u201d 23-point game in which he made 9 of 11 shots with seven assists. It was that kind of night. Even James Michael McAdoo went for double figures with 10. \n \nSo, Steph, about that quad tightness that had everyone worrying you might not even play .... \n \n\u201cSince we didn\u2019t have a shoot-around, I didn\u2019t know how it was going to react once I got moving and doing basketball activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI was pretty confident from the time I woke up that I was going to be able to go, but you don\u2019t really know until you get out on the court to test it out.\u201d \n \nAlready leading by 10, the Warriors\u2019 small lineup smacked the Clippers with a 17-6 run over the final 2 ½ minutes of the opening half and the rout was on. Curry said the half-court shot might have had some carryover effect, both for himself and his team. \n \n\u201cMy coach at Davidson, Bob McKillop, always talked about \u2018big mo\u2019 going into the half,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIf you can get a stop or a buzzer-beater, it usually has a carryover effect for the team. Me personally, you see a shot like that go in, you\u2019re obviously thinking about it at halftime, and I made my first shot coming out in the third quarter, so that just continued the trend.\u201d \n \nCurry joked that his rebound over Jordan was \u201can illusion\u201d and that his between-the-legs bounce pass to Iguodala was \u201cfrom the coach\u2019s eyes, probably one of those no-no-no-oh-good-pass situations.\u201d And speaking of \u201cbig mo,\u201d Curry also had a dribble-drive layup past ex-teammate Marreese \u201cMo Buckets\u201d Speights earlier in the game. \n \n\u201cIt was a good pick-and-roll situation, and I tried to get him activated,\u201d Curry said with a grin. \u201cWe can\u2019t it easy on him even though we love Mo around here.\u201d \n \nThe Warriors didn\u2019t take it easy on any of the Clippers, playing stout defense much of the night to set up their lethal transition offense. A signature play in the first half occurred when Green blocked powerful L.A. forward Blake Griffin driving to the rim, then raced to the end while Griffin was still gathering himself and blasted home a driving dunk. \n \n\u201cI thought Draymond was tremendous,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr. \u201cHis numbers aren\u2019t going to wow anybody, but his defense was phenomenal, and I thought that block he had on Blake was one of the key plays of the game just to fuel us. It got the crowd into it, and that\u2019s when we broke the game open.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Carl Steward Bay Area News Group"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry scores 43 as Golden State blasts Clippers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monterey","zipCode":"93940","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Monterey","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Monterey Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169656828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"171"},"name":"Monterey Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.montereyherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197875433","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.montereyherald.com/storyimage/NF/20170128/SPORTS/170129726/AR/0/AR-170129726.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

In fact, with high taxes and companies fleeing, most of these towns have become protest-based economies. \n \nThere were even demonstrations in Atlanta. Commuters were stuck on the roads of Atlanta for hours, and then the protests started. \n \nConstant, disruptive protests are a mild inconvenience for Trump. There are so many protesters in New York City that he has to be hidden, taken in the back entrance, and smuggled in by friends so he can work \u2014 the way about half of NYC residents got there. \n \nWhat I did notice with the few women friends I know who flew to Washington to protest is that they have no idea what they were protesting. Mostly, they did it so they can bring up at a cocktail party that they went to Washington (carbon footprint and all) and marched. It becomes all about them, not any real or pressing issue. Their self-important theatrics were taught to them by the education system and the media: Any protest, no matter the thoughtlessness of it, is a good protest. \n \nThe only march theme I heard was against \u201cintolerance.\u201d We are a very tolerant society, so maybe they are down to marching against lactose and latex intolerance. \n \nCouple that with the revelations by James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas, and others, that many of these protests are fake, nefariously funded by leftist groups like the DNC and MoveOn.org. These are not grassroots efforts, they are \u201castroturf\u201d movements, orchestrated for the eager legacy media cameras and knowing they will get ample time on the nightly news. \n \nThankfully, like the fable about the boy who cried \"Wolf\" so many times that no one paid attention to him when a real wolf appeared, these protesters elicit the same reaction. \n \nThese leftist ladies, who do not protest Sharia Law, flail at Trump and presuppose that he will enslave women, murder gays, take away reproductive rights, and tell women what they can wear. On the bright side, if this were true, libs would finally have their first Muslim president. \n \nI am not sure how loathing men and calling us pigs empower women. In watching Ashley Judd, Madonna and others use foul, hateful language toward Trump, I am more sure than ever that the left \u201chates\u201d the most. Trump just wants to take things that have not worked and do them a little differently. That is not hate, that is management. \n \nWashed-up celebrities love these protests. Madonna incited a group of protesters by saying she thought of \u201cblowing up\u201d the White House. As Fox's Greg Gutfeld wondered, what is it with Madonna and blowing things ... up? \n \nThe McCarthyism of liberals toward entertainment is quite hypocritical. They went out of their way to blackball any entertainer that performed at the Trump inaugural. Even the mechanical bear band and Chucky Cheese in D.C. wouldn\u2019t perform that weekend. Only the sweet Jackie Evancho, the 16-year-old who was the runner-up in 2010 on America\u2019s Got Talent, performed. The leftist Hollywood Mafia cannot wait to crush this little girl. \n \nIn reality, it helps Trump when weirdos are out protesting nothingness instead of meaningful issues like the Vietnam War, civil rights, women\u2019s suffrage or Michael Strahan leaving Kelly Ripa's show without proper notice. It makes America realize why we elected Trump. \n \nYet the media, which serve as fluffers for left-wing causes, will show up at every protest, even if 10 anarchists are meeting for coffee. Keep in mind, Time Magazine named Trump \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d and then spent the whole article explaining that they also once gave the \"honor\" to Hitler. \n \nThe key with Democrats is to keep their followers outraged so their lot in life never gets better and so they do not lose interest in protesting. They were all outraged at Chick-fil-A about a year ago and turned their mighty disruptive ire toward the chain. Their protests were effective; just look what they did to Chick-fil-A. They shut the restaurants down \u2014 every Sunday. \n \nRon Hart is a syndicated op-ed humorist, award-winning author and TV/radio commentator.

Patty Murray demanded she promise not \"to privatize public schools,\" DeVos replied, \"Not all schools are working for the students.\" \n \nWhen Sen. Bernie Sanders asked her to make \"universities tuition free,\" DeVos replied, \"I think that's a really interesting idea (but) there's nothing in life that's truly free.\" \n \nThose answers were fine. I suppose it's important for a nominee to be polite. \n \nBut what I wish she'd said was: \"No, Sen. Murray, I won't promise not to privatize! Didn't you notice the mess government schemes create? Many government-run schools are lousy! Private is better!\" \n \n\"Sen. Sanders, how clueless can you be? Your 'free' stuff is already bankrupting America! Your 'free' health care plan was rejected by your own state \u2014 once your fellow Democrats did the math. Then your wife bankrupted Burlington College! You call yourself 'socialist!' Haven't you noticed that socialism wrecks people's lives? You should resign in shame!\" \n \nSen. Elizabeth Warren demanded DeVos explain what she will do about schools like Donald Trump's \"fake university ... I am curious how the Trump administration would protect against waste, fraud and abuse at similar for-profit colleges.\" \n \nDeVos tried, \"If confirmed, I will certainly be very vigilant ...\" \n \n\"How?\" interrupted Warren, who went on to sneer, \"You're going to give that to someone else to do?\" \n \nWarren's attack was absurd because Trump University was not an actual college that received federal funding. As the Cato Institute's Neal McCluskey points out, \"Of course it wasn't, and the education secretary did not have jurisdiction over it.\" \n \nWhat DeVos should have said: \"I would do nothing about Trump University, you smearmonger! Trump U has nothing to do with schools that get federal money. Do you conflate the two just to make profit the villain?\" \n \nSen. Al Franken asked DeVos whether students' learning should be assessed based on \"proficiency or growth.\" Proficiency means a third-grader masters third-grade-level work. Growth means improvement \u2014 that's fairer to disadvantaged students, who start from behind. \n \nDeVos began, \"I would ... correlate it to competency and mastery ...\" \n \n\"That's growth. That's not proficiency,\" interrupted Franken, suggesting that DeVos didn't understand education terms. \n \nDeVos should have said: \"Senator, neither measure is fair to teachers or kids! The proficiency vs. growth argument is a by-product of your stupid No Child Left Behind law. Such federal micromanagement is terrible because every kid is different. That's why your opposition to choice is destructive. Of course, you don't even know how bad many government-run schools are. You sent your kids to a private school that charges $44,000 tuition.

He promises \"protection\" to prevent foreigners from \"destroying\" manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be \"destroying\" more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? \n \nThe company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns The Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the Pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation's commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. \n \nIn 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy's, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing another 150 (including some Kmarts). \n \nSears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation's population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Wal-Marts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern \u2014 meaning pre-Wal-Mart \u2014 global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Wal-Mart to master online retailing. \n \nAlthough e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy's and other \"anchor tenants\" that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, The New York Times reported that online retailing \"has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.\" \n \nThe Times quoted specialists' calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, \"destroyed\" lots of jobs \u2014 those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. \u2014 the holders of which moved on, and usually up. \n \nWriting at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it \"is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.\" If so, the \"problem\" is productivity. Nutting says \"Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy's does.\" The Times reports that \"the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. \n \nAll of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee's or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge's Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? \n \nThe reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth \u2014 and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers' choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. \n \nReactionary liberalism has long held, and today's faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs \"saved\" but not those which, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. \n \nMacy's flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels' nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America's first merchant to offer \"a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen.\" It was a ballpoint. \n \nWill the winner of the once-famous Macy's versus Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good. \n \nGeorge Will's email address is georgewill@washpost.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"George Will"},"topics":[{"name":"Trade news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"GEORGE WILL: Examining the real cost of protectionism in U.S.","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Okaloosa","zipCode":"32547","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Walton Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northwest Florida Daily News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659189","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"323"},"name":"Northwest Florida Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nwfdailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197876907","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 15 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197879467","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We have heard over and over again from those who have experienced abortion about the painful aftermath and their deep regrets. The doors to Catholic and other Christian churches are open to Christ\u2019s mercy and forgiveness along with post-abortion ministries such as Rachael\u2019s Vinyard, Silent No More and many other aftermath of abortion groups throughout our country. \n \nA new center has opened in Fort Walton Beach with assistance and needs for pregnant women, including medical. Approximately half the women in pro-life efforts today have had one or more abortions. When they are permitted to speak in classrooms, generally private schools, most, if not all who were pro-choice, change their mind. Young people deserve the whole picture \u2014 the truth.

It wasn\u2019t great in the first half (allowing 40 points) but it came together in the second half.\u201d \n \nAfter allowing Marist to shoot 48 percent in the first half and shoot 16 free throws (making 15), Fairfield held the Red Foxes to just 31.3 percent shooting over the final 20 minutes, pressuring them into missing all nine 3-point attempts and letting them score just 22 points. \n \n\u201cWe talked a lot about our defensive intensity going into the second half,\u201d senior forward Amadou Sidibe said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we did. We didn\u2019t wait to get punched, we threw the first punch and we kept punching.\u201d \n \nAnd those punches knocked the Red Foxes \u2014 still winless in 10 career tries at the Webster Bank Arena \u2014 back against the ropes and never allowed them to fight their way out of the corner. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a common thing, we\u2019ve had big leads before,\u201d Marist coach Mike Maker said. \u201cAnd when things start going South for us, we cave in, it goes really fast. Some of that is youth and immaturity, we have a very young roster \u2026 we\u2019re just not mentally tough. I just think they\u2019re settling for less than they\u2019re capable of.\u201d \n \nIn the first half, with Kristinn Palsson scoring 11 points and Isaiah Lamb adding 12, the Red Foxes used mini-runs of six points and seven points to take a 36-23 lead over Fairfield with 3:21 left. But the Stags put together a half-ending 11-4 burst, highlighted by a 3-pointer from Curtis Cobb with six seconds left after Thomas Nolan had stolen the inbounds pass with 10 seconds to play to get the Stags back in the game at 40-34. \n \n\u201cWe were getting some good shots but they weren\u2019t falling so we knew we had to keep defending,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cWe knew the shots would start falling in the second half and as long as we continued our defensive effort, we\u2019d be OK.\u201d \n \nDown 44-37 with 18:37 to go, Fairfield went on a 23-4 run over the next 11 minutes as that Stags defense forced Marist to miss seven straight shots and eventually, 10 of 11 shots in taking a 60-48 lead with 7:30 left. The Red Foxes never got closer than six the rest of the way. \n \nTyler Nelson led Fairfield with 21 points with Cobb\u2019s 20 right behind. Jerry Johnson Jr. added 14 and Jonathan Kasibabu scored six points, grabbed nine rebounds and blocked four shots. Lamb finished with 14 to pace Marist with Brian Parker scoring 13. For Cobb, it was his first double-figure game in the last five for the sophomore guard. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been a little down with some nagging injuries \u2026 they were bothering me a bit but the guys kept pulling me up,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThey kept telling me to shoot and be aggressive so that\u2019s what it was.\u201d \n \nSaturday\u2019s win was the start of a four-game home stand at the WBA \u2014 Manhattan on Tuesday, Niagara on Thursday and Quinnipiac on Feb. 6 \u2014 make or break time for the Stags to get back into the upper half of the MAAC standings. \n \n\u201cWe took a couple of days off after Monmouth (a 91-49 loss on January 22) and when we came back we said we were starting over and we\u2019re getting back to what we do well,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the strengths of the team.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2165","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Fairfield","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Liverpool Champion","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270728560","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Liverpool Champion","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.liverpoolchampion.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197899346","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n\nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n\nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n\nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\" Update your news preferences and get the latest news delivered to your inbox.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2481","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Byron Bay","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Byron Shire News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169698687","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Byron Shire News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.byronnews.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197904914","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T13:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"},{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(File Photo)  \nAfter a high-profile battle between two stalwarts\u2013 BJP \u2019s Arun Jaitley and Congress \u2019 Amarinder Singh in 2014\u2013the Amritsar Lok Sabha bypoll this year is seeing a low-profile but high-stakes contest with the parties leaving no stoned unturned to ensure their victory. \n \nThe three-cornered fight between Congress, BJP-SAD combine and AAP has been overshadowed as the by-poll will be held simultaneously with the Assembly polls in the state on February 4. \n \nThe by-poll has been necessitated after Amarinder resigned as an MP in protest against the Supreme Court verdict on the SYL Canal water sharing agreement. \n \nOf the over 14 lakh electorates registered in Amritsar LS seat, 60 per cent are Sikh voters, and the three parties have not ignored this fact. \n \nThey have fielded candidates who belong to the Sikh community and hail from the holy city, which is famous, among other things, for the Golden temple, Attari-Wagah border, the Jallianwala Bagh and for its food. \n \n66-year-old BJP\u2019s Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, Congress\u2019 Gurjit Singh Aujla (44) and AAP\u2019s Upkar Singh Sandhu(63) are among those in the fray. \n \nYou May Also Like To Watch This: \n\n \n \nChhina, who is considered close to Union minister Arun Jaitley, has formerly served BJP as its state unit\u2019s vice president and is now its executive member. Chhina had unsuccessfully contested the 2007 Assembly polls from the Amritsar-West seat. \n \nAujla, considered close to Amarinder, was appointed vice president of the Amritsar District Youth Congress in 1997 and has been District Congress Committee (Rural) president since 2013. \n \nAAP\u2019s Sandhu (63), who was formerly with SAD, had a brief three-month stint with the Congress before he joined Arvind Kejriwal -led party earlier this month. \n \nSandhu had resigned from SAD earlier in protest against the sacrilege incidents in the state and alleged failure of the state government in nabbing the culprits. \n \nStarting from Gurmukh Singh Musafir and then R L Bhatia, Amritsar Lok Sabha had traditionally remained a Congress bastion until a young Najvot Singh Sidhu (now 53) as a BJP candidate trounced Congress veteran and six-time parliamentarian Bhatia in 2004 LS polls. \n \nThe seat remained with Sidhu till 2014 when he made way for Jaitley to contest the Lok Sabha polls. Jaitley lost the seat to Amarinder. \n \nCricketer-turned-politician Sidhu remained the BJP MP from Amritsar, winning the seat in 2004, 2007 by-poll and in 2009. \n \nThe Amritsar parliamentary constituency comprises nine assembly segments. Five (Amritsar-East, Amritsar-West, Amritsar-North, Amritsar-Central and Amritsar-South) are in the Amritsar city and surrounding areas, four (Ajnala, Majitha, Raja Sansi and Attari) are outside it. \n \nOf the nine, Raja Sansi, Amritsar-West, Amritsar-Central are with Congress. Amritsar-East\u2019s BJP MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu and South\u2019s Inderbir Singh Bolaria of SAD have also switched over to Congress. \n \nMajitha, Ajnala and Attari are represented by SAD and Amritsar-North by BJP. \n \nIn his election meetings, Chhina promises to transform Amritsar and bring projects for various sections and also to take steps to further boost the tourism here. \n \n\u201cThis city has been declared as a Smart City but work is yet to get started, which I will ensure gets started at priority. We want to make Amritsar a top city and a top tourist destination,\u201d he said. \n \nHe said the border areas need more work on education and health services and he would seek a special package. Chhina promises development of border areas through Central grants and compensation for farmers with land across the barbed-wire fence on international border. \n \n\u201cOnce the SAD-BJP form the government for the third consecutive time in the state and you elect a BJP-SAD MP from here, it will further speed-up the works for public good,\u201d Chhina said. \n \nIn his campaigns, he also enlists development projects like Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Horticulture Institute and Smart City project. \n \nHe claimed the beautification of Golden Temple by the SAD-BJP government has boosted the tourist influx. \n \nCongress\u2019 Aujla has been raising the drug issue to hit out at the ruling Akalis, saying the menace is prevalent but the government has \u201cfailed\u201d to acknowledge it, \u201cleave alone taking any step to combat it\u201d. \n \nSidhu\u2019s step of recently joining the Congress has also bolstered the party\u2019s campaign. He has been going all out to attack the ruling Badal family for \u201clooting\u201d Punjab, and BJP for \u201cacting like a mute spectator\u201d to the whole thing. \n \nAAP\u2019s Sandhu says his party is the \u201conly hope\u201d for Punjab and could bring back its \u201cgolden days\u201d. \n \n\u201cWe all have seen the regimes of Congress and SAD-BJP. AAP is not just a political party but a new hope for all of Punjab\u2019s ills,\u201d he said. \n \nAlso dubbing Sidhu and Singh as \u201cabsentee MPs\u201d, Chhina said they \u201cignored\u201d the constituency and did not bring \u201ceven one notable\u201d development project for the area. \n \n\u201cSidhu remained three-time MP but did not visit the constituency for months together. Let him say what project he got during 10 years as MP. He was not available to his constituents but for most of the time he remained busy with other commitments. \n \n\u201cNow, he is contesting the MLA election from Amritsar- East but he will lose to BJP candidate because he stands exposed for his opportunism. He just makes headlines in newspapers during poll time and then flies back to Mumbai which is his permanent base in a way now,\u201d Chhina had told PTI on the sidelines of a public meeting here. \n \nChhina, who is also secretary of the powerful and historic Khalsa College Governing Council (KCGC), said Singh, \u201chardly attended Parliament and never raised voice on the issues facing people here\u201d. \n \nAddressing poll meetings, Aujla of Congress says the development of the holy city as a tourist, industrial and business hub will be his main agenda. \n \nHe promises to make holy city an education hub by opening more and more government schools and colleges, especially in the rural belt. \n \nPlease Wait while comments are loading...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"After Arun Jaitley vs Amarinder Singh in 2014, Amritsar sees low-profile LS bypoll","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Financial Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659519","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"110"},"name":"Financial Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.financialexpress.com","publisher":"The Indian Express Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197907331","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/01/Jailtely-Amarinder-s-file-photo-300x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2165","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Fairfield","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Liverpool Champion","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270728560","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Liverpool Champion","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.liverpoolchampion.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197909585","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report. \n \nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 13 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MyNBC5.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"610316583","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MyNBC5.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mynbc5.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197916700","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders.

But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n \nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n \nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n \nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n \nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n \n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\" \n \n© Distributed by LAKANA.

Photo: Carl Recine/Reuters \n  \nJurgen Klopp accepted responsibility for Liverpool's stunning FA Cup fourth round exit as Championship club Wolves earned a shock 2-1 win at Anfield. \n \nKlopp's line-up featured three teenagers and right-back Connor Randall starting his first game of the season, a selection which resulted in a third consecutive home defeat in the space of eight days. \n \nA home loss to Swansea all but ended Liverpool's hopes of catching Premier League leaders Chelsea, while Southampton won at Anfield in the League Cup semi-finals in midweek. \n \nLiverpool must now face Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday, fixture congestion which goes some way to explaining why Klopp chose such a weakened line-up against Wolves. \n \nBut the Reds boss was criticised by pundits, including England legend Gary Lineker and Liverpool great Mark Lawrenson, for his team selection and he accepted the blame. \n \n\"I'm responsible, I feel responsible for this performance,\" Klopp said. \"I thought we could do better and obviously we couldn't. \n \n\"I have to think about this, learn about situations, players and all games. It was an important game for us and we couldn't deliver. \n \n\"I was asked if it is the low point of my Liverpool time until now and I don't know if it is. \n \n\"But if it is, it's a perfect point to turn around because it is not possible to go lower. It is absolutely right that it feels bad. \n \n\"I don't feel that the players let me down. I am responsible for the line up. I saw them training and I thought that is the line up. \n \n\"I am responsible for the bad things. We could have played better. Each boy could have played better. For each single performance there is an explanation. \n \n\"I am never too harsh in criticism and you should not be too emotional.\" \n Damning  \nLineker was particularly damning of Klopp's approach to the FA Cup, a competition Liverpool have won seven times in their illustrious history. \n \n\"Don't get Klopp playing his reserves with no European football,\" said Lineker via Twitter. \n \n\"Shows a lack of knowledge of the depth in English football and respect.\" \n \nLiverpool's hopes of winning silverware this season are in tatters. \n \nBut Klopp refused to be critical of any of his youngsters, or the handful of senior players who lined up alongside them. \n \n\"We played a Championship team at Derby in the (League) cup and they had not a percentage of a chance. That is not years ago,\" Klopp said. \n \n\"It is not right to judge people in a very bad moment. It is not about not wanting, it is about not getting the right players in the transfer window. \n \n\"We have to go through the history of Liverpool, better sides lost against worse sides. We know what we have to change, only we have to show it. \n \n\"I cannot explain every single thing of today. I don't look for excuses. Whatever you write, whatever you say is absolutely okay.\" \n \nRichard Stearman headed Wolves in front inside the opening minute before Andreas Weimann doubled Wolves' lead before the interval. \n \nNot until the 86th minute could Liverpool finally break down Wolves' resilient defence, through Divock Origi, although the home side was unable to end their manager Paul Lambert's record of never having lost at Anfield, as player or manager. \n \n\"I've never been beaten here \u2013 that's with Celtic, Villa, Norwich \u2013 but that one is the best,\" Lambert said. \n \n\"That surpasses everything because of the gulf in leagues, the gulf in players. But what we've got is incredible team spirit and really good young players.\" \n \nAFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ian WHITTELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Liverpool news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Blame me says Klopp after Reds crash out","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Cape Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672929","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Cape Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Soccer","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capetimes.co.za","publisher":"Independent Online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197931114","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/image/2017/01/03/52911328RTX2WNCV.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But because Joseph trusted God and what he was saying, Joseph took the risk and went there because he knew that was the right place to be. \n \nThe Bible says, \u201cEven when I am afraid, I keep on trusting you\u201d (Psalm 56:3 CEV). Notice this verse says, \u201c when I am afraid,\u201d not \u201c if I am afraid.\u201d We may want a life of no fears in this world, but that only happens in Heaven. In this life, we\u2019re all going to face fears of one kind or another. \n \nWe have some big fears and some little fears. We fear the future, we fear what\u2019s going to happen with our jobs and our family, and we fear little things like whether we said the right thing to someone, whether that presentation went well, or even making a phone call. \n \nIn all of these situations, you have a choice to make. Are you going to let the fear control you, or are you going to take a risk of faith because you know you have a God who loves you? \n \nThat risk of faith could mean going someplace you\u2019ve never been before or forgiving someone you thought you couldn\u2019t forgive. It could mean leaving your job. A risk of faith could also be praying about something or deciding to trust God with a situation or a relationship you\u2019ve held tight in your hand. \n \nWhat Christ-like risk is God telling you to take in faith? \n \nPlay today\u2019s audio teaching from Pastor Rick >> \n \nTalk It Over \n What is the risk you\u2019ve put off taking that you need to take in faith?  With what does God want you to replace your fear?  What have you learned about God by taking a risk in the past? How does it encourage you now?  \nFor more Daily Hope with Rick Warren, please visit  pastorrick.com ! \n  Transformed Complete Audio Series  \nGet Transformed this year! \n \nDo you want to experience a real transformation from the inside out?

I am looking for him to guarantee a place for the next match. If he plays really well, obviously he stays in. If he doesn\u2019t play well, I have other choices. \n \n\u2018I have other players for the same positions. Against Hull on Thursday, I played Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard, the game before I played Juan Mata and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. They have to fight between themselves and win positions with their performances.\u2019 \n \nMartial was a big hit last season under Louis van Gaal after a surprise £36\u2009million move from Monaco which could rise as high as £58m. But he has struggled since Euro 2016, when France failed to win the trophy on home soil. \n \nMourinho has hit out at Martial\u2019s agent amid speculation he was trying to push for a transfer and has become frustrated with the forward failing to play to his ability. \u2018He has great conditions to become a top player,\u2019 said Mourinho. \n \nThere will also be a chance for England left-back Shaw, who hasn\u2019t played since November after missing most of last season with a broken leg. \n \nShaw, 21, is worried about being part of Mourinho\u2019s long-term plans though he is determined to try and win the manager over. \n \nBastian Schweinsteiger and Ashley Young may also feature. World Cup-winner Schweinsteiger has stuck it out at Old Trafford after being told to train with the reserves at the start of the season and Mourinho confirmed the German will win back his place in United\u2019s Europa League squad following the sales of Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay. \n \nYoung, 31, has grown disenchanted after feeling Mourinho had indicated he would get more first-team football, but a loan move or transfer depends on United having to help out with his estimated £120 000-a-week wages. \n \nUnited lost their 17-game unbeaten run at Hull even though a 2-1 defeat in the EFL Cup semi-final allowed them to progress to a Wembley final, where they will face Southampton. \n \nDefender Phil Jones admits the sluggish display against one of the Premier League\u2019s bottom-three sides was a wake-up call with United now on a run of three games without a win. \n \n\u2018The Hull result was not what we wanted,\u2019 said Jones. \u2018We were delighted to be through to a Wembley final but we weren\u2019t happy with ourselves. That took the gloss off it a bit. \n \n\u2018We conceded another sloppy goal. It takes some character to go on a long unbeaten run and to throw it away was so disappointing. I\u2019m devastated.\u2019 \n \nHe added: \u2018We set our standards high. It\u2019s not enough just to win a cup. We need to do more, we need to be pushing for more trophies.\u2019 \n \nMail on Sunday","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JOE BERNSTEIN"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester United news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Mourinho tells Martial: Flop and you're out","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Cape Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672929","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Cape Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Soccer","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capetimes.co.za","publisher":"Independent Online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197932475","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/image/2017/01/28/49508416RTSU32V.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But the Spaniard said past results were irrelevant. \n \n[embedded content] \n May the best man win  \n\"It's a different match, different moment for both of us. I think this match is completely different than what happened before,\" he said. \n \n\"It's special. We have not been there in that situation for a while, so that makes the match different. \n \n\"I really don't think about what happened in the past. I think the player who plays better is going to be the winner.\" \n \nThe pair last contested a Grand Slam final at Roland Garros three years ago. They also met in the Australian Open semi-finals in 2014, with Nadal winning each time. \n \n\"Now it's a different time. A lot of time has gone by,\" Federer said. \"I know this court allows me to play a certain game against Rafa that I cannot do on centre court at the French Open.\" \n \nIt will be Federer's sixth Australian Open final and his 28th Grand Slam decider in total, and caps a marvellous comeback after the second half of last season was wiped out by a knee injury. \n \nHe has thrilled his many fans with his revival, having not figured in a Grand Slam final since the 2015 US Open. \n \n\"This is the last one (match) so I will leave it all out here in Australia and if I cannot walk for another five months I will give it all I have,\" Federer said. \n \nFederer can become the first man to win five or more titles at three Grand Slam events, while Nadal stands to become the only man in the Open era to win all the majors at least twice. \n \nAFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Robert SMITH"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Federer, Nadal clash in blockbuster Aussie final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Cape Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672929","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Cape Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capetimes.co.za","publisher":"Independent Online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197932718","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/file/1/1012607/1295193071/image/93868572.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Four spin bowlers will be taken on tour \u2013 incumbent Nathan Lyon, left-arm orthodox pair Steve O'Keefe and Ashton Agar, and rookie leg spinner Mitchell Swepson.\n\nJohnson predicted Lyon would lead the attack, but said Australia must adapt to the conditions and utilise their considerable spin bowling contingent. \"They [Indian pitches] are bunsen burners at the moment, they've been turning a fair bit, South Africa lost a Test series there,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It's going to be very interesting ... I don't know whether they go for two or three spinners in a Test. \"I've just got a feeling we'll see something different, something maybe special. We'll see a very different side to what we're normally used to \u2013 we're going to see more spin bowling over there.\n\n\"That's a good thing because you've got to play the conditions in India. The stats say that our quicks are better over there but mostly it's the quicks that bowl over there, we don't really bowl a lot of spin. \"It was Shane Warne before that and over the last 10 or so years there's been a lot of changes with our spin bowling.\"\n\nAustralia lost their last Test tour of India 4-0, and not a single member of the Australian team has won a Test in the country.\n\nNot since 2004 when Warne was rubbing shoulders with Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Glenn McGrath has Australia won a series in India. \n\nJohnson played seven Tests there without success before retiring from the longer form of the game at the start of last summer.\n\nAfter some significant arm-twisting by Scorchers coach Justin Langer, the fearsome left-arm quick was enticed to have a season in the BBL and his signing proved a masterstroke.\n\nHe saved his best two performances for last, claiming a record 3-3 in the semi-final win over the Melbourne Stars before finishing with 1-13 in his side's towering nine-wicket win over the hapless Sixers.\n\n\"It's just a really good tournament, I was probably one that never embraced Twenty20 cricket when I was playing international cricket but now that's all I'm playing, that's very enjoyable,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"The crowds are amazing too. That was one thing that I probably noticed throughout this Big Bash is the crowd and support and talking to the guys \u2013 random punters coming up and saying 'I hope you have a good season' to guys that don't have the profile.\n\n\"To get that experience and that exposure through the Big Bash, it's great for them.\"\n\nAnd icing the cake on the Scorchers' third Big Bash title, Johnson said he planned on returning to the competition next year.\n\n\"I only want to do it if I'm going to perform and I guess this year was a bit of a see how it sort of goes,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"JL [Langer] was really good with me throughout, he just said: 'Come and have fun mate, there's no pressure, you're not the No.1 strike-bowler we just want you to go and have fun and enjoy it and whatever happens happens'.\n\n\"It turns out that competitiveness in me is still there so if the body holds up and I'm bowling well then yeah.

She is the first woman to hold the position, according to State Fair officials. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Flood, a fifth-generation Floridian. \u201cI think everybody brings different skills and different attributes to the job. I think I may be the youngest (director). I think it\u2019s something I can certainly contribute maybe in taking the fair in a direction it hasn\u2019t been before.\u201d \n \nFlood\u2019s family moved to Frostproof when she was in sixth grade. Her father, the late Alec Fulford, operated a cattle ranch, and the family still owns ranches in Polk and Okeechobee counties. \n \nFlood helped out on the ranch from a young age, and she joined the FFA (formerly known as Future Farmers of America) in seventh grade. She raised and showed steers at the Polk County Youth Fair throughout high school. She also served on committees judging livestock and citrus at the fair. \n \nFlood said her faculty adviser at Frostproof High, Jimmy Smith, encouraged her to exhibit her steers at the State Fair as well. She said she recalls rising at 5 a.m. to groom her animals before going to Tampa and parading her heifer around the ring in the Charlie Lykes Arena. \n \n\u201cIt taught me responsibility at a young age,\u201d Flood said. \u201cI had to budget what the costs were for feeding that animal. When it got close to the State Fair, I had to go out and find a buyer.\u201d \n \nFlood said the proceeds from her sale of steers helped her pay her way through the University of Florida, where she earned a degree from the agricultural leadership education program. \n \nPolitical roles \n \nShe soon moved into the realm of politics. In 1999, Flood became a legislative aide to Paula Dockery, then a state representative from Lakeland. She later worked as an assistant director of legislative affairs at the Florida Department of Agriculture under Commissioner Charles Bronson. \n \nA family crisis prompted Flood to interrupt her career. Her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and in 2006 Flood returned to Polk County to help care for him. \n \nAdam Putnam, then a Congressman, learned of Flood\u2019s situation and hired her to work as district director in his Polk County office. Putnam, a Bartow native, appointed Flood as his director of external affairs when he became Florida\u2019s Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services in 2011, the same year her father died. \n \nIn the new role, Flood became involved with overseeing the fair. The Florida State Fair Authority is a quasi-governmental entity that receives no taxpayer money. \n \nThe combination of her agriculture background and her connection to Putnam made Flood a natural choice when the position of leader of the State Fair Authority came open. \n \n\u201cShe brings a lot of good qualities,\u201d said Doyle Carlton III, chairman of the State Fair Authority\u2019s board of directors. \u201cShe\u2019s got high character \u2013\u2014 that\u2019s probably the main thing \u2014 and she\u2019s got a tremendous work ethic. Cheryl is a very detailed, thorough person, very hard working. I think the staff sees these qualities in her and responds favorably to her leadership style.\u201d \n \nFlood, who is married with a 4-year-old daughter, heads an organization with about 50 full-time employees and many seasonal workers. She now lives in Bartow and commutes to her job at the fairgrounds, which cover 300 acres near the junction of Interstate 4 and U.S. 301. \n \nThe State Fair Authority stages 200 events throughout the year in addition to the main event. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a 24-hour-a-day job,\u201d Flood said. \n \nExpanding on tradition \n \nThe State Fair maintains its tradition as a showcase for agricultural displays. The Midway beckons visitors with dozens of rides, such as the Arctic Plunge, Jungle Twist Coaster and Tilt-A-Whirl. \n \nThe fair also presents concerts and other entertainment daily. This year\u2019s musical lineup features such country stalwarts as Bobby Bare and Johnny Lee. \n \nFlood said she has worked to diversify the entertainment lineup. Beyond the expected country acts, the free entertainment options include Shalyah Fearing, an R&B singer who competed on the TV show \u201cThe Voice,\u201d and Mighty Mongo, a five-piece rock band from St. Petersburg. \n \nIn an effort to blend tradition with innovation, Flood has added an emphasis on social media opportunities to the State Fair using the theme \u201cPicture Yourself at the Fair.\u201d The event offers photo snap opportunities, such as decorated hay bales as backdrops, and encourages guests to share their photos on social media. \n \nAmong other offbeat additions, this year\u2019s fair offers an interactive, candy-themed exhibit called \u201cSweets: A Tasty Journey,\u201d that includes a replica of the Mona Lisa created with jellybeans. \n \n\u201cLike any organization, as the years roll by we have to adjust to make sure we are keeping up with the times,\u201d Flood said. \u201cI felt like it\u2019s important to bring something like that (candy exhibit) because it appeals to young kids and appeals to ages all the way up to senior citizens.\u201d \n \nFlood has been bringing her daughter, Alexa, to the fair since the girl was a baby, and she is mindful of presenting a lineup full of attractions for all ages. She said Alexa particularly enjoys the petting zoo and animal displays, and she always insists on a ride down the Dragstrip Fun Slide with Flood\u2019s husband, Edward Flood, an assistant state attorney for the 10th Judicial Circuit in Bartow. \n \nFlood said she expects one day to sit in the Charlie Lykes Arena and watch Alexa show livestock she has raised. \n \n\u201cI hope she\u2019ll be able to one day grow up and show cattle and do the things I enjoyed as a child,\u201d Flood said. \n \n\u2014 Gary White can be reached at gary.white@theledger.com or 863-802-7518.

Stay is national,\u201d ACLU Voting Rights Project Director, Dale Ho, said on Twitter. \n \nCrowds outside the Federal Court in Brooklyn, New York, cheered the news. \n \nThe ACLU said the judge ordered a list of detainees to be provided, and said it would go through the names and ensure they are released. \n \n\u201cBut the critical point tonight is no one can be sent back to one of these countries,\u201d Lee Gelernt, Deputy Director of the ACLU Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said. \n \nThe order, signed by Trump on Friday, puts in place a 120-day hold on entry of refugees to the U.S., and indefinitely suspends the admission of Syrian refugees until the president is satisfied that changes have been made. \n \nIt also suspends entry for 90 days from certain countries based on statute related to the Visa Waiver Programme. \n \nThe most recent version of that programme lists Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as countries to be affected by the President\u2019s order. \n \nTrump said the order was necessary to keep foreign terrorists out of the U.S. \n \nThe president had during his campaig and after taking office called for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of some people  entering the country. \n \nThe order has drawn many criticisms since Friday, prompting widespread protests especially in New York. \n \nProtests erupted in several airports across the U.S. on Saturday over the executive order, which turned into celebrations after the stay was granted. \n \nDemonstrators at a terminal at John F. Kennedy, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d \n \nThe ACLU had filed a lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were detained after arriving at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport following the order. \n \nThey were later released, and a senior Trump administration official said waivers would be granted. \n \nThe ACLU then said it was seeking \u201ca national stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in U.S. airports under the programme. \n \nAnthony Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU, said Trump\u2019s order would have caused people with valid visas and green cards to be turned back to Iraq, Iran and other countries. \n \nHe said the group believes around 200 people will be directly affected by Saturday\u2019s stay. \n \n\u201cClearly this is just the first day of what will be a very long battle,\u201d Romero said. \n \nHe said the onus was now on the Trump administration to prove the executive order is constitutional.

Introverts vs. Extroverts. Optimists vs. Pessimists. Jocks vs. Nerds. And all but a few of us fall somewhere between the two extremes. \n \nAnother, though less often discussed spectrum, is related to problem solving. The two extremes here are whether you are problem-focused or solution-focused. \n \nProblem-focused individuals are really good at identifying what the problems are and where they are causing difficulties. They have the capacity to analyze a situation, and figure out where the breakdown is occurring. \n \nBut what happens to individuals who are at the extreme end of the problem-focused spectrum? You probably know some of these individuals. They tend to see only the problems, and some see problems where there are none. \n \nSolution-focused individuals, on the other hand, are better at solving problems. They are really good at identifying interventions or strategies for resolving issues that are at the root of the problem. \n \nBut too much of this can be a problem as well. When all you can see are solutions, you often fail to see the real problem. If the check engine light is on and it is annoying you, the easy solution is to remove the bulb. But, of course, this does not solve the real problem, it only solves your immediate discomfort. \n \nThe differences between problem-focused and solution-focused individuals often arise in our relationships. If both partners are somewhere in the middle of the problem vs. solution spectrum, they are good at finding AND solving problems. But if one or both are at either end of the spectrum, difficulties can arise. \n \nConsider a couple where one of them only see only the problems. Every day, she talks about that day\u2019s problems. Every day, she complains about the problems and ruminates over the distress caused by the problems. Yet, when her partner attempts to identify a solution, all she can see are the problems associated with that possible solution. It is a never-ending cycle filled with \u201cyeah, but\u201d and \u201cnope, that won\u2019t work.\u201d \n \nOn the other hand, perhaps one of the partners is only solution-focused. In this case, he is always offering a solution. Although this may, at first, sound good, there are times when the other person just wants a chance to vent her frustrations or to share her feelings about something. But to the solution-focused person, every problem she brings up must have a solution. Instead of offering an understanding ear (and heart), he offers solutions. \n \nIn either scenario, the relationship is strained and sometimes buckles under the weight of stress and discord. Neither partner is having his or her needs met and both are becoming increasingly frustrated. If you are in such a situation, talk with your partner. Share with him/her that there is a problem with how you \u2014 as a couple \u2014 manage problems. Talk openly about your differences. These differences are not easily recognized, because they are rooted in your life experiences. Quite often, they are also gender-based. Women are more apt to discuss the problem and how it makes them feel. Men don\u2019t care, they just want to solve the problem and move on. If she wants to explain how she feels, he becomes impatient. If he just wants to solve it, she becomes impatient. \n \nThese differences are not easy to recognize or to change. So seek help from a professional if you cannot work it out together. There is a solution to this problem, but we must first identify the problem and accept that there is a solution. Both sides of this spectrum have to come together to resolve these issues. \n \n\u2014 Dr. Berney, a licensed psychologist with Psychological Associates of Central Florida in Lakeland, is a national speaker and the co-author of \"Handbook for Raising an Emotionally Healthy Child.\" You can hear Dr. Berney on his podcasts, \"The Mental Breakdown\u201d and \u201cThe Paedeia Education Podcast\u201d on iTunes.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Wilkinson: Are you problem-focused or solution-focused?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"33815","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lakeland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lakeland Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663260","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1400"},"name":"Lakeland Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197947136","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2330","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Singleton","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Singleton Argus","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170634248","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Singleton Argus","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.singletonargus.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197954361","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

People thought that Prescott would just calm the sea for some games before Tony Romo came back from his  plaguing back injuries. Instead, Prescott played on another level and took Romo\u2019s starting spot from him, leading the Cowboys on an 11-game win streak en route the NFL\u2019s best record. \n \nWith the Cowboys getting a bye for the first round of the playoffs, every Cowboy fan, media member and analyst not named Stephen A. Smith or Shannon Sharpe had them going to Houston to play in the Super Bowl, but thank God for the Green Bay Packers. \n \nI am a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan, so unlike all the other Dallas Cowboys fans out there, including my uncle, I can give the other teams credit. The Cowboys were the best team in the NFL. They had the best offensive line, the best rushing attack and a consistent defense and passing attack. However, even though they beat the Packers once during the season, I knew the playoff game would be a different story. \n \nAll Cowboys fans thought they were going to destroy the Packers like they did the first time around. My Green Bay Packers came into Jerry\u2019s world and set the tone. \n \nAaron Rodgers and company scored 21 unanswered points on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team.\u201d The first quarter was still in progress, and the Cowboys\u2019 players and fans already looked  defeated. Of course the Cowboys got their act together and made a game out of it, but when the deck was stacked, my main man Rodgers made an all-time-great pass to tight end Jared Cook who did the Michael Jackson slide on the sideline to secure the catch that set up the game-winning field goal by kicker Mason Crosby. \n  \nCrosby was the real hero of this game, making three 50-plus-yard field goals that tied and won the game for the Packers. \n \nAfter the game was over, Cowboys fans all over were making up excuses, as usual, as to why the Packers won. I heard many excuses, but I never heard the truth. The truth was the Dallas Cowboys underestimated the Green Bay Packers, and they dug themselves too deep of a hole to get out of. Never underestimate the heart of a champion. \n  \nThe following days were brutal for Cowboys \n \nfans as they couldn\u2019t seem to get over how their team lost. On the Monday following the game, the world just seemed quiet. The air didn\u2019t feel the same, TV didn\u2019t look the same and people seemed dead. \n \nIt was great watching my Packers defeat the Cowboys in the most watched playoff game of all time, but it was even greater to see and hear all the reactions and excuses from the saltiest fan base known to man. \n \nI understand the football in Texas is a r eligion, and the Dallas Cowboys are God to some people, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s just a game.  \n  \nI personally have no ill-will toward the Cowboys, and I couldn\u2019t care less what they do. They can win all the games they want, just as long as they\u2019re not playing the Packers. \n \nI believe the young and promising backfield the Cowboys have, along with the offensive  line and all the talented receivers, will be a force to reckon with for years to come, but this year wasn\u2019t their time. As long as Rodgers and the Packers are in the NFC, the Cowboys will have to cut the cheese. \n \nI have a message for Dallas Cowboy Nation: your team had a great year, but they lost fair and square. Prescott, Elliott and Dez Bryant all showed up to play, but the Cowboys still lost. \n \nSo quit crying, complaining and losing your mind over a team that doesn\u2019t even know you exist. If you want to blame anybody for the loss, blame the coaching staff because they dropped the ball on numerous occasions throughout the game. \n \nJerry Jones doesn\u2019t pay your bills, Elliott doesn\u2019t put your kids through college and Prescott doesn\u2019t put food on your table every night. The Dallas Cowboys lost, and the Green Bay Packers won\u2014plain and simple. Go Pack go. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Devin Brooks, Sports editor"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Green Bay Packers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Dallas Cowboys news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dallas Cowboys fail To Cut The Cheese in Playoff Game","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nacogdoches","zipCode":"75962","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Nacogdoches","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Stephen F.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

Each story takes about 15 minutes to complete. \n \n\u201cIt was really an eye-opener,\u201d Shannen Fitzgerald said. \u201cThe kids that went with me were really quiet as they took in everything. We don\u2019t know what we have. In the story of Rueben, he was so happy to have a toy truck. Just think of all the things we take for granted.\u201d \n \nAt the end of the experience, patrons are given a chance to sponsor a child for $38 a month. This tax-deductible gift provides them with medical checkups, nutritious food, health and hygiene training, education assistance, surgeries and disaster relief, mentoring and a faith-based opportunity. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s so moving to see how far removed we are from that kind of lifestyle,\u201d Ron Lessard said. \u201cIt should be a wake-up call to us all and allow us to help one another.\u201d \n \nThe Compassion Experience will be open 11 a.m. to 6:40 p.m. on Sunday and 11:40 a.m. to 7:20 p.m. on Monday at First Baptist Church, 220 N 13th St., Leesburg.

Don Hahnfeldt, R- The Villages, and Rep. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, filed the \u201cFlorida Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\u201d making it a third-degree felony to perform an abortion after 20 weeks; it also requires physicians to report abortion information to the Department of Health. \n \nAccording to the legislation (HB 203) \u201c20 weeks after fertilization, an unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human.\u201d \n \nBut published research in the Journal of the American Medical Association based on studies related to the pain of an unborn child showed that \u201cevidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester.\u201d \n \nThere are 13 states that ban abortions after 20 weeks. \n \n\u201cThis is a step in the right direction regardless of what the medical experts say,\u201d Hahnfeldt said. \u201cI believe that life is a gift and it begins at conception. We should make effort to protect the life of an unborn child just as we do after delivery.\u201d \n \nHahnfeldt said his preference would be to mirror what the state of Ohio was trying to do in outlawing abortion at six weeks. \n \n\u201cBut Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, vetoed the bill being that it would not be successful in the court system,\u201d he said. \n \nHahnfeldt\u2019s legislation is just one of several controversial bills by local representatives and senators concerning religious expression in schools; narrowing the scope of the Lake County Water Authority; exempting law enforcement officers from handgun purchase waiting period; and limiting to 12 consecutive years the number of years Supreme Court justices and judges may hold the same office. \n \nSen. Dennis Baxley, R-Lady Lake, filed legislation prohibiting a school district from \u201cdiscriminating against students, parents or school personnel on the basis of religious viewpoints or expression,\u201d according to information on the bill. \n \nThe bill (SB 436) also gives students permission to wear clothing, jewelry and accessories displaying religious messages or symbols. It also specifies that a \u201cschool district may not prevent school personnel from participating in religious activities on school grounds that are initiated by students at reasonable times before or after the school day if such activities are voluntary and do not conflict with the responsibilities or assignments of such personnel.\u201d \n \nCaroline Mala Corbin, professor of constitutional law at the University of Miami School of Law, raised some questions about the bill. \n \n\u201cIt is not clear how broadly it would be interpreted,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is always a possibility that it could clash with the establishment clause of the Constitution. It is the clause that requires separation between church and state. Teachers are government employees. The teachers are the government. The government may not favor one religion over the other. They are more limited in their capacity as school teachers rather than private citizens.\u201d \n \nBut Baxley disagreed. \n \n\u201cI think it\u2019s irrational to think that a person\u2019s worldview does not color their expression of how they look at things,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are seeing is an attempt to sterilize the environment from any expression of faith. I don\u2019t think free expression of faith crosses the line that you are establishing a state religion.\u201d \n \nCorbin also questioned what motivated the law considering that students already have freedom of speech and freedom of religion. \n \nBaxley said the bill was brought to him by Rep. Kimberly Daniels, D-Jacksonville. \n \n\u201cShe and I share a concern about freedom of religious expression because in many of the school policies they are prohibiting teachers from participating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are cracking down on wearing any emblem that expresses your faith. They are prohibiting prayer, even student initiated prayer. We still sense there is evidence of suppression of people\u2019s free expression of their personal faith.\u201d \n \nThe Lake County Water Authority and its mission and authority has become another point of contention this legislative session. \n \nRep. Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, is filing legislation that revises the Lake County Water Authority\u2019s Enabling Act, which operates like a charter for the district. It establishes the powers and duties of the district. \n \nThose changes include: prohibiting the LCWA from using public funds to actively promote recreation and tourism; prohibits active parks, except for Hickory Point Park, and allows passive parks on LCWA property; and leaves in place the core mission of improving and protecting the streams, lakes and canals of Lake County, according to a press release from Metz\u2019s office. \n \n\u201cI am trying to revise the Enabling Act of the Water Authority to ensure it stays focused on its core mission of protecting our lakes, rivers and streams and to prevent it from performing functions that belong to other government agencies like parks and recreation, tourism, promotion and economic development,\u201d Metz said. \n \nBut Mike Perry, executive director of the LCWA, said its board was taken aback by the bill. \n \n\u201cThey are not sure the bill is necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have not strayed from their primary mission and it has never misused many of the powers it is given. They are elected officials and responsible to the electorate. They are concerned about having things like eminent domain that Rep. Metz wants to take away from us. He wants us out of the tourism business, particularly active recreation, and the board has never expressed an interest to do anything like Hickory Point. Some of the language would restrict us from being able to construct boat docks on our existing property.\u201d \n \nBut Lake County Commissioner Sean Parks and Baxley support the legislation. \n \n\u201cIf the LCWA is a special district, special districts should periodically be reviewed for efficiency and efficacy of purpose,\u201d Parks said. \u201cRep. Metz is simply re-evaluating the purpose of the LCWA and in doing so is being mindful of the taxpayer.\u201d \n \nAnd Baxley said Metz was clearly on \u201ctrack to articulate the (LCWA\u2019s) mission.\u201d \n \n\u201cRight now it is a little too broad and they have something like eminent domain rights, which I don\u2019t think belongs there,\u201d he said. \n \nAny legislation concerning firearms always seems to bring a fair amount of debate. \n \nHahnfeldt filed a joint resolution with Rep.

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff in rest homes as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waikato Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169690101","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Waikato Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197966859","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I refuse to give a gift card or money, as I feel it's like saying I didn't feel like bothering to shop for that person or don't know the person well enough to know what he or she would like. To me, gifting is a loving gesture, and even if someone chooses something for me that is not perfect, I get pleasure knowing that the person thought of me when choosing the item. \n \nBut every year, when I open my best friend's gift, I am disappointed. We've been best friends for 30 years. This year was the worst. It was as if she went through her drawers and gave me everything she didn't want. She gave me foot lotion, a DVD I will never watch, a shirt and a bottle of wine. The foot lotion was in a box that was all tattered and worn. The shirt was her size, not mine, and it smelled like old perfume. The wine was sweet red, and she knows I drink only dry. To top it all off, it was all thrown in a ragged gift bag that said \"Happy Birthday\"! \n \nI was so hurt. I spent days looking for the perfect gift for her, and I spent a lot of money. I also gave her a huge container of homemade Christmas cookies and candy that she loves. \n \nI have never been one who cares much about what I get; I get my pleasure from giving and knowing I made someone happy. But I just cannot help but be hurt. I haven't spoken to her since Christmas, and she has been texting me, asking whether I liked the gifts. Am I being overly sensitive or selfish by feeling the way I do? Should I confront her about this? -- Feeling Used in New York \n \nDear Feeling: It sounds as if you're gifted in the art of finding someone just the right present, and that's great. But not everyone is the type. Presents may not be that big of a deal to your friend, or perhaps money's too tight for her to go all out. She did at least try to put something together. If she's a good friend in all other respects, be thankful for that. Keep staring the gift horse in the mouth and it's liable to take a bite out of your friendship. \n \nDear Annie: My partner and I took in a young homeless man and have come to find out he has a mild mental illness. Our problem is figuring out how to include him in activities. We want him to feel that he is welcome and a part of the family. He does go to what he calls classes, but when he comes home, he goes back to his room. Any ideas on how to make him feel wanted and welcome? -- Concerned in Kentucky \n \nDear Concerned: It will take time for him to adjust to his new life and be comfortable, so let him have the space he needs. He's probably accustomed to keeping people at a distance. But a great and important place for familial bonding is the dinner table. Make a habit of cooking for him and eating together as a family every night. \n \nBeyond that, seek help from a licensed counselor. Mental illness, like any illness, can become more serious and debilitating if left untreated. It was very kind of you and your partner to take this young man in, and now the kindest thing you can do is find him the help he needs. \n \n======== \n \nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.

I have two much younger brothers from my mother's second marriage. They live with her in another state. \n \nRecently, Mom admitted that she is an alcoholic. I've always had my suspicions, but was never sure, since we weren't close. When my husband and I went to visit her last summer, we could see first-hand how severe it is. Mom barely weighs 90 pounds. She gets so drunk that she cannot walk or talk. She told us she has driven while drunk and that she also becomes violent. Not long ago, she broke several bones when she fell down the stairs. My brothers had to call 911. \n \nMom was not this way when I was growing up. Her divorce was only recently finalized, and she received custody of my brothers. I'm worried sick about them. Mom has no family in her town, and I am far away. My brothers' father is bipolar and a drug addict, so living with him is not an option. I'm trying to get my mother to move closer to me. How can I get some help? -- Desperate in Colorado \n \nDear Colorado: We're not sure what kind of help you need. Your brothers might be better off in your custody, if you are willing. Or, again depending on your tolerance and economic situation, you might take all of them into your home, Mom included, while you help her find employment and a place of her own. Perhaps other family members will offer financial assistance. Contact Al-Anon (al-anon.alateen.org), and also call 211 (Information and Referral services) for social service agencies that might help. \n \nDear Annie: My husband and I have been married for 15 years. We were both widowed. This past holiday season, he dragged in several boxes from the garage to decorate our house with things made by his first wife. They were dog-eared, tattered, yellowed calico fabric items in multiple colors and 40 years old. \n \nI gently told him that it insulted me that he wanted his first wife's decorations on the walls and mirrors. He blew up and started screaming, ranting and raving and got red-faced telling me these were \"his memories.\" I felt he was flaunting his past, and I surely didn't want this reminder through the holidays. He then pulled the tree out from the window and completely un-decorated it, took down all his wife's items, slammed things and pouted like a child. Then he slept in the spare bedroom. \n \nIt's been more than a month, and he is still pouting. I am still upset. I know my husband has major anger issues, but certainly it was OK for me to ask him to remove these things. I don't want his past life in \"our\" home. Are my feelings justified? -- Somewhere in Oregon \n \nDear Oregon: It is pointless to be jealous of a dead woman. You might have had a better reaction from your husband if you had lovingly incorporated his memories into your life together. But that doesn't account for his sudden interest in his late wife's decorations and his temper tantrum. We think something else is going on and hope you can gently and sweetly get him to open up about it. \n \nDear Annie: As a man who taught himself to cook while in college, I think you were way too easy on \"California's\" husband, who wrecks all the cookware when he attempts to make a meal. \n \nIf he's truly as low functioning as she describes, she shouldn't leave him alone in the kitchen to play with the stove. Instead, she should say that she expects him to replace what he's ruined. Then go to a thrift store and buy him an iron skillet and some other old-fashioned, \"manly,\" indestructible pieces of cookware just for his personal use. -- You're Just Too Nice \n \nThis Classic Annie's Mailbox column was originally published in 2012.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2330","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Singleton","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Singleton Argus","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170634248","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Singleton Argus","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.singletonargus.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197985934","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

startup is a step closer to reviving crisis-era derivatives that let investors bet on U.S. homeowner defaults. \n \nJPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Credit Suisse Group have given price data to the startup, New York-based Vista Capital Advisors, which rolled out the latest version of its pilot initiative this month, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Vista has been working on the project for the past few years with Intercontinental Exchange Inc. \n \nThe firm plans to use that data to create indexes of mortgage securities, which in turn would become the basis for the derivatives, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. \n \nThose three banks may not ultimately participate in writing the eventual derivatives, the person said. Representatives for JPMorgan, Bank of America and Credit Suisse declined to comment. \n \nThe derivatives would work much like ones created in the run-up to the U.S. housing crisis. Those products, known as the ABX indexes, were blamed for amplifying risks as big traders like American International Group wagered that subprime mortgage bonds would perform fine. After losses surged and the government had to bail out the financial system, demand for ABX bets faded. \n \nThe new derivatives, however, would be tied to higher-quality mortgages that are less likely to default. The indexes Vista is building are linked to mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac known as \u201ccredit-risk transfer\u201d securities, which force investors to bear losses when borrowers default on their loans, said Richard MacWilliams, Vista\u2019s co-founder. The underlying loans are safer, but the bonds are still riskier for their owners than standard Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds, which are fully supported by the government. \n \nDerivatives linked to these notes could be a test for how open investors are to new mortgage products a decade after the financial crisis. Fund managers in recent years have shown some signs of being willing to re-embrace risky securities and derivatives tied to home loans, such as subprime mortgage bonds. But these markets are still a fraction of their size pre-crisis. \n \nVista Capital, which calls itself a \u201cfinancial products innovation company,\u201d has some high-profile backers, including David Booth, co-founder and co-chief executive of Dimensional Fund Advisors; John Reed, former chairman of Citigroup; and Robert Merton, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won a Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work on the Black-Scholes formula for pricing options. Vista was previously known as eBond Advisors. \n \nTo be successful, derivatives linked to the indexes would have to help major banks manage their capital requirements, said Mike Edman, a former Morgan Stanley executive who helped invent credit derivatives on subprime mortgage bonds. \n \n\u201cAt a high level, it can make sense, but it seems regulatory capital is what the big banks focus on most,\u201d Edman said. \n \nCredit-risk transfer notes are an important mechanism for the government to reduce its support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were bailed out by taxpayers during the crisis after losing access to funding. While it is unclear how President Donald Trump will look to reform the two companies, Steven Mnuchin, nominee for Treasury Secretary, said in his confirmation hearing that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t just leave Fannie and Freddie as is for the next four or eight years under government control without a fix.\u201d \n \nSince 2013 when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began selling credit-risk transfer notes, the companies have offloaded nearly $40 billion of risk to bond investors. Derivatives could help boost these sales and lower taxpayer risks, ultimately, by making it easier for dealers to hedge their exposure to the notes, and by increasing the trading activity in the securities, Barclays wrote to housing regulators last year. \n \nFreddie Mac\u2019s Mike Reynolds, a vice president in the credit-risk transfer program, agreed that the idea has merit. A tradeable index could be \u201cfavorable, as it could alleviate the capital constraints that broker dealers currently have,\u201d and serve policy makers\u2019 goal of stepping back from the two government-backed housing companies, he said. \n \nBut there is also a potential drawback to the derivatives, he said: investors may decide to bet on the credit-risk transfer using derivatives instead of the cash securities, which could end up reducing demand for the bonds.

It was a large order for the stylist and custom clothier, but it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d been asked to outfit a bunch of really big and tall men. \n \nShe\u2019d already done four similar projects for other players, including former Broncos punter Britton Colquitt and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith. \n \nRequests like this come with the territory. Hutt has been making custom suits for seven years and currently works out of Windsor for b.spoke , a California-based clothier. Although she counts a couple of businessmen on her roster, her clientele is mostly professional athletes from a range of sports. \n Joe Amon, The Denver Post Paige Hutt is a Master Clothier and stylist with b.spoke. She was photographed Jan. 18, 2017 in Windsor, Colorado.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I was specifically seeking out,\u201d Hutt said of her niche market. \u201cIt just kind of worked out that way, but it\u2019s a small, small world.\u201d \n \nRelated Articles January 29, 2017   5 tips for buying and maintaining the perfect custom suit   A 6\u20197\u2033 and 300-pound lineman may require an extra yard or two of fabric compared to an average-sized businessman, but the process of creating a custom suit is the same for both. \n \nHutt visits a client at his home or office \u2014 in the case of the Texans, their locker room. She asks pointed questions about a client\u2019s career, lifestyle, body type and color preferences. She goes over his suit needs, existing wardrobe and price points. (B.spoke suits start around $1,295.) One hour and 28 measurements later, Hutt has what she needs. \n \n\n \nAfter sending the measurements and patterns to a factory, Hutt is walking back to the client four or five weeks later with clothing in hand. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s always an education process for both style-wise and fit-wise,\u201d Hutt said of the athletes she works with who typically are used to off-the-rack suits tailored \u2014 maybe \u2014 after the fact. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s always funny having an athlete,\u201d she continued. \u201cOn their very, very first custom suit, you can just see it on their face, \u2018Oh my God, this is so fitted.\u2019 They kind of do a double glance. \u2018Oh my god, this looks so good.'\u201d \n \nShe typically warns athletes that clothes may fit more snugly than suits off the rack. But a month after delivering an athlete\u2019s first custom suit, Hutt typically receives a call filled with enthusiastic thank yous. \n \n\u201cMost are super eager to be able to wear something other than their sweatpants,\u201d Hutt said. \n \nFor teams such as the Texans and Broncos that require players to dress sharp for away games, it\u2019s a chance to one-up each other, she said. \n \n\u201cThere always is a competition when guys want to be fresh,\u201d said Omar Bolden, a former Broncos safety and punt returner. \n \nBolden met Hutt in the fall of 2014, when Colquitt gifted the special teams custom sportcoats during a particularly good run of play.  Bolden, now a free agent, had always been interested in fashion but that was his first time having a custom coat. Previously, he\u2019d buy one from Men\u2019s Warehouse and have it tailored. \n \n\u201cI just absolutely loved the way it fit,\u201d Bolden said of the b.spoke coat. \u201cIt\u2019s completely different when the garment actually started from nothing.\u201d \n \nBolden said the five blazers and suits designed by Hutt are his favorites among the 12 he owns. \n Joe Amon, The Denver Post Paige Hutt, a Master Clothier and stylist with b.spoke. She styles, coordinates and maintains the wardrobes of professional athletes and business professionals nationwide. January 18, 2017 Windsor, CO. Joe Amon, The Denver Post  \nNot everyone can afford custom suits and there is no shame in getting a suit off the rack, he said. But if someone wanted to go custom, he advised that they establish a relationship with a tailor or stylist. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s more about the relationship and the chemistry I have with Paige than the custom suiting,\u201d Bolden said. \u201cI can get the custom suiting anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe football player said he tries to push the envelope with his fashion and Hutt helps him do it. B.spoke has more than 50,000 fabrics for clients to consider, which can be overwhelming, so Hutt will help hone down on something within the customer\u2019s wheelhouse, but still stretches his boundaries. \n \n\u201cI find that with my athletes, they\u2019re basic like, \u2018Paige, we trust you. I know who you dress and they look good,\u2019 \u201d Hutt said. \u201cThey leave most of the styling up to me rather than really picking out their fabrics. Some clients and athletes really love that and others have just seen what I\u2019ve done in the past and leave it up to me.\u201d \n \nClient Sean Withrow, a Denver investment consultant, described Hutt\u2019s role as similar to an interior designer. You may walk in asking for one thing, but then she offers other available options that change your mind. \n \nWithrow has worked with about six other custom tailors previously but has stuck with Hutt. In his line of work, he said it\u2019s important to make the right impression and not wear the same ill-fitting suit as competitors. \n \nWithrow says he\u2019s gone to Nuggets games and can tell which coaches and staff work with Hutt \u2014 they\u2019re \u201cthe ones that are a little better dressed.\u201d Though his personal style doesn\u2019t always align with that of professional athletes, Withrow said Hutt\u2019s clientele is an endorsement of her work. \n \n\u201cYou can certainly argue that most of these folks could afford to buy these clothes wherever they wanted to,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact they\u2019re working with her speaks highly of the way she works with clients and the quality of the clothing her company provides.\u201d \n Joe Amon, The Denver Post Paige Hutt, a Master Clothier and stylist with b.spoke.

He has pledged to boost economic growth to 4 percent a year and create 25 million jobs in the next decade as \u201cthe greatest jobs producer that God ever created.\u201d \n \nHe has promised to revive manufacturing, raise wages and make America great again. \n \nThose gains, he has said, would come especially in the states that helped catapult him to victory in November. \n  \n\u201cWe focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they\u2019re gonna have a lot of security,\u201d he said in a news conference earlier this month. \n \nRelated Articles January 28, 2017   The Latest: Source says foreign-born US residents can return   January 28, 2017   Iranian couple, Syrian mother and baby stopped at DIA as protesters rallied in main terminal against new policy   January 28, 2017   Trump order barring refugees, migrants from Muslim countries causes chaos, outrage   January 28, 2017   Trump, Putin discuss \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d trade, security   January 28, 2017   Protesters, immigration attorneys gather at DIA in protest of Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from Muslim countries   Voters in Rust Belt regions that have not shared as much in the nation\u2019s economic expansion will be looking in the coming years to see if Trump lives up to his promises. While Trump is sure to be judged on a wide range of economic metrics, here are a few metrics that will shed light on how he\u2019s doing in areas where he promised to deliver results. \n \nMonthly manufacturing job growth \n \nOne of Trump\u2019s biggest promises has been to restore the American manufacturing sector to its former glory. In his inaugural address, he vividly called out \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.\u201d \n \nEconomists caution that greatly increasing America\u2019s manufacturing jobs will be hard. Factory jobs have disappeared not just due to free trade and globalization, but also automation, which has allowed American factories to make more with fewer employees than ever before. In fact, although manufacturing employment has fallen sharply in past decades, American factories now produce more than ever before. \n \nThe bottom line: To meet his goal of reviving American manufacturing jobs, look for Trump to beat former President Barack Obama\u2019s record of adding roughly 10,000 new manufacturing jobs per month since the industry bottomed out after the financial crisis. \n \nJob growth in the Rust Belt and beyond \n \nTrump won the presidency in part because of his strength in the former industrial stronghold around the Great Lakes that is often called the Rust Belt. He won the swing states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa. He also flipped some counties that had voted for Obama in the previous two elections \u2014 perhaps because of his message of boosting the manufacturing sector resonated in areas that have seen good-paying manufacturing jobs disappear. \n \nThe bottom line: From 2010 to 2015, counties with greater than average manufacturing activity lost about 50 manufacturing jobs a year on average \u2014 a total of roughly 430,000 jobs. By comparison, the nation added just shy of 900,000 net manufacturing jobs over this period, suggesting that counties with a heavy manufacturing presence did worse than counties without one when it came to adding manufacturing jobs. Look to see if some of these counties start to add manufacturing jobs under Trump. (We\u2019ve excluded 2009 because of noisy data consisting of the collapse in jobs Obama inherited and then the effects of the stimulus and auto rescue leading to new jobs, and 2016 county-level data is not available yet.) \n \nThe employment-population ratio \n \nDuring the campaign, Trump criticized Obama for creating an economy in which too many workers were left on the sidelines. While the unemployment rate fell to low levels by the end of the Obama administration, Trump and many of his followers pointed out that measure didn\u2019t fully capture the economic problem. That\u2019s because the U.S. government only counts people as unemployed if they do not have a job and are actively looking for work. Those who have become so discouraged with the job market that they have given up looking for work are not counted among the unemployed. \n \nHowever, the U.S. government does produce data that capture this issue. One is the employment to population ratio for prime age workers, the percentage of the working-age population that is employed. While the ratio has improved a lot in the last few years, it remains stubbornly lower than before the recession. \n \nThe bottom line: Watch to see if Trump\u2019s economy can pull more potential workers off the sidelines and into the workforce \u2014 a failing for which he often criticized Obama. \n  \nUnemployment rates in the Rust Belt states \n \nTrump hasn\u2019t put much stock in the national unemployment rate before, but perhaps he will take a different attitude once his administration is in charge of it. That might be especially true for the regions known as the Rust Belt \u2014 especially the former manufacturing strongholds of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana, where voter support was instrumental in Trump\u2019s election. Compared with the national average, the unemployment rate in those five states has been elevated \u2014 though it fell to 5 percent, in line with the average for the other 45 states, in 2015. \n \nThe bottom line: Economists say unemployment rates this low will be hard to beat, but watch for them to stay stable or fall below 5 percent in Rust Belt states under Trump. If the rolls temporarily swell because more discouraged workers start looking for jobs again and are counted among the unemployed, that could be a good thing, too. \n \nWages for the white-male working class \n \nIn the 2016 election, Trump often pointed out that elites have done well in the economic recovery, but the average working class has lagged behind. His message about the loss of good-paying U.S. factory jobs seemed particularly tailored to white men, a group that he won by a wide margin. So one key sign of Trump delivering to his constituency in a way that could strengthen his case for re-election may be raising wages for white working-class men. While wages for white working men are already significantly above other working class demographic groups, they are far lower than white men with a college education. \n \nThe bottom line: During the last six years of the Obama administration, weekly median wages for white college-educated men grew by an average of $15 a year \u2014 outpacing white high-school educated men, whose wages grew by only $8.50 annually. Watch for Trump\u2019s economy to beat those gains. \n \nThe poverty level by race and ethnicity \n \nTrump gathered a substantial following among the white working class, but he tried to appeal to other demographics, too. His overtures to minority groups often came in the form of promises to fix what he described as crime-ridden and impoverished inner cities \u2014 though he has been criticized for conflating African-Americans with inner cities. \n \nThe bottom line: During the Obama years, the poverty rate fell fastest for Hispanics, shedding an average of 0.63 percentage points a year. Blacks also saw incremental gains, with the poverty rate falling by about a third of a percentage point per year. The improvement for white and Asians was smaller, however both these rates had way less far to fall. Look for Trump to improve on those measures. \n \nPercent of the population that is uninsured \n \nInsurance is also an economic issue; those left uninsured risk being faced with high medical bills that eat up savings and drive people into bankruptcy. The percent of the population that is uninsured fell across the U.S. in Obama\u2019s second term, as Obamacare required people to purchase insurance or face a penalty. \n \nTrump has expressed a desire in establishing \u201cinsurance for all,\u201d but the details of his plan remain unclear. On his first day in office, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to waive any part of the plan that puts a financial or regulatory burden on Americans, which likely includes the requirement to obtain insurance. \n \nThe bottom line: In states that voted for Trump, the uninsured fell from 13.5 percent of the population in 2013 to 9.8 percent of the population in 2015 \u2014 still higher than the national average. (In states that voted for Obama, the drop was from 10.4 percent in 2013 to 6.8 percent in 2015.) Watch to see if the uninsured population starts to spike again under a Trump presidency. \n \nU.S. trade deficit in goods with China and Mexico \n \nThe U.S. runs substantial trade deficits with both China and Mexico, huge manufacturing economies that make many of the finished products American consumers buy, and the inputs that U.S. factories use. Trump has often railed against this arrangement, saying that these countries are impoverishing and cheating U.S. workers. \u201cThe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address. \n \nDecreasing the U.S. trade deficit with these countries may be a tricky business. Trump has promised to boost the U.S. exporting industry and floated the idea of restrictions on imports, both of which could do the trick. But the U.S. dollar could also strengthen as a result of Trump\u2019s domestic policies \u2014 a change that would make U.S. goods seem relatively expensive compared to foreign goods, and could increase the trade deficit. And the trade deficit can change for other reasons, like fluctuations in international investment. \n \nStill, decreasing U.S. reliance on Chinese- and Mexican-made imports was one of Trump\u2019s major promises, so this will be an area to watch. \n \nThe bottom line: Though a lot of factors are in play, watch to see if the U.S. trade deficit with China and Mexico falls if Trump really lessens U.S. reliance on imported goods.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Is Trump keeping his economic promises?

He\u2019s worked at FirstBank his entire 35-year career, the last 17 years of which he served as chief executive officer of the bank\u2019s holding company. \n \nBy any number of measures, it\u2019s been a successful tenure. FirstBank has grown to become Colorado\u2019s second largest bank by deposits, behind only San Francisco-based Wells Fargo. Bank assets topped $17 billion in 2016, the 10th consecutive year of record profits for the privately held bank. \n \n\u201cEven through the financial crisis, we had record profits. It\u2019s really a pretty simple business model \u2014 we didn\u2019t do subprime loans. We stayed away from all the Wall Street-type shenanigans,\u201d Ikard said. \u201cPlus, being here in Colorado makes you look really smart. Banks just reflect their communities.\u201d \n \nOver the years, Ikard also transformed the bank\u2019s charitable giving efforts, and that commitment to the community has been a hallmark of his leadership, those who know him say. \n \nSince 2000, FirstBank has contributed more than $55 million to area nonprofit organizations \u2014 including more than $4 million in 2016. Before Ikard took over as CEO in 1999, the bank had donated roughly $5 million total over its previous 36 years, a bank spokeswoman said. \n \n\u201cHe really is the epitome of the hometown boy makes good,\u201d said Don Childears, CEO of the Colorado Bankers Association and a longtime friend. \n \n\u201cWe have a slogan here at CBA about banks helping Coloradans realize dreams. Every loan regardless of its purpose is a way to facilitate someone\u2019s dream. If it\u2019s a student loan, it\u2019s education. If it\u2019s a home loan, it\u2019s buying or remodeling a home. If it\u2019s a small business loan, it\u2019s the business you\u2019ve dreamed of starting for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cFirstBank has stuck with that model of lending and by doing that and looking at their community service, John has really helped a lot of Coloradans realize their dreams.\u201d \n \nIkard himself is quick to mention that FirstBank is the second largest corporate giver in Colorado \u2014 of all companies in all industries. \n \nSome people, he said, think the bank gives away too much, but in Ikard\u2019s mind, that\u2019s what makes it successful. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re only going to be as strong as our community. Ninety-five percent of our assets are in Colorado. If Colorado does well, we do well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit selfish, too. When we give and invest in our community, it makes for better bank customers.\u201d \n \nIt\u2019s not just money, either \u2014 Ikard has fostered a culture of volunteerism at FirstBank, himself a past chairman of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, Denver Area Boy Scout Council and Denver Economic Development Corporation. On a national level, he has served as chairman of the American Bankers Association, the nation\u2019s largest financial services association, and on the Federal Reserve Board of Kansas City. \n \n\u201cThe bank itself is a model of what it means to live and work in your community,\u201d said Kelly Brough, CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe don\u2019t just make our living here. We make our lives here.\u201d \n  \nOn a personal level, Brough said she will never forget Ikard\u2019s support after she was hired as the chamber\u2019s CEO in 2009. Some community members publicly questioned the decision, but Ikard took it upon himself to express \u201cunwavering confidence\u201d that she was able to do the job both to Brough and her critics. \n \n\u201cI needed some help to get my confidence back \u2014 he was there and helped me. He delivered the confidence I needed until I got my own back,\u201d Brough said. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible gift to give someone and John does that naturally. He is one of the most thoughtful leaders I\u2019ve ever had the benefit of being mentored by.\u201d \n \nWhether Ikard is talking to corporate CEOs or new hires, that personable nature shines through, said Jeff Plagge, CEO of Iowa-based Northwest Financial Corp. \n \nPlagge and Ikard served on the ABA board at the same time, often traveling to events and conventions to talk to bankers about the changes and challenges facing the industry at a time when it was \u201cknee-deep in the implementation of Dodd-Frank, \u201d he said. \n \n\u201cJohn just had this ability to reach out across all size aisles and have people listen to what he had to say,\u201d Plagge said. \u201cHis personality is such that he just attracts people to conversations that others sometimes wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \n \nUnder Ikard, FirstBank has earned respect up and down the industry ladder from small community banks to midsize regional banks to large money centers, Plagge said. A strength is the bank\u2019s commitment to growing talent from within. \n \nThat\u2019s apparent in the upcoming leadership transition. Ikard\u2019s successor, chief operating officer Jim Reuter, who officially takes the reins as CEO on Feb. 1, started his career at the bank in 1987. The incoming COO, Emily Robinson, joined FirstBank in 1993. \n Andy Colwell, Special to The Denver Post Longtime FirstBank CEO John Ikard poses for a portrait in his office at the bank\u2019s Lakewood headquarters. Ikard is set to retire at the end of January after 17 years leading the bank.  \n\u201cThey have one of the most interesting and successful cultures in banking,\u201d Plagge said. \u201cThat starts at the top. Whether John would take any credit, he has a lot to do with that.\u201d \n \nFirstBank employees are even allowed to give out Ikard\u2019s phone number to customers. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t get that many calls,\u201d Ikard said. \u201cA lot of times when someone calls you, they\u2019re just upset. Maybe you didn\u2019t approve a loan but they\u2019re not mad about that. They\u2019re mad because their business is failing or their wife has left them. You just let them blow off steam, treat them with respect.\u201d \n \nThe future of banking is all about technology, he said. Years ago, as many as 40,000 people a day came through FirstBank\u2019s lobbies. Today, it\u2019s maybe half that. \n \n\u201cBanks have become technology companies that deal with money. I have four kids \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t even know how to write a check. They use debit cards. They use online banking. They use mobile apps,\u201d Ikard said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not really good in that space, you\u2019re not going to be successful.\u201d \n \nWhat will the longtime banker do after his last day of work March 31? Ikard said he isn\u2019t sure, but it won\u2019t be retirement. \n \nFor one, he joked, his wife doesn\u2019t want him hanging around at home, interrupting her routine. \n \nHe serves as chairman of business advocacy group Colorado Concern  and will remain on FirstBank\u2019s board of directors. \n \n\u201cLucky to the organization he says yes to,\u201d Plagge said. \u201cHe\u2019ll go at that with the passion he\u2019s had throughout his career.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Emilie Rusch"},"topics":[{"name":"Denver-Aurora news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"After 17 years as FirstBank CEO, John Ikard leaves legacy of record profits, community giving","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Denver","zipCode":"80202","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Denver","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Denver Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661509","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"35315"},"name":"Denver Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.denverpost.com","publisher":"MediaNews Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.efirstbank.com/home.htm","http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp","http://www.coloradoconcern.com/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695198023060","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/firstbankceo_2ac3316.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

And teachers will also go to Singapore, Finland and Germany.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Healthcare management news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Delhi to be model state for healthcare, education: Deputy CM Sisodia","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ProKerala.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"261879685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ProKerala.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prokerala.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198036823","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. \n\nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. \n\n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail. \n\nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. \n\n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. \n\nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. \n\nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n\nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect. \n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Tait)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. states discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

You will be required to attend both days.  \nNo previous experience in volunteering or supporting people is needed as training is provided. \n \nThere is no upper age restriction and relevant travel expenses will be paid. \n \nOnce trained, Community Peer Mentors will work in pairs with individuals to find the reasons behind their behaviour or why they feel the way they do and encourage them to find ways to get the help and support they need. \n \nExisting volunteers within this unique project who have completed their training have found it a rewarding experience to help others when they need it the most. \n \nApplicants are invited to contact Jim Cunningham for more information or to register their interest on Tel: 0300 003 1818 or email: jim.cunningham@restorativehub.org.uk.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"LISTEN: Community Peer Mentor Project Seeking More County Durham Volunteers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Durham","zipCode":"DL3","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Darlington","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Star Radio North East","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"598896921","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Star Radio North East","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.starradionortheast.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198057318","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Logan Reporter","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907292","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Logan Reporter","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","RealEstate"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thereporter.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198058334","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There are several ways families can stay active throughout the year. \n \nThe group recommends the following workouts that can been done indoors: \n If it's too cold outside, try walking in the local mall.  Avoid the elevator and escalators, and opt for the stairs instead.  Walk the hallways of your office building during your lunch hour or a coffee break.  Start spring cleaning a bit early. Vacuuming, cleaning closets and washing windows can help you stay active indoors.  Rather than curling up on the sofa and watching a movie, follow an exercise video or DVD.   \nOutdoor winter fun can also burn calories. Bundle up, head outside and enjoy the following physical activities: \n Have a snowball fight.  Go ice skating.  Sled downhill and climb back up a few times.

China stands for concluding open, transparent and win-win regional free trade arrangements and opposes forming exclusive groups that are fragmented in nature,\" the Chinese President said. \n \nCasanova said that Japan has been particularly hard hit by the collapse of the TPP. \n \n\"Japan has a historical rivalry with China, so for Japan the TPP was very important and it feels it has been left alone. At the same time, let's not forget that China is already the most important trade partner for Japan, they already have a very close relationship in terms of trade, even if the rhetoric between them is aggressive at times.\"  \nIn the past, Mexico has seen China as an economic rival for the US import market. However, Casanova said a closer relationship between Mexico and China could be one consequence of Trump's decision to renegotiate the NAFTA trade deal, because Mexico is entering the negotiations from a weaker position than the US or Canada. \n\"Mexico of course is the weakest link of NAFTA, although for Mexico the US was the most important trade partner; as much as 80 percent of Mexican exports go to the US, so Mexico is left in a bit of a weak position.\" \n \n\"What is Mexico going to do? One thing, of course, is getting closer to China. (Although) Mexico was one of the last countries to approve the entry of China to the WTO because they saw the threat to Mexican exports of China's exports to the US. So from Latin America, Mexico was the country that probably had the most controversial stance against China. So, it would be a little bit odd if Mexico takes China's side.\" \n \n\"But, already they have started saying that if Mexico doesn't trade with its neighbor (the US) after the renegotiation of NAFTA, which would be the logical thing one way or the other, Mexico may turn to China,\" Casanova said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Trade news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Free Trade Leader: China Poised to 'Fill the Vacuum' After US Kills Off TPP","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RU","country":"Russia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sputnik","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665169","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sputnik","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://sputniknews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198065749","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A urine test on the spot revealed meth coursing through her veins. \n \n\"I thought I was going to be thrown in prison with all the men because I still have the title of Mr.,\" the transgender woman said. \"I was afraid. News and TV tells us that being sent to prison is scary.\" \n \nIt turned out not to be the ordeal she expected. The prison she was destined for \u2014 Pattaya Remand \u2014 separates lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender prisoners from other inmates, a little-known policy despite being in place nationwide since 1993, according to the Department of Corrections. Thailand, often described as a haven for gay people, has around 300,000 prisoners, of which more than 6,000 are registered as sexual minorities. \n \nAnd that's not all. The Thai government is also considering what could be the world's first prison facility exclusively for LGBT inmates. While the plans are still being discussed, in Pattaya and other prisons across Thailand LGBT prisoners are kept apart to prevent violence, officials say. \n \n\"If we didn't separate them, people could start fighting over partners to sleep with,\" said Pattaya Remand Warden Watcharavit Vachiralerphum. \"It could lead to rape, sexual assault, and the spread of disease.\" \n \nBy day, Pattaya LGBT inmates eat together and do their morning exercises in uniform. At night, they sleep in their own quarters, apart from the other inmates. \n \nBut most of the time, they mingle freely with the others, though they tend to stick together for daytime activities like sewing or football. Transgender women spike volleyballs next to men pressing barbells and sparing with punching bags; gay men train together in first-aid at the jail clinic, sanitizing and bandaging the wounds of straight men. \n \nMany LGBT inmates agree the limited separation is a decent compromise between safety and segregation. \n \n\"There are people that discriminate against gays,\" said Chawalit Chankiew, one of the gay clinic workers, sentenced to nine years for document forgery. \"If I happen to sleep next to someone who hates gay people, I wouldn't know it unless they show it. What if they hurt me one day?\" \n \nTheerayut says the prison's segregation makes her 1 ½-year sentence more bearable. \"If we behave like others, if we aren't stubborn and don't break rules, this place actually isn't so vicious,\" she said, sitting in a prison yard fenced with barbed wire, her long hair bobbing up and down as she spoke. \n \nBut the system isn't without problems. \n \n\"Transgender women who have not gone through gender reassignment surgery, they have to shave their head and live with the men, and there's going to be problems,\" says Wannapong Yodmuang, an LGBT advocate with the Rainbow Sky Association. \"Some of them are going to be OK living with the men, but there are some transgender women who might have a bad experience with men and won't want to live with them.\" \n \nThere are also concerns that the system does not adequately tend to the specialized health needs of transgender inmates. Hormone therapy, for example, is written off as a luxury by some. But LGBT advocates say it is essential. \n \nPlans for a separate facility for LGBT inmates on the outskirts of Bangkok could improve their treatment inside prison. The idea was first proposed as a measure to keep LGBT people safe, but it stalled over concern is that it would keep inmates far from their families. \n \n\"It'd be easier to control, easier to take care of, easier to develop and improve their habits and behavior,\" said Watcharawit. \"But they have to mix with other inmates because once they're released, they'll have to rejoin a diverse society.\" \n \nSome activists worry it could stigmatize them. \n \n\"Building and reallocating an entire prison facility for LGBT prisoners is as a matter of fact a measure of segregation,\" said Jean-Sebastian Blanc, an expert on prisons at the Switzerland-based Association for the Prevention of Torture. \"There is a significant difference between a public health policy aiming at preventing transmissible diseases and segregating a segment of the population on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\" \n \nSimilar proposals in Italy and Turkey have bogged down under heavy criticism. Italy announced it was rededicating a women's prison for transgender individuals in 2010, but the move was blocked by the Ministry of Justice over concerns that a special jail was a form of discrimination. Activists are attacking a proposed \"pink prison\" in Turkey over concerns that inmates there could face worse conditions than regular inmates because of anti-gay stigma. \n \nBut existing options leave much to be desired. In many prisons in the US and other countries, transgender women face a stark choice: get thrown into cells with men, or go into solitary confinement. \n \nChelsea Manning, the whistleblower arrested for sending secret military files to WikiLeaks, was sentenced in 2013 to 35 years at a male prison in Kansas despite declaring herself a transgender woman. She was thrown in solitary confinement for attempting suicide last year, and was granted clemency by former President Barack Obama.

He says in his letters the former PSL club was \"formed in 1906, incidentally exactly in the same year the ANC was conceptualised\". \n \nAs far back as 2015, Mlaba received queries from the Department of International Relations and Co-operation regarding his \"potential conflict of interest\" relating to the nondisclosure of his financial interests. Yet no action has been taken against him. \n \nQuestions have also been raised about Mlaba's security clearance, with sources in the department saying this week that he had failed his security vetting in 2013, shortly before he left to take up his post at South Africa House in London. \n \nMlaba said this week that there was nothing inappropriate about his deals, but two South African businessmen based in London said he was known for abusing his position for personal gain. \n \n\"The first time I went to his office to introduce myself, he told me his daughter has a waste management company and asked if I could help her. I then realised he was here to line his pockets and he wasn't representing South Africa, but himself,\" one said. \n \nThe other businessman claimed Mlaba wanted to use the embassy to launch his foundation and fundraise for his school project last year. \"He has asked me to solicit funds for his school on several occasions. He is running the embassy like his own spaza shop. \n \n\"Ambassador Mlaba was told he isn't supposed to use the embassy for his fundraising, and he started lobbying the South African Chamber of Commerce in the UK, of which he is a patron, to help him fundraise at their functions.\" \n \nMlaba finished his term as eThekwini mayor under a cloud. \n \nThe Manase inquiry implicated him in a multibillion-rand corrupt tender involving his family trust, revealing that he had tried to get a R3-billion contract awarded to a company linked to his two daughters and the Mlaba family trust. \n \nThe department was made aware that Mlaba had failed state security clearance last August. \n \n\"Any high commissioner who fails a state security clearance is a risk to our national security,\" said one source. \"It simply means he can easily be bought by foreign agencies as he has access to state secrets.\" \n \nMlaba's lawyer, Sarosh Zaiwalla, said in an e-mail there were no rules restricting Mlaba from engaging in any business so long as he had declared it to his department. \"The post of the high commissioner in the UK is in the hands of the president of South Africa. Our client was notified by the president of South Africa to take up the position as high commissioner. The president would have only appointed our client after investigating all required compliances. This is a matter between the president's office and state security and is therefore of no concern to our client.\" \n \nInternational relations spokesman Nelson Kgwete said: \"The issues of security clearance are matters between an employer and employee.

Yet, just as challenges have come to characterize the region\u2019s business landscape, so too have a wealth of technological advances that are rapidly changing the regional retail sector. What impact will these developments have in 2017? \n The power of customer data: Developments in digital commerce and underlying predictive customer analytics promise to deliver significant opportunities to a sector that is forecast to grow by 4.6 percent region-wide this year. If seized, this opportunity could not only offset the economic pressures that retail now faces, but take the sector to new heights. But there is a caveat: to realize this potential, retailers must learn how to successfully navigate the digital space and turn the deluge of public and customer data scattered across their different business units into tangible business results at their fingertips. \nHere, the target is to provide customers with a seamless, omnichannel shopping experience that will, in turn, create new revenue streams beyond the shop floor. The monstrous datasets that follow each of us around, like digital shadows, as we navigate our way through the online world, represent the single biggest opportunity for retailers to improve this seamless experience across channels. By leveraging the value of both internal (customer profiles, footfall, transactions) and external (customer social profile, traffic, weather, macro economic, and other) data, retailers can tailor their offering to drive sales, while at the same time optimizing their return on investment. \n \n Evolving customer expectations: The rise in the appetite for e-commerce signals a huge advancement in the world of retail and constitutes a massive growth opportunity for regional retailers. However, this also intensifies the pressure on retailers to revisit their approach of engaging with customers and adapting their business models to changing preferences in the region.  \nInternational players such as eBay and Amazon have created an expectation of excellent and instantaneous service when shopping online. Whereas once, shopping online might have been considered unconventional, perhaps even risky, investment driven by the big players in this field has raised standards to the point that it has become second nature to expect reliable, speedy service to rival the best physical retailers. \n \nIn addition to that, recent developments in the region have also set new benchmarks for online retailers. UAE businessman Mr. Mohamed Alabbar announced two new online ventures targeting the Middle East, including an AED 505.5 million joint venture with Italian luxury online retailer Yoox Net A Porter as well as e-commerce firm Noon. Dubai-based Al Tayer Group has also recently launched a new luxury retail e-commerce platform called Ounass. The company will deliver goods for free, within two hours for Dubai residents, on the same day for other emirates, and within 48 hours for other GCC residents. \n \nThe MENA e-commerce market is expected to grow to USD 7.5 billion by 2020 according to Euromonitor. While there is much opportunity, this will also be a time of intense competition and the need to differentiate through customer experience.   \n \nChange is the only constant: Retail customer preferences and habits are changing, both choice and competition are increasing, and ground breaking correlations are emerging. With these and other dynamic changes in the regional economic landscape on the horizon, each of these advances can be viewed as either an obstacle to success, or an exciting chance for growth\u2014and it is those who adopt the latter view who stand to gain.   \n \n-Ends- \n \nAbout Booz Allen Hamilton \nBooz Allen Hamilton has been at the forefront of strategy and technology for more than 100 years.

Say the \u201cwake word\u201d Alexa, give it directions and it will play music, give a weather report, order pizza, change your thermostat setting or dim your living room lights. Amazon introduced the roughly 9-inch tall cylindrical echo in 2014 and has produced smaller versions with more limited functions, the Amazon Tap ($129) and hockey puck-like echo dot ($49.99). \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \n\u201cPeople are buying them like crazy,\u201d said Kam Omidvar, a department manager at Lowe\u2019s on Alameda. \n \nStaff at Home Depot on Renaissance NE said they sold out supplies of the echo and echo dot over the holiday period and had the popular items on back-order. \n \n\u201cThis is the way of the future,\u201d said store manager Nick Herrera. \n \nMore affordable \n \nWhile retailers are seeing interest in home automation devices, Realtors say having them installed doesn\u2019t yet seem to play a role in home buying decisions. \n \nRealtor Missy Ashcraft with Keller Williams Realty said automation technology for home lighting and temperature control has been around for a few years, but the new devices make it more affordable. \n \n\u201cI think they are exciting and will be coming but they\u2019re not on the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind right now,\u201d said Don Martindell, president of the Greater Albuquerque Association of Realtors. \n \nScott Ashcraft of Las Ventanas Homes builds custom and semi-custom homes. He said most of his clients are interested in the security and energy-saving potential of home automation devices. Innovations in wireless technology mean he can install automation systems into a new home without having to run wiring through the walls. Martindell said this also means that a homeowner can easily retrofit an existing home with a system of their choice. \n \nSome concerns \n \nHowever, having a home dependent entirely on wireless technology can affect the performance of individual devices, said Shawn Mills, senior sales and design representative at Listen Up, which installs home automation systems. \n \n\u201cThe more devices you have, the more they will burden your wireless system and could cause things to work more slowly. It can demand more than your wireless network capable of delivering,\u201d Mills said. \n \nSecurity is also a concern. Researchers at Michigan State University found they could hack into the SmartThings system and open a home\u2019s front door, set off an alarm and change \u201cvacation mode\u201d light settings. \n NEST LABS: Palo Alto, Calif.-based Nest Labs makes a range of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats, smoke detectors and security cameras that work with Amazon\u2019s echo products and Google Home. \nNest, Honeywell and ecobee all make Wi-Fi enabled thermostats that cost around $250. \nDOING IT ALL: Google released its voice-activated speaker device Google Home in November for $129. Saying \u201cOK Google\u201d wakes up its Google Assistant who will play music, podcasts or radio from services like Google Play Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora and TuneIn. You can ask questions about the weather, traffic, finances and other topics. It will connect with the Google Chromecast to play TV programs and other smart devices to control home temperature and lighting. \nThe device is 5.62 inches tall, 3.79 inches in diameter and weighs about a pound. Its modular design allows you to customize the color scheme to match home décor. \nPHONE CONTROLLED: Samsung has the SmartThings home controller hub, which retails for around $64. You control the hub from your smart phone through a free app. It will connect with a range of wireless devices to control home temperature, lighting and entertainment. It\u2019s also marketed for home security features. The Smart Things Home Monitoring Kit, which retails for around $199 at big box stores, includes things like sensors that detect motion, water leaking or a door opening. You can add compatible locks, cameras and other devices to enhance the security features. \nAPPLE PIECES: Apple iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches now show the \u201cHome\u201d icon that allows you to control compatible thermostats, lights, window shades, locks and much more. \nBuying the devices to use with your controller system will add to the overall cost of the system. \nSECURITY ALERTS: Netgear\u2019s wireless Arlo security cameras, from about $190 each, can be controlled via a free app on smartphone or tablet devices. They send email or text alerts to the phone whenever motion is detected. \nLIGHTING OPTIONS: There are many different \u201csmart\u201d light bulbs on the market. Dutch lighting giant Phillips produces the Phillips Hue bulbs that can be adjusted to a range of colors to create the desired ambience in a home. A pack of three that includes the bridge to connect with the Wi-Fi network costs $199 at Home Depot; an individual Hue white and color-capable bulb costs $49. You can control it from your iPhone or Android with the free Phillips app. You can change the colors with the latest version of Amazon echo dot. \nCanada-based Sengled produces Bluetooth-capable light bulbs that double as speakers, starting at around $15 each. \nSPRINKLERS: The Rachio Smart Sprinkler controller will work with your sprinker system allowing you to control your watering wirelessly and get feedback on how much water you use. Price: $199 for an 8-zone controller.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Hot-selling smart home gadgets \u2018the way of the future\u2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87109","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Albuquerque Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660875","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3746"},"name":"Albuquerque Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abqjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198081030","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bayside and Northern Suburbs Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"258702582","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Bayside and Northern Suburbs Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.baysidestarnews.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198082238","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The home is a thatched dwelling at the southernmost part of the complex. \n \nZuma's close relatives also revealed that Dlamini-Zuma had become a regular visitor to Nkandla over the past two years. The couple divorced in 1998. \n \nThese revelations come amid expectations that Dlamini-Zuma will lock horns with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa for the top job at the ANC's elective conference in December. \n \nZuma is believed to prefer his former wife to succeed him over Ramaphosa. He gave credence to this view by saying, in SABC radio interviews recently, that it was not automatic ANC policy for a deputy to become president. He also praised Dlamini-Zuma for being a leader \"before she became a Zuma\". \n \nZuma's recent praise of Dlamini-Zuma contradicts his view of his former spouse in 2007 - when Zuma's group blocked her from being elected deputy president. The Zuma group chose Kgalema Motlanthe over her. In the lead-up to the Mangaung conference in 2012, at which Zuma was seeking a re-election, Dlamini-Zuma's name was raised by some branches as his possible successor. But Zuma recommended that she be deployed to the AU in Addis Ababa. \n \nNow it seems that the two have reconciled. Speculation is rife that the former foreign affairs minister could make a comeback to Zuma's cabinet, which she left in 2012 after her election to head the AU Commission. \n \nZuma's family members spoke fondly of Dlamini-Zuma this week, saying she had always been part of the family. \n \n\"Yes, she has a house that she uses in the complex and it's used by her and her children whenever they are around,\" said a close Zuma relative. \n  \nShe visits. In Zulu culture there's no divorce. Nothing happens here without her knowing. Even when we have functions she comes and she has a house \n  \nBut Dlamini-Zuma's spokesman, Vukani Lumumba Mthintso, denied that she has a house in Nkandla. \n \n\"But the chairperson lives in Addis Ababa, not in Nkandla,\" he said. \n \n\"You understand that she is divorced from the president, right? How can she also live in his Nkandla home? Even the other wives will never allow that,\" Mthintso said. \n \n\"You should be writing about the legacy she is leaving for Africa. Before her, there was no vision for Africa, but today there is 50% women representation at the AU. Let's write about what Africa has achieved. This is not going to help us. Think of it: Nkandla and Africa,\" said Mthintso. \n \nPresident Jacob Zuma and his ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are said to have reconciled after their divorce. Image: Supplied \n  \nHe refused to confirm whether his boss ever comes to Nkandla. \n \nBut a relative said Dlamini-Zuma was occupying a house initially allocated to the children of Zuma's deceased wife, Kate Mantsho - Duduzane and Duduzile. \n \nThe twins spend most of their time in Gauteng, seldom visiting Nkandla. \n \nSpeaking to the Sunday Times on condition of anonymity, an adult family member said: \"There is no divorce in our culture. She [Dlamini-Zuma] comes here often. This is her home and nothing happens here without her.\" \n \nDlamini-Zuma's house in the complex is adjacent to that of Nonkululeko Mhlongo, a Pietermaritzburg businesswoman and mother of two of Zuma's children. \n \nIt is also close to that of Zuma's youngest wife, Bongi Ngema. \n \nAnother family member said Zuma's former wife attended all family functions and gatherings. These included funerals, weddings and family and coming-of-age celebrations. \n \n\"The only event she did not attend was on the weekend of the 14th when Khulubuse [Zuma's nephew] was burying his fiancée in KwaMaphumulo, but the big four [wives Sizakele Khumalo, Nompumelelo Ntuli, Tobeka Madiba and Ngema] were there,\" he said. \n \nAnother relative said Dlamini-Zuma had hardly missed an event at Nkandla. \n \n\"Sometimes she arrives when the children are there, but last year she came several times and slept over a couple of times. She's often at home with everyone here,\" she said. \n \nThis was confirmed by another relative: \"She visits. In Zulu culture there's no divorce. Nothing happens here without her knowing. Even when we have functions she comes and she has a house. Here we still live by traditions. We still practise polygamy.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"NATHI OLIFANT"},"topics":[],"title":"News The Nkandla home where Nkosazana has spent a lot of time these past two years","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Times Live South Africa","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659031","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Times Live South Africa","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timeslive.co.za","publisher":"AVUSA, Inc"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198083462","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I was born in Iran and was raised in a conservative family and society. I went to university there and graduated with a master\u2019s degree in English language studies. I am now at university in Germany, but I am not able to make friends with girls. I have no proper job, no future and not even a friend. I tried online dating sites; they don\u2019t work. What is wrong with me? I even think of ending my life. I do not have any future going back to a country which does not accept me when I do not believe in Islam.\n\nMariella replies With loneliness it really doesn\u2019t help to know you\u2019re one of a huge majority, but I must tell you that you are. I could write responses to lonely people every week of the year if diversity of suffering wasn\u2019t a criterion in the agony business. If you can gauge society\u2019s woes on the basis of a column like this then the sense of isolation you articulate is at epidemic levels across the developed world. How interesting that that should be the price we pay for \"success\".\n\nIn your longer letter you describe the restrictions of your conservative family back in Tehran, which must have been tough to live with \u2013 but I bet you never felt \"alone\". Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not recommending you return and wallow in the misery of their control. Personal liberty comes at a price and the one we dwell on least is the responsibility it bestows on us for our own lives and the choices we make. Living in a less-fettered society has its drawbacks, and having to imagine our own destinies, rather than have them dictated by the edicts of societal expectations and religious diktats, is one of them. You\u2019ve already taken the brave step to change your destiny. This is no time to let your courage fail you So here you are having made a seismic move from one culture to another. It\u2019s hard to build your self-esteem when no one is looking and I sense quite strongly that what you are really struggling with is belief in yourself.\n\nYou\u2019ve come an immensely long way and as a result are feeling like an outsider in both cultures. Your lack of belief is a problem, I imagine, among the Iranian diaspora, and the mere fact that you are Iranian among Europeans. Yet you\u2019ve already taken a huge, brave and fundamental step in changing your destiny by making this geographical move.\n\nThis is no time to let your courage fail. You\u2019ve embraced your right to make up your own mind, to choose whether to follow your inherited religious practice or to embrace secular life. There is a price to pay for everything. I\u2019m not saying that the cost of your principles is to be eternally damned to an existence absent of friends and romance, but extracting yourself from the masses by carving an individual position puts you in a minority. If all this is contributing to suicidal thoughts then you must access professional help. In the UK the Samaritans do a great job.\n\nWhat\u2019s very important is to take responsibility and, more importantly, enormous pride in the strength it has taken to direct your own destiny. By choosing freedom and individualism you make life more daunting, perhaps because there is no prescribed path, but, let\u2019s face it, so much more exciting, too.\n\nYou don\u2019t say how long you\u2019ve been in Germany, but I sense not too long. It takes time to construct a new life and also courage and tenacity. The hardest choice you\u2019ve made is behind you and here you are with a blank slate ahead. How great. Who will you be? What will you do?\n\nI received a letter this week from a woman who took positive action to achieve her desired destiny on the basis of something I wrote. It gave me hope that my strong belief in our ability to change course, to make a determined effort to alter the status quo, is not ill-founded. She is now enjoying the lifestyle she desperately craved and all because she decided to make the changes required to bring her goals into reach.\n\nBeing true to yourself may make it harder to fit in, but it also gives you a lot more room to manoeuvre. University offers a multitude of extracurricular ways to meet people with similar interests, whether in politics or painting, sporting interests, books, dancing, or philosophy. You need to embrace anything and everything that\u2019s on offer until you find your feet.\n\nThe search for friends, and love, isn\u2019t something to be pursued in isolation but will happen naturally when you broaden your horizons instead of hunkering down in misery. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to try to be brave because you\u2019ve already proved you are. So far you\u2019ve acted on your principles; now you\u2019re ready to harvest the rewards when you accept that you are in the driving seat.\n\nIf you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11530","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Garden City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Garden City Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169679070","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Garden City Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gardencity.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695198103079","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Delaware Valley news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Middlesex","zipCode":"08816","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"East Brunswick","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"East Brunswick Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172182036","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"East Brunswick Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.eastbrunswick.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695198145401","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With the responses from the White House earlier in the week and George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d atop Amazon\u2019s best seller list almost six decades after it was first published, I figured I would give \u201cnewspeak\u201d and \u201cdoublespeak\u201d a whirl. My doctor looked at me the way I look at President Trump\u2019s counselor Kellyanne Conway. \n \nThough I would prefer the alternative fact that I\u2019m fit and thin be true, it is not. And that is apparent. I can see and those who know me can see the truth. To claim and insist otherwise when the truth is clear would be foolish. \n \nSo then, why would Trump and his parrots insist certain things are true when it is apparent they are not? In the face of facts \u2014 well documented non-partisan facts \u2014 why would you continue to promote and defend lies? \n \nConway used the Orwellian language on Meet the Press while defending White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s claim that Trump\u2019s inauguration attracted \u201cthe largest audience ever.\u201d Aerial photos and other methods of crowd calculation show previous inaugurations had greater attendance. The lower attendance was noted at Trump\u2019s event because it was apparent to anyone who looked at photo comparisons. \n \nIf team Trump had said nothing, it is likely that the report would have received little more than a mention in the course of inaugural events. But these people are determined to put petty on a pedestal. When asked, why not say something like: Trump\u2019s supporters are hard-working Americans many of who could not make the trip, but were with him in spirit. It acknowledges the lower attendance, while offering a positive and potentially truthful explanation. \n \nBoom. Honesty and ownership. \n \nThink this is small stuff? The next time your kid lies about grades, where he or she has been or the time they will return home, just shrug it off as an alternative fact. Got less of a raise than your boss promised? Don\u2019t get mad, just accept your alternative fact. Spouse or significant other messing around? Embrace the alternative facts. Neighbor stole your lawn equipment and you have proof on video surveillance? Better look again, alternative facts. \n \nBut they weren\u2019t done. Spicer also said of Trump: \u201cHe won overwhelmingly with 306 electoral votes, the most since any Republican since Reagan.\u201d \n \nThe actual, not alternative facts, were gathered by the Associated Press. \n \n\u201cNot the most since Reagan, and not an overwhelming victory by history\u2019s standards. You only have to go back to George H.W. Bush to find a bigger Republican Electoral College winner. Bush captured 426 electoral votes in 1988, or 79 percent, well ahead of Trump with 306 electoral votes, or 57 percent,\u201d the AP reported \u201cTrump actually ended up with 304 electoral votes because of the defection of two electors in December, but he had won enough states to get to 306.\u201d \n \nThe AP offered broader context: \u201cTrump\u2019s victory ranked 46th out of the 58 elections since the nation\u2019s founding, far from the \u2018landslide\u2019 that Trump himself has often claimed. Reagan achieved true blowouts, winning 489 electoral votes (91 percent) in 1980 and 525 (97.6 percent) in 1984.\u201d \n \nRonald Reagan\u2019s name should not roll off the lips of these people. There is no comparison. He was a true winner \u2014 a big one. He didn\u2019t build walls; he tore them down. He conducted himself as an honorable, decent man \u2014 worthy of our respect \u2026 landslide respect by today\u2019s low standards of acceptable conduct.

Winners were awarded for saving lives, quick and decisive thinking in challenging circumstances and coming up with innovative solutions for business. \n\nLeo Auga, supervisor Emirates Airport Services, received the Najm Chairman\u2019s Award for saving the lives of not one but two customers in the airport by putting his first aid training to good use. In both instances Auga was able to start CPR on customers who had collapsed in the airport. His efforts in those minutes until the arrival of paramedics were crucial to saving the lives of the customers. \n\nMark Fraser, service operator dnata at Perth, was able to avert a serious incident when a fire broke out under the conveyor of an arriving flight followed by a smaller fire in the engine compartment. With his quick thinking and decisive action Mark was able to put out both fires before they could risk the safety and lives of passengers onboard the flight. \n\nEdwin Jason John Emmanuel Sekar, Kassam Mohamedali Ayub Bakhrani, Mohamad Ayoub, Sandeep Sudhakaran Pillai and Niall Michael Kinirons from Emirates Engineering devised a new planning process to break down and estimate maintenance tasks on the Emirates fleet of aircraft. Once fully implemented in Emirates Base Heavy Maintenance, the new process was able to deliver significant savings in terms of man hours and attain an on-time delivery rate of 90 per cent. - TradeArabia News Service","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle Eastern business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Emirates recognises top employees","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"BH","country":"Bahrain"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"TTNOnline.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608026598","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"TTNOnline.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ttnonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198170290","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you decide you must protest, I have a suggestion: Go outside and clean up the mess left by last Sunday night's storm or pull a few weeds while you think about it. In four years you will have another chance at electing someone else. \n \nIn the meantime, Give President Trump a chance. You had your opportunity to vote just like everyone else. We have to make the best of the decision that was made. \n \nRealize that nothing in life always follows your prescription. How has that worked out for you? Admit it! You are not always right. Trump has not always been a winner which is witnessed by the fact that he is on his third marriage. But he has been proven pretty good at the thing he most wanted, making money and raising his children to be good at making money. If he puts his best effort into it, maybe he will be good at being president. \n \nDuring the last election cycle, many of Trump's worst character flaws were brought to light. In some instances he was portrayed as a womanizer, a racist, less than honest, lacking in compassion. Let us hope that with the help of good advisers, he will put these things aside and use his amazing ability to make money for the good of the country. We, the American people, have given him a chance to make good on his boast to \"Make America Great Again.\" If his idea of great and your idea of great do not coincide, you will have to wait and see how close he comes to your ideal. \n \nThose of you who gave up the idea of voting in the last election because the choice of candidates didn't appeal to you can only hope that you did the right thing. To me, doing nothing has never seemed to be helpful but when your choice is no choice, what can you do? We had plenty of chances to choose a better candidate but for reasons unknown, Donald Trump came out the winner even though he did not get the majority of the votes. When our founding fathers came up with the idea of the Electoral College they thought they had good reason for it. If you are confused by it, I suggest you study the history of that decision. It is too much for me to go into here. \n \nWhile we are deliberating on the right and wrong of this past election, let us hope that our worst fears will not be realized. Let us hope that President Trump will work as hard for this country as he did for his own prosperity. Let us hope that he loves his country as much as he loves his family. Let us hope and pray that his decisions do not lead us down paths that can not be subsequently resolved. He must eventually see that we are on a slippery slope when it comes to climate change, that human activity is affecting our planet on some scale or another. He, as our leader, must take this problem seriously and not give it a blanket denial. \n \nWhatever he is, President Trump is not a stupid man. There are shining examples all over this country of that fact in the many buildings he has built. In his words, he is \"very, very rich.\" \n \nAmerica is already on the path of recovery from our latest recession, but, as I am not an economist, I can only rely on what I see as an almost impossible challenge for our young families today who are struggling to stay solvent with the rising cost of paying a mortgage, paying for health care, raising their children and paying for child care even with two incomes. \n \nWill this president help change all that? At least he recognizes it and claims to be able to change it. Is this a challenge he can meet? I certainly hope so. Our young families are our hope for the future and their welfare is out country's welfare, their future our country's future. They must have the ability to stand on their own. We cannot ignore the part the environment has in their future, and we are seeing more and more evidence that we are failing to recognize that our energy challenges play a large part in what we are doing to that environment. \n \nPresident Trump, if I can speak to you personally, we need you to concentrate on all these problems, one at a time, and with your selected group of advisers, we need you to address them honestly and effectively. We need you to forget your ego and concentrate on the problems at hand for they are many and formidable. The American people have chosen you for good or ill. Please don't make them sorry for their choice. Don't let the nay sayers bother you. Go on and do what you were elected to do, Mr. President, and help us change the world. \n \nWhat can you as a good and caring and responsible citizen do to aid in our recovery? What can you do that does not require answers to our problems? Your responsibility is simple. You can first be a good citizen and work hard and honestly for the benefit of yourself and your family. Having done that, you can pray to our Creator for our new president that he will make good decisions, that he will ignore self-aggrandizement, a hostile press and angry protesters. Please pray often that all those in power will put aside selfish ambition and make the best decisions for all of us. That will do a whole lot more good than protest marches. \n \nNina Gilfert is a columnist for the Daily Commercial.

Like our sons, he lived on the computer. Unlike our sons, he wore saggy jeans and an oversized shirt. My husband, a retiree, took a a deep breath and kept quiet. \n \nOur guest\u2019s parents requested we help him get an American driver\u2019s license and save them the exorbitant fees for learning to drive in Europe. \n \n\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ve taught all my children to drive,\u201d my husband said. \n \nUnlike our sons, this teenager passed the written exam the first time and went straight to the empty school parking lot to learn the basics: shifting, turning, braking and parking. He relished the feel of the car\u2019s power and quickly learned to control it. They drove the quiet back roads before tackling small town traffic. \n \n\u201cI think you are ready to take the road test,\u201d my husband announced. The day the state examiner came to test new drivers, hubby went to school and picked up the teen. \n \nProspective drivers arrived at the parking lot in clean cars with their paperwork in hand. They knew the rules of the strict, older woman who gave the examines. \u201cIf the car is not clean, the examiner will not get in your car for the test drive.\u201d \n \nThe rest was standard: Sit up straight, check the rear view mirror when backing up and signal before turning. \n \nEasy. \n \nHe failed the road test. \n \nThe retiree and teenager came home disappointed and spent another week practicing turns, parking and backing up. \n \nOnce again my husband arranged for him to leave school early. Exiting our clean car, the confident teenager handed his paperwork to the state examiner. They drove around the block. \n \nAgain, she did not find his driving skills adequate to trust him alone on the roads. She would not pass him. \n \nIt did not make sense. The written test challenged everyone, not the road test. \n \nDuring a visit with my daughter and son-in-law, we talked about his failing the driving test. As we talked, I looked at my son-in-law who works in an office where he has to wear a neat polo shirt and khaki slacks every day. I thought about the examiner, the older woman verging on retirement. \n \n\u201cI think it is the clothes,\u201d I interrupted. \n \n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n \n\u201cI think his clothes are failing him. Can he borrow a pair of your slacks and a shirt?\u201d I asked looking at my son-in-law, a man of similar height and build. \n \n\u201cSure,\u201d he went to the bedroom and selected slacks, shirt and a belt. \n \nThe teenager looked at me strangely, but the next time the examiner was in town, he pulled on the borrowed outfit, looked in the mirror and said, \u201cI like these.\u201d \n \nHe drove my husband back to meet the parking lot where tests are given. Again, she accepted his paperwork, slid into the passenger seat and directed him to drive around the block. \n \nThey returned, parked in front of my waiting husband and both left the car grinning. He had passed. He could get a permanent license. \n \nAs she signed and stamped the papers, the examiner told my husband, \u201cI have never seen a driver improve so much in one week\u2019s time.\u201d \n \nTheir first stop was a department store, where the exchange student bought khakis and a polo shirt ­and told others the examiner\u2019s unspoken rule: dress professionally. \n \nA couple months later the exchange student returned to Germany with a driver\u2019s license and two important lessons learned: \u201cClothes make the man\u201d and \u201cfirst impressions do matter.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Joan Hershberger is a retired journalist who has written her award-winning, slice-of-life columns for more than a decade.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n \nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n \nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n \nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n \nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n \n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country?

The first kind is not achieving the intended result \u2014 say job training that leads to no jobs or a Marine recruiting campaign that gets few takers. The second kind is doing damage that wouldn\u2019t have been done otherwise. It\u2019s roughly the difference between a cigar that fails to light and one that explodes. \n \nThe immigration measures announced Wednesday by President Donald Trump fall in the latter category. The consequences will mostly be more or less the opposite of what he and his supporters imagine. \n \nHis promised wall is supposed to stop the flow of unauthorized immigrants and reduce the number of undocumented foreigners living here. But it\u2019s not likely to do either. \n \nStop the flow? Even if you assume smugglers won\u2019t find ways to breach the wall or tunnel below it, it will continue. On a typical day, more than a half-million people stream over the border from Mexico with the required documents. Some 40 percent of undocumented foreigners living in the United States came legally and overstayed their visas. \n \nPutting up a wall won\u2019t keep out people we knowingly admit \u2014 and it won\u2019t help find those who decline to leave. It will merely encourage more people to drive or fly in on a tourist visa rather than swim the Rio Grande. \n \nIf past measures to fortify the border shut some unauthorized foreigners out, they also kept millions of others in. Princeton sociologist Douglas Massey notes that in 1986, nearly half of the Mexicans here without permission eventually went back to Mexico, knowing that they could always change their minds. \n \nBut when enforcement was stepped up, they learned a lesson: Once you\u2019re here, you had better stay. The number choosing permanent residence rose. How\u2019s that for a solution? \n \nOne complaint about people sneaking over the border comes from ranchers whose lands they cross and befoul. But the migrants are there because of tight enforcement. \n \nIn the old days, they sneaked across in border cities. \u201cIt used to be that you could literally sit at a bar in Tijuana, Mexico, look across the border into San Diego, wait for the Border Patrol to drive in the other direction and make a run for it,\u201d Steve Atkiss, a former chief of staff of Customs and Border Protection, told The Washington Post in 2015. \n \nWhen security improved at major ports of entry, it pushed illicit migrants into areas with more rattlesnakes than people, which are harder to police. \n \nThat phenomenon would persist if the 653 miles of fencing now in place were extended, because filling in the other 1,300 miles would take years. In the meantime, landowners who have rarely, if ever, seen migrants before may play host to a steady procession of furtive skulkers. \n \nTrump also wants to punish sanctuary cities \u2014 whose policies bar police from making arrests for immigration violations or asking people about their immigration status. He decries these accommodations as a threat to public safety. In fact, they enhance it \u2014 by encouraging the 11 million undocumented foreigners living here to cooperate with cops. \n \nThe Major County Sheriffs\u2019 Association warned in 2015 that cutting off funds to these cities would \u201cprevent law enforcement from effectively protecting their communities and themselves.\u201d Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, told USA Today, \u201cIf people are afraid to come to the police, that domestic violence incident today will be a homicide tomorrow, and that\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d \n \nMost of what Trump says on this topic is lacking evidence. During his campaign, he accused undocumented immigrants of \u201ctaking our jobs.\u201d But if he expects tougher enforcement to create jobs and raise wages for American workers, he\u2019s in for a crushing disappointment. \n \nA report last year commissioned by the National Academy of Sciences detected \u201clittle evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers\u201d and found it has only a minimal impact on wages. \n \nA study by economists Gihoon Hong of Indiana University South Bend and John McLaren of the University of Virginia concluded that by raising demand for goods and services in the communities where they take up residence, new immigrants serve to create 1.2 new jobs each and boost the pay of Americans. Cutting down on illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t save jobs, on net; it would eliminate them. \n \nRight now, Trump is happy to brag about his crackdown. Will he still own it when it backfires? \n \nSteve Chapman blogs at http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n Lawsuit is first challenge to executive order  \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n Released under special circumstances  \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n 'The executive order is unlawful'  \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n Legality questioned  \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"DHS complies with judge to limit 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orange","zipCode":"32804","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Orlando","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Click Orlando","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"217"},"name":"Click Orlando","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.clickorlando.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198180690","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A happy mind is the secret of a good mark sheet,\" he added. Prime Minister Modi tried to encourage the students by saying that the examinations are test of this year's preparation and not of a lifetime. \n\n\"We sometimes do not see exams in the right perspective; Exams are not a benchmark of your success in life. \n\nIf your mission and ambition are in sync, marks will follow,\" he added. With concluding remarks, Prime Minister Modi urged the students to compete with themselves to see how they can improve their performance. \n\nSource","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"PM Modi spells \u2018smile more, score more\u2019 mantra for students","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"India4u.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169984930","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India4u.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india4u.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198180902","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n\nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n\nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n\nReleased under special circumstances \n\nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n\n'The executive order is unlawful' \n\nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n\nLegality questioned \n\nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n\nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n\n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n\n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"DHS complies with judge to limit 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"KTXS-TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"185753977","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"KTXS-TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ktxs.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198183052","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. NEWARK, NEW JERSEY\n\nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. Dozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. Dozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. A crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations.\n\nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday.\n\nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported.\n\nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said.\n\nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours.\n\nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" Protesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released.\n\nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition.\n\nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released.\n\nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said.\n\n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said.\n\nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke.\n\n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\"\n\nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come?\n\n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" About 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. A protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" About 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil.\n\nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. Hundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. As motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hopkins","zipCode":"42431","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Madisonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Madisonville Messenger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666772","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Madisonville Messenger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.the-messenger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695198186037","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/the-messenger.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/d9/1d9f6928-497c-55e4-b21e-fb1792cda625/588d9a830b8f0.image.jpg?resize=300%2C196"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/the-messenger.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/d9/1d9f6928-497c-55e4-b21e-fb1792cda625/588d9a830b8f0.image.jpg?resize=512%2C335"}],"video":[]}}

Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff in rest homes as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nelson Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744542","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Nelson Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198190761","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It explains that liposuction and liposculpture can be used to help hone patients bodies to the image they want. \n  \nBrooklyn, United States - January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \u2014 \n \nA Long Island liposuction, cosmetic, skin and laser surgery center has launched a new report on the benefits of liposuction and liposculpture as a way to gently reshape the body. Doctor Rokhsar, who runs the surgery, is at the forefront of research and teaching and lectures regularly on cosmetic procedures. His latest report focuses on how the service can be a way to remove unwanted fat stores safely and gently. \n \nMore information can be found at: http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction . \n \nThe site explains that, unlike many practices, the Long Island cosmetic surgery is not a one pony show. It boasts over 40 lasers and energy based devices in its world class centers in both Manhattan and Long Island. \n \nWhile some centers will seek to sell their services, patients at the New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center will never get a sales pitch. The center will give them a realistic expectation about the outcome of procedures they are contemplating, and from there they can make the best decision for themselves. \n \nDr Rokhsar is certified in dermatology and has completed additional training in cosmetic surgery fellowship. He explains that anyone considering liposuction in the New York area should be sure to ask their doctor if they are board certified in dermatology or plastic surgery. This is because a medical degree doesn\u2019t qualify doctors to practice in the field of lasers and cosmetic surgery. \n \nThe new report explains that liposculpture and liposuction remove excess fat from the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, waistline, arms, knees, ankles, calves, cheeks, jowls and neck. Liposculpture offers more precise sculpting through using smaller instruments for the process. \n \nThis works because it relies on tumescent fluid to numb the fat as well as to help liquefy it, allowing the doctor to remove it through small cannulas. It allows for fine sculpting of the body so local patients can better get the shape they desire. \n \nFull details of the Long Island liposuction services available at New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center can be found by visiting the URL above. \n \nContact Info: \nName: Chris Hayes \nOrganization: Virtual Heroics \nAddress: 2440 East 29th Street, Brooklyn, 11235 United States \n \nFor more information, please visit http://www.virtualheroics.com \n \nSource: PressCable \n \nRelease ID: 1652","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"New York metro area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Long Island Liposculpture New York Cosmetic Surgery Melt Fat Report Launched","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Marketers Media","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"600911997","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Marketers Media","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://marketersmedia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction","http://www.virtualheroics.com/"],"sequenceId":"695198192662","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The new service is a low moisture method of cleaning carpets that leaves them clean and quick drying. \n  \nJoplin, United States - January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \u2014 \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets, based in Joplin, have launched a new low moisture carpet cleaning service. This new service does not soak the carpets leaving them dry within the hour saving customers valuable time. \n \nFor more information please visit: http://carpetcleaningjoplin.net . \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets is owner operated and the owner, Alan Snider, will personally answer phone calls to ensure customer satisfaction. The website explains that they are the premier low moisture and upholstery cleaners for Joplin, Carthage, and the surrounding area in South West Missouri. \n \nModern carpets can hold up to a pound of dirt per square foot and this dirt consists of dust, allergens, pollen and other impurities. The site states that not only does cleaning carpets restore them to looking their best, it also helps to keep the home healthy and hygienic. \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets help homeowners to achieve carpet cleanliness by using a low moisture cleaning system rather than the traditional hot water extraction method. The hot water extraction method involves thoroughly soaking the carpet leaving it wet for hours, as well as trailing hoses through the home. With this method stains and spots often re-appear. \n \nThe low moisture method `uses patented technology to aggressively agitate the carpet without damaging the fibers meaning that less water is needed leaving carpets dry within an hour. Another benefit of using less water is that carpets are not soaked through and that means that stains do not wick back and re-appear. They use a machine that is self contained and does not trail hoses through customers houses bringing disruption to a minimum. \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets do not use soap and modern low moisture cleaning chemicals are 96% biodegradable, making it an earth friendly option. They also leave carpets with no sticky residue and are safe for children and pets. \n \nThe company also offers services that include upholstery and pet odor.

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff in rest homes as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dominion Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Dominion Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198203976","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n\nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n\nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n\nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\" Update your news preferences and get the latest news delivered to your inbox.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4802","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Whitsundays","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Whitsunday Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663563","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Whitsunday Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.whitsundaytimes.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198204765","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 14 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72904","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"4029 TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"195"},"name":"4029 TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.4029tv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198220098","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With that, they have brought art, music, food and holidays, which have melded into the culture of the region over time. \n   \nMoore said some ideas for the center, intended to attract tourists and educate visitors about Yakima\u2019s cultural history, include a museum that explains the Latino influence in the city or a mercado-like facility that actually drives economic activity. \n   \nCity economic development director Sean Hawkins said the organizations involved in the creation include the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Rural Community Development Resources Board and the city. They will have to work to define the scope of the project and what it could look like, he said. \n   \n\u201cThere\u2019s kind of some gray area around it. If you tell me what a business incubator looks like, I can visualize it, but I think people are all over the board with what this will look like,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cBut having the lead on this being the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and then seeing how the city and RCDR can work with this group, we can really develop a home place for Yakima\u2019s cultural history.\u201d \n   \nIn talking with residents, Coffey said, she has seen a lot of community support for including the center in the city\u2019s economic development plan. \n   \nThe council is expected to vote on a city economic development plan, which includes the multicultural center concept, at their Feb. 7 meeting.

Soft ride without the mushiness, responsive, outsole grip and durability No optional widths, minimal reflectivity, sluggish transitions, tongue slide, stiff lacing area  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \nEverything that has a beginning has an end. \n \nOver the past three years, the adidas Supernova Glide Boost had turned into somewhat of a running shoe legend. Its ride quality epitomized a perfect harmony between firm and soft; the upper fit had a decent amount of room for an adidas shoe, and runners simply couldn\u2019t stop singing the praises of its insanely durable outsole. \n \nThe Boost midsole also rewarded speed with responsive springback. The Glide 6 ~ 8 managed to blend everything good in just the right quantities, and it made perfect sense to name the last year\u2019s Glide  as the best running shoe of the year. \n \nAll good things must come to an end. With the Glide 9\u2019s introduction, the sun sets on a beloved product series \u2013 not in name, but rather in spirit. The new adidas Supernova has little in common with the outgoing Glide 8 . In fact, the new model shares more qualities with the Energy and the Ultra Boost than it does with the previous version. \n \nThe midsole and outsole have been entirely reworked. There\u2019s a substantial increase in the Boost foam volume, and other updates change the way how the midsole responds to weight loading. \n \nAll of these changes have only one goal \u2013 to make the ride far softer than the Glide 8. There are changes on its upper which influence the nature of the fit too, but the updates aren\u2019t as comprehensive as the ones applied to the sole unit. \n \nThere\u2019s some confusion about the shoe\u2019s name. It was initially released as the adidas Supernova, but now adidas\u2019s product page has added the Glide 9 suffix. The shoe box label still says Supernova M, and the same goes for various online retailers. In most likelihood, the new shoe will retain the popular Glide name and milk it for whatever it\u2019s worth. \n \nThough, it would have been far easier to write this review if the new shoe was just called Supernova. That way, we would have treated it as a brand new introduction and not stir up the ghosts of Glides past. \n \nThe Formotion based 2012 Supernova Glide 4 with its rearfoot-loaded softness. \n \nIn a way, the Glide 9 harks back to the pre-Boost era. The Formotion heel and EVA based Glides (V1 ~ V5) were softer than the V6 ~ V8, so there is some history with the ride softness. \n \nIf it wasn\u2019t abundantly clear already, we\u2019ll say it again. Forget what you know about the Glide 6, 7, and 8; treat the 2017 adidas Supernova as a brand new shoe. \n \nOne more thing; prepare your goodbyes for  the Sequence Boost too. The popular stability model is getting a makeover this year, with the Stableframe midsole heading towards retirement. \n \n\n    BRAND COMPARABLE 2016 MODELS CUSHIONING CHECK PRICE      adidas Energy Boost 3 Very soft Amazon    Asics Gel Nimbus 19 Medium soft Amazon    Brooks Glycerin 14 Medium soft Amazon    New Balance 1080 V7 Medium soft Amazon    Nike Vomero 12 Soft Amazon    Saucony Triumph ISO 3 Medium soft Amazon     \n \nThe new Glide has changed so much that it is now hard to compare it with similarly priced shoes like the Saucony Ride or the Nike Pegasus . The logical thing to do here is to move up in price, where the cushioning level of competing models become comparable. \n \nadidas\u2019s own Energy Boost 3 delivers a cushioning level similar to the Supernova. The upper fit is tighter than the Glide, but the midsole ride is the closest you can get right now \u2013 perhaps that will change once the Energy Boost 4 hits the market in 2017, but then that\u2019s a discussion to be had in the future. \n \nThe Brooks Glycerin 14 is a neutral trainer with a supportive feel, and it rides firmer than the Glide. The Nike Vomero 12 is somewhat comparable, as the Lunarlon+Zoom Air package delivers a cushioned and responsive ride. \n \nAsics has refreshed its Nimbus with a Dynaflyte-foam based midsole recently, and that makes the Nimbus 19 a firmer shoe than the Supernova. \n \nLastly, the Saucony Triumph is a reminder of the what the Glide 8 Boost felt like. With an Everun topsole and rearfoot core, the ISO 3 delivers a medium-soft ride which also feels responsive. \n DESIGN AND MATERIALS  \n\n \nThe Glide 9\u2019s upper design is a study in contrasts. The previous Glide 8\u2019s design approach was to spread the upper materials evenly; this was evident in the way how the fused synthetic was applied uniformly from the toe-bumper leading all the way up to the heel. \n \nBy using a combination of no-sew welding, subtle stitching and molding, the synthetic material was integrated well with the rest of the Glide 8\u2019s upper. \n \nThe 2017 Supernova treads down a different path. The forefoot is aesthetically cleaner as the external toe-bumper gets replaced with an internal toe-cap. The entire forefoot is now constructed using a soft and well-ventilated engineered mesh. \n \nThe same can\u2019t be said of the midfoot and heel design. The midfoot has semi-floating synthetic leather panels which are sewn at the midsole edge and the lacing eyestay; additional structure comes in the form of fused laminates on either side and over the lacing area. \n \nAnd the first row of lacing \u2013 which is closest to the forefoot \u2013 is based completely on a stack of welded laminates. \n \nThe heel uses a molded plastic clip which is split into a V-shape over the heel center. This design dispenses with the internal heel counter seen on the Glide 8. If you think about it, the upper appears to be partly inspired by the Ultra Boost ST. \n \nThe plastic heel clip is almost a direct lift from the ST , and the floating synthetic cage is somewhat similar too. \n \nMost adidas running shoes have made the transition to the lip-shaped heel collar. Even the previous Glide featured this design . The G-9 adopts a similar design but with a few twists of its own. \n \nThe heel lining has changed to a softer mesh with a nap-like texture. There\u2019s more foam padding packed within, and that is necessary to dull the effects of the plastic counter\u2019s pointy ends. \n \nBecause of the structural updates made to the heel, the Achilles dip is much softer than the previous Glide Boost models, and the molding is narrower as well. \n \nReflectivity gets downsized; replacing the G-8\u2019s panel is a small strip at the top of the heel. This is the only low-light visibility element you get on the new Glide. \n \n\n \nUnlike the Glide 8, there\u2019s no sleeve anchoring the tongue to the upper. Foam is used in liberal doses to make the tongue plump, but that\u2019s all there is to it. The synthetic suede strip over the flap is similar to the G-8, except that it is longer and features a tongue loop skewed at a strange angle. \n \nMost shoes with no inner sleeve use a loop to guide the laces and minimize sideways slide. The loop generally performs poorly when it comes to arresting tongue movement. \n \nBrooks and Mizuno seem to defy the norm because they use additional design features in addition to the loop. For example, Brooks uses a tongue-tied loop , and Mizuno relies on  a very wide flap  to restrict tongue movement. \n \nadidas\u2019s skewed loop doesn\u2019t work. The theory is sound, though. By making the loop crooked, the sliding movement should put pressure on the laces passing through, hence preventing slide though frictional resistance. \n \nIn the real world, however, the angle of the unsleeved tongue dips towards the outer side. This decreases the pressure on the laces, thus canceling the effect of the tongue loop. \n \nBesides, the loop is made of soft synthetic Nubuck. Even if the loop worked as intended, the friction would cause the soft loop to grow bigger over time. So this tweakery amounts to nothing as the Glide 9\u2019s tongue experiences a lot of sideways slide. \n \nNevertheless, adidas scores a brownie point for the loopy attempt. \n \n\n \nThe Glide 9\u2019s sole updates represent a no-holds-barred approach towards inducing ride softness. Everything on the new midsole and outsole is refashioned with the sole objective of making the shoe softer, and the final results align with the intent. \n \nWhere should we begin? The Boost midsole is a good place to start, we think. \n \nIt\u2019s hard to believe the Glide 9\u2019s rearfoot has more Boost volume than not just the Glide 8, but the Energy 3 Boost too. There is no firm EVA foam rim over the rearfoot; instead, there is a stack of unadulterated Boost. The plastic heel counter on the upper is directly attached to the Boost midsole in a manner similar to the Ultra Boost. \n \nThe EVA side rim exists, but only over the mid and forefoot. And the Glide 9 has another major update invisible from the outside. Below the insole, the lasting has changed to a fabric with lots of windows exposing the Boost foam beneath \u2013 again, something borrowed from the Ultra Boost.  This construction extends along the entire length of the midsole. \n \nThis update is a marked departure from the Glide 8\u2019s design which had a firm EVA layer between the foot and the Boost. Only the G-8\u2019s forefoot had two windows for easier access to the Boost midsole. \n \nEffectively, the EVA part on the G-9 is now confined only to the midsole edges, and the foot now resides in closer proximity to the Boost midsole. The removable insole hasn\u2019t changed, and it remains a thick, molded layer of EVA foam . \n \nThe new midsole isn\u2019t just about the newly acquired thickness, but also the extra width too. This becomes apparent when you look at the Supernova Glide 9\u2019s midsole. Both the forefoot and rearfoot outsole spreads wider than the previous model, which means that there\u2019s a corresponding increase in midsole width. \n \nMost recent adidas models have switched to the \u2018Stretchweb\u2019 outsole, and the new Glide does too. The outsole is a single-piece of Continental rubber molded in a lattice-like structure; multiple openings expose the Boost foam below while protecting it from the running surface. \n \nThe quality of traction is excellent; the Continental rubber grips equally well under dry and wet conditions. \n \nStretchweb makes the new Glide more flexible than the last year\u2019s version. The latticed outsole is easier to bend, and it is also helped by a softer midsole which limits the usage of firmer EVA foam. \n \nThe Torsion shank design is partially based on the Ultra and Energy Boost\u2019s design. The outsole center has a recess with a firm plastic seated inside, and the inner rearfoot has a plastic levee of sorts supporting the midsole. \n \nThe only difference here is that these appear to be two separate pieces of plastic. On the Energy and Ultra, the levee was a part of the midfoot shank. \n \n\n \nadidas\u2019s \u2018Stretchweb\u2019 design has come a long way since it was first introduced on the Ultra Boost. \n \nThe first version shredded like butter and was slippery too. The outsole has progressively improved over time, and the current version uses hard Continental rubber shaped in the form of flat lugs. While the durability doesn\u2019t match that of the older Glide Boosts, the Glide 9\u2019s outsole will outlast the competition. \n \nWe\u2019d like to point out that since the new outsole is a full-contact type, it does a better job at protecting the Boost foam above it. As a standalone material, Boost is extremely durable, with no loss in cushioning experience regardless of the mileage. \n \nHowever, the previous Glide had a rearfoot opening exposing the Boost foam , and this led to chunks of Boost getting ripped off after extended usage (>400 miles). With the new outsole, this will not prove to be an issue anymore. \n \nThe upper has a lot of structure except for the forefoot. Unlike the Glide 8, the new upper does not have fused layers on its side. This leaves the engineered mesh attached directly to the firmer midsole edge, something which makes us nervous. \n \nRepeated flexing over a few hundred miles could potentially lead to a weakening of the mesh \u2013 though we\u2019ll reserve our final opinion till the time we see negative reader feedback. \n UPPER FIT AND FEEL  \n\n \nThe Glide 9 has a high and broad toe-box because of the molded internal stiffener. In a way, the design feels similar to the Ultra Boost ST\u2019s toe-box which has ample space inside. \n \nCompared to the G-8, the midfoot feels a bit tighter, which is purely the doing of the sleeve-less tongue. You see, a thick and spongy mesh connected the G-8\u2019s tongue to the sides. Besides creating a smoother interior, it also insulated the foot from the outer upper. \n \nWith the sleeve gone, the floating panel bears down on the sides with slight pressure, and this is what you feel. adidas has tried to filter the midfoot pressure by placing fused laminates under the synthetic panel, but it isn\u2019t as effective as a thick inner sleeve. And tongue slide \u2013 that happens on the Glide 9. A lot. \n \nThe midfoot design needs time to break-in. We did say the upper was a study in contrasts, and here\u2019s proof. The midfoot is unnecessarily over-engineered; the lacing area not only has the thin laminate but thicker pieces of urethane welded over. There\u2019s one which forms the last two eyelets near the heel. \n \nThis thick part presses into the foot, which is at strange odds with the rest of the soft upper. This is a recurring problem with adidas shoes; even the Sequence 8 suffered from a similar issue . \n \nadidas just loves using a lot of plastic. It seems hypocritical that adidas markets shoes made of recycled ocean plastic waste  because adidas generates so much of it in the first place. No other brand uses so much plastic on their running shoes. \n \nThe heel wraps gently around the ankles. The new lining is soft and fibrous, and there\u2019s padding in plenty. The grip isn\u2019t as tenacious as some of the prior models, but the Glide 9 gets the job done. \n \nIf we had to nitpick, the pointy ends of the molded clip press down on the heel, a sensation which some people might find uncomfortable. \n \n\n \nOne would assume that a forefoot without overlays would result in more room, but surprisingly the Glide 9 feels narrower in the forefoot (not the toe-box) than the 8. A quick inspection of the design reveals the factors causing this. \n \nThe internal toe-bumper not only extends upwards but sideways as well. This partially reduces space on the sides. But what really makes a difference to the forefoot fit is the lacing, or rather its position over the forefoot. \n \nCompared to the Glide 8, the first row of lacing is located closer to the front of the shoe. This update leads to an increase in forefoot tightness, particularly around the top. The fit isn\u2019t tight to the point of discomfort but noticeable over the Glide 8. \n \nAlso, the hard urethane piece used on this lacing rows tends to bend in over the foot during flexing. So like the midfoot area, this area needs a break-in period. \n \nOn the other hand, the toe-box has a broad profile which leaves a satisfactory margin on the front and the sides. The Glide 9 fits true to size. \n RIDE QUALITY AND BEHAVIOR  \n\n \nCushioning softness is what the Glide 9 has in abundance. All the components \u2013 be it the thick and wide Boost midsole, the perforated fabric lasting, the chunky foam insole or the Stretchweb outsole \u2013 contribute to increasing the ride softness over the Glide 8. \n \nThe cushioning quality has evolved so much that the successive Glide Boost versions aren\u2019t even comparable. The 2017 Glide 9 is more like the Energy Boost 3 for $30 less. \n \nAll the extra softness does not make the Glide a bad shoe, but it certainly affects its versatility. The Glide 6, 7 and 8 were extremely versatile as they balanced cushioning with a touch of firmness. This made the older Glides useful for a variety of workouts. \n \nThe way we see it, the softer Supernova is now meant only for easy runs. Nobody is going to stop you if want to run fast, but when you begin clocking distance at a pace faster than 5 minutes per km or 8-minute miles, the soft midsole feels sappy. \n \nThe best use case for the updated Glide is that of a leisurely daily trainer or high mileage cruncher \u2013 all without worrying how fast or slow you\u2019re going. \n \nIt is important to know that the Glide 9\u2019s stated 10 mm heel offset should be taken as a mere suggestion and nothing more. A published heel-to-toe offset is very different from the dynamic offset, which happens when full bodyweight is applied on the midsole. The extent of the difference between the static and dynamic heel drop will depend on the softness of the midsole. \n \nOn a firmer shoe with little foam compression, the actual offset might be closer to the advertised heel drop. \n \nBecause of the Glide 9\u2019s soft midsole, the heel compresses a lot more than the 7 and 8. So there is a slight possibility that you might encounter mild soreness along the Achilles or Calf muscle. If you do, then just ignore it. Rest for a couple of days, and you should gradually get accustomed to the Glide 9\u2019s softer heel. \n \n\n \nConsidering the increased softness, the midsole doesn\u2019t feel as snappy as the earlier Glides. You\u2019ll experience a springy feeling which is inherent to the Boost foam, but the ride quality which rewarded higher running speed with increased bounce-back (responsiveness) is missing. \n \nThe ride feels one-dimensional and sterile. It\u2019s almost as if you can\u2019t tell the Boost apart from the rest of the midsole and outsole; you know what we mean? Everything is just soft, right from the windowed lasting down to the flexible outsole, and it is hard to isolate the Boost foam\u2019s uniqueness. \n \n\n \nIt\u2019s a given that a heel made almost entirely out of Boost is going to be less supportive than an EVA+Boost design. However, this fact wasn\u2019t lost on adidas, so they have introduced a couple of compensatory elements. \n \nIf you view the Glide 9\u2019s heel from the rear, you\u2019ll notice that the Boost midsoles grows progressively wider from top to bottom. The sidewall has two ridges which increase the width at two levels. This is meant to increase stability; in comparison, the Energy Boost 3 has only a single ridge. \n \nThe outsole footprint is wider than the earlier Glide too, a design element which aids stability. But a 100% Boost midsole cannot match the support levels of a firm EVA and a thinner Boost layer, so the Glide 9 has lower levels of support. There will be the sideways bias which comes with the compression of the soft Boost compound. \n \nWe\u2019d gotten used to the Glide 7 and 8\u2019s economic transition quality, a trait produced by the midsole\u2019s optimal mix of firm and soft. The Glide 9\u2019s transitions are a relative step-back. \n \nThe higher dose of softness makes weight transfers slightly laborious; you feel the foot sinking into the midsole instead of effortlessly gliding over it. The perforated lasting below the insole also contributes to the lazy loading sensation. \n PROS AND CONS  \n\n \nOne thing which Boost does extremely well is to deliver a soft, bouncy ride without the mushiness. This is inherent to the polyurethane material which the foam is made out of. The Glide 9 has lots of it and hence provides an extremely comfortable ride, especially when you\u2019re running longer. \n \nThe Continental rubber shines at delivering grip over all running surfaces, be it dry or wet. The material lasts longer than the industry average, which complements the durable Boost midsole. This makes all adidas Boost + Continental rubber shoes better value for money per mile. \n \nThe goodness of Boost and Continental aside, there are a few areas where the Glide 9 could perform better. \n \nRemoving the EVA rim and the fabric lasting robs the midsole of efficient transitions and responsiveness; considering that there are other soft adidas shoes such as the Energy and Ultra, why turn the Supernova into something similar? Because of the mentioned reasons, the midsole offers lower stability than the past Glide editions. \n \nadidas also needs to go easy on their upper design. The Glide 9, along with the Energy, has an over-engineered upper with an excess of structure. \n \nIn the Glide 9\u2019s case, the fused bits on the lacing panel adds unnecessary stiffness to an upper which otherwise feels soft and comfortable. Also, there\u2019s irony in the fact that such an over-structured upper design lacks adequate reflectivity. \n \nAnd yes, widths. For a shoe which fits snug, you need widths. Not want, but need. \n RECOMMENDED ROTATION  \n\n    ROTATION BRAND/MODEL SHOE TYPE CHECK PRICE      Same brand #1 adidas Glide 9 Soft ride, long and easy runs Amazon    Same brand #2 adidas Boston 6 Medium soft, all-around use Amazon    Same brand #3 adidas adios 3 Lightweight, faster runs Amazon    Multi brand #1 adidas Glide 9 Soft ride, long and easy runs Amazon    Multi brand #2 Saucony Triumph ISO 3 Medium soft, all-around use Amazon    Multi brand #3 Nike Streak 6 Lightweight, faster runs Amazon     \n \nAt the time of writing this review, the Boston 6 is the closest you\u2019ll get to the older Glide\u2019s firm ride. Except that the Boston is lighter, firmer and minimal \u2013 which makes it great for fast-paced running. It complements the softer Supernova Glide 9 very well. \n \nFor race-day, the adios 3 Boost is ideal. It is lightweight, breezy, and doesn\u2019t feel like running with wooden planks taped to your feet. \n \nThe Glide 9 isn\u2019t the Glide it once used to be. It moves up a segment higher in softness, so the firmer Saucony Ride 9 is a firmer alternative worth considering. For race-day use, the lightweight Nike Zoom Streak 6 performs well. \n SUMMARY  \n\n \nOh, boy. There are lots of changes over the Glide 8 worth summarizing. \n \nThe heel and forefoot cushioning is much softer due to the higher amount of Boost, the perforated lasting fabric, and the (relatively) pliable Stretchweb outsole. In terms of the upper fit, the toe-box gets higher and wider, but the forefoot feels narrower on the top due to the lacing moving closer to the front. \n \nEliminating the firm EVA layer of the Glide 8 dials down the supportive aspect of the G-9. For this reason, transitions also feel slower too. \n \nThe static heel-to-toe offset hasn\u2019t changed, but be aware that what you see isn\u2019t necessarily what you get. The softer Glide 9 produces a lower dynamic (when in use) heel offset compared to the Glide 8. \n \nYou\u2019ll see plenty of new materials on the upper. The forefoot has been updated to include an internal stiffener, and the midfoot gets floating synthetic panels while losing the inner sleeve. The heel collar receives a brand new lining material, along with an Ultra Boost inspired external counter. \n \nThere\u2019s no change in the retail price, and both the shoes weigh similar. But as you can see, both the Glide versions are very different from one another. \n \nAs they say, what\u2019s in a name? \n \nYou must be wondering which shoe should replace the Glide 8, since the V9 is such a different (and softer) shoe? Here are a few things you can do, besides hoarding all available pairs of the Glide 7 and 8. \n \nThe adidas Boston 6 is somewhat similar to the older Glide Boost, except for a firmer ride and a relatively utilitarian quality of upper fit. The Saucony Freedom is a close second, though pricier by $30. Its full-length Everun midsole has a firm ride reminiscent of the Glide and comes with a superb upper fit. \n \nBy paying $20 over the Glide 9, the Saucony Triumph ISO 3 delivers a ride experience which feels efficient, owing to the responsive Everun combined with a firm outer midsole. \n \nSo long, dear Glide 8 Boost. It was a privilege running with you. \n    This review is made possible by crowdsourcing multiple reviews from the solereview community. Improve it by submitting a review here .

Democrat attorneys general are expected to be a source of fierce resistance to Trump, much as Republican AGs opposed former President Barack Obama. A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals.\n\nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court.\n\n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail. The states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort.\n\n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro.\n\nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. However, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. states discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Times Live South Africa","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659031","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Times Live South Africa","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timeslive.co.za","publisher":"AVUSA, Inc"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://twitter.com/share","http://www.reddit.com/submit","http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/Sowetanlive/amplifierwidget;sz=631x126;ord=123456789?"],"sequenceId":"695198237616","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T09:36:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.timeslive.co.za/Feeds/Reuters_Images/2017/01/28/usa-trump-mattis-28-01-2017-00-01-10-282-.jpg/ALTERNATES/crop_80x80/USA-TRUMP-MATTIS-28-01-2017-00-01-10-282-.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.timeslive.co.za/Feeds/Reuters_Images/2017/01/28/usa-trump-mattis-28-01-2017-00-01-10-282-.jpg/ALTERNATES/crop_630x432/USA-TRUMP-MATTIS-28-01-2017-00-01-10-282-.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2580","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Goulburn","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Goulburn Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270460212","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Goulburn Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goulburnpost.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198238236","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2580","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Goulburn","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Goulburn Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270460212","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Goulburn Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goulburnpost.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198239990","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n\nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n\nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n\nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gladstone Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666668","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"14"},"name":"Gladstone Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198240156","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Ryan McMahon  (896 points, 39 ballots) \n \nCompared to the seasons that preceded it, 2016 was a down year for Ryan McMahon\u2014but I\u2019d say it\u2019s a stretch to call it a disaster, as many have. The 22-year-old lefty hitting corner infielder entered 2016 looking like an impact future major leaguer, as he had just posted a .300/.372/.520 line with 67 extra base hits (141 wRC+) in 556 plate appearances with High-A Modesto. McMahon\u2019s breakout 2015 combined with the scouting reports and draft pedigree led him to be listed on the top 100 lists of most of the national prospect writers, including a top 50 designation for Baseball America (43), MLB.com (48), and Baseball Prospectus (36). After 2016 those, accolades have disappeared. \n  \nMidseason Rank: 6 \n \nHigh Ballot: 3 \n \nMode Ballot: 8 \n \nFuture Value: 50, MLB regular \n \nContract Status: 2013 2nd round, Rule 5 eligible after 2017, three options remaining \n \nMLB ETA: 2018 \n  \nPlaying at the Double-A level against opposition that was on average 3.3 years older, McMahon finally found a level where he didn\u2019t mash. In 535 plate appearances for the Yard Goats, McMahon hit just .242/.325/.399 with 44 extra base hits. Notably though, after the All-Star Break McMahon appeared to have settled into the level a little, posting a .263/.347/.450 line in 171 at-bats with 18 extra base hits. McMahon's 30.1 percent strikeout rate is worrisome considering it was the fourth straight year it increased, but at least his 10.3 percent walk rate was acceptable. \n \nThe surface numbers for 2016 are much less impressive than his previous stats, but it's important to note that McMahon's line still equates to a 101 wRC+. That's very near league average and is not a bad sign for a young player. In fact, McMahon's 2016 was not too unlike the line produced by Nolan Arenado in Double-A Tulsa (110 wRC+) back in 2012 at the same age. Defensively, McMahon split his time about evenly at both first base and third base this year as he prepares for life in Arenado's shadow. While the field and arm tools still flash plus potential, McMahon committed 24 errors in 2016\u2014down from the 39 he had in 2015\u2014but still more than I'd like to see. \n \nFor more on McMahon, take a look at Bobby DeMuro's Spring Training profile of the young infielder. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nScouts have dropped McMahon out of their top 100 lists, but MLB.com has him sixth in their current list : \n  \nColorado still believes in [McMahon\u2019s] offensive upside because he has a smooth left-handed swing with bat speed and loft, generating power to all fields. McMahon has some feel for hitting and the patience to take walks, but he must make adjustments and cut down on his strikeouts. \n \nMcMahon has the tools to be an asset at the hot corner, but he is an erratic defender who has led his league in errors by a third baseman in each of the past two years, including 39 in 2015. A good athlete with solid arm strength and reliable hands, he gets into trouble with his footwork. \n  \nJohn Sickels of Minor League Ball had McMahon seventh in the system : \n  \nTough call here, left-handed power that made him so attractive is still here but contact problems were severe last year and defense has been disappointing, enough to move him to first base even without being blocked by Nolan Arenado; on the right day still shows an electric bat and he is young enough to make needed adjustments but parallels to Ian Stewart can\u2019t be ignored. \n  \nBaseball Prospectus dropped him down to 10th on their list: \n  \nThe Good: Despite a down year statistically, McMahon still has the same potential plus game power we\u2019ve raved about in year\u2019s past. The swing can get a little long at times, but there is enough bat speed and leverage here to drive balls to all fields. He can handle premium velocity, and the ball jumps off his bat wherever\u2014and this year whenever\u2014-he makes good contact. He\u2019s still a potentially above-average major-league third baseman, with soft hands, solid actions, and a plus arm. \n \nThe Bad: McMahon had a rough transition to Double-A. The length and uppercut in his swing got exposed against better stuff and sequencing in the Eastern League, and too often his adjustment was just to drop his shoulder and swing harder. The approach has always been aggressive and there was always a risk the hit tool was going to be fringy, but McMahon looked particularly vulnerable against stuff diving down and away. The transition to half-time first baseman is a work in progress and he looked a little awkward around the bag. It looked better in Fall Ball\u2014and he is athletic enough that he should be plus there in time\u2014but the bat might be truly stretched at first base. \n \nThe Risks: The risk profile is a lot higher than it was at this point last year. Double-A can be tough. If he ends up a first baseman due to team need\u2014though he is technically blocked there now too I guess\u2014the bat-to-ball skills will have to get a lot better. \n  \nFinally, Eric Longenhagen of FanGraphs was way down on McMahon , dropping him to 15th in the system: \n  \nScouts to whom I\u2019ve spoken regarding McMahon can\u2019t escape his tantalizing power. He has a gorgeous left-handed swing with natural loft and when McMahon connects he hits some of the prettiest home runs you\u2019ll see. These pyrite parabolas distract from swing-and-miss issues that, based on my Fall League looks, are potentially fatal to McMahon\u2019s prospectdom. McMahon\u2019s strikeout rate at Double-A this year was alarming, as was his drop in power production, and his woes have continued here in Arizona this fall. He doesn\u2019t track well and often fouls off punishable pitches in the middle of the zone. He has 60 raw power and, while the length in McMahon\u2019s swing makes it hard for him to get the bat head there consistently, if he catches anything down and in it\u2019s sent into orbit. He golfed out an inside slider during the Fall Stars game (his only home run of Fall League play). \n \nDefensively, McMahon\u2019s transition to first base outwardly seems like it\u2019s being made to find a spot for McMahon in a big-league lineup that includes the godlike Nolan Arenado , but most scouts think he\u2019ll end up there simply because he isn\u2019t very good at third. Proponents cite the heavy move to first base as the chief reason for the struggles at the plate. Others think the issues that plagued Double-A Hartford this year (they played all of their games on the road) had something to do with it. I just don\u2019t think McMahon is going to hit which, suffice to say, will make it hard to profile at first base. He could be a buy-low throw-in target for teams that still believe, because plenty of scouts still like this guy. \n  \nMcMahon\u2019s 2016 was a step back but not a disaster. I think that Arenado's presence will delay McMahon's major-league debut, but a need for another power bat could lead the Rockies to call him up as soon as midseason 2017. More likely it would be in 2018 after the Rockies have to add McMahon to the 40 man roster. \n \nWe all hope that McMahon's development path will adhere closely to Arenado's, but even if it doesn't McMahon is a potential every day major leaguer who will provide great power production. For that reason, McMahon was seventh on my PuRPs ballot and received a 50 Future Value as a MLB regular.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: MLB - Colorado Rockies news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: MLB news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: baseball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Colorado Rockies prospect Ryan McMahon had a disappointing but non-disastrous 2016","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yard Barker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"459817831","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yard Barker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Baseball"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.yardbarker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=mcmaho000rya","http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/130000/nolan-arenado","http://www.purplerow.com/2016/3/10/11170752/colorado-rockies-prospect-ryan-mcmahon-approach-big-league-spring-training-eye-opening","http://MLB.com/","http://m.mlb.com/prospects/2016?list=col","http://www.minorleagueball.com/2017/1/20/14336574/colorado-rockies-top-20-prospects-for-2017","http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/4387/ian-stewart","http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=31006","http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/top-24-prospects-colorado-rockies/","http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9777&position=3B","http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/colorado-rockies"],"sequenceId":"695198240601","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:00:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The original two-year $300,000 Gates grant wasn\u2019t renewed, and finding willing and qualified participants was tough at best, said county court consultant Herald Delia, who helped start the program in 2011. \n   \nOf the 234 juvenile cases considered for the program, a mere 28 were accepted. Of those, only eight completed the program and only two stayed out of trouble. \n   \n\u201cWhen we started, we thought \u2018Wow this is going to be something kids and parents are going to latch onto,\u2019 but they just didn\u2019t,\u201d Delia said. \u201cYou can bring them to the water but you can\u2019t force them to drink.\u201d \n   \nSeveral factors undermined participation in the yearlong court program, said Juvenile Court Administer Candi Shute. \n   \nQualifications to enter the program were narrow and the program required a significant commitment. \n   \nYouths entering the program must commit to several requirements, such as substance abuse treatment, family therapy intended to empower parents and community service, in exchange for having their charges deferred. \n   \nThey also have to check in with a probation officer daily and attend court weekly during the first several months of the program, requirements that taper off as they make progress. \n   \nThose allowed into the program typically face charges that would result in a month\u2019s detention and a year\u2019s probation, Shute said. \n   \n\u201cMost who would qualify for the program would rather sit the 30 days in detention and be through with the matter rather than undergo the yearlong program,\u201d she said. \n   \nAnd all parties involved, the youths, parents, a probation officer, prosecuting and defense attorneys have to agree to the court program. \n   \n\u201cAnd anyone can refuse,\u201d Shute said. \n   \nYouths who face or previously faced charges involving weapons aren\u2019t allowed into the court program, nor are those who are deeply entrenched in gangs, Shute said. \n   \n\u201cThe program is for those who are on the fringe of gang life,\u201d she said. \n   \nThe numbers have not been encouraging. Of the eight who graduated the program, six had offended again, Shute said. \n   \n\u201cThose eight kids did great things in the program \u2014 they did everything that was expected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened after they completed the program, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \n   \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the effort was a failure, she added. \n   \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a failure; I think it really opened people\u2019s minds to what you can do with kids,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you look at the numbers and it\u2019s not successful.\u201d \n   \nThe loss of the grant that funded intervention specialists \u2014 former gang members who moved on to more positive lives \u2014 was a crippling factor, Delia said. \n      \nEvery day Yakima Police officers respond to several hundred incidents. This app displays details of incidents handled by the Yakima Police Department over the last 30 days. \n SHOW MAP    \nYouths on the fringe of gang life need mentors who have been there, and made their way out, he said. \n   \n\u201cLosing them, that was significant,\u201d Delia said. \u201cWe hoped that the program would be looked at nationally and would receive long-term funding.\u201d \n   \nShutes said other priorities for Gates money bumped it. \n   \nNow, the juvenile court is looking at reshaping its approach to all youths and making the specialized services available in gang court to everyone, said Shute, who took the helm two years ago. \n   \nAt that time, she began probing the program and reasons it wasn\u2019t as successful as hoped. \n   \nShe found that many services being offered in gang court were already available in general court. \n   \n\u201cThere was a lot of overlap,\u201d she said. \n   \nOverall, the court will take a therapeutical approach to youths coming into the system, requiring family therapy, substance abuse treatment and other resources to help youths stray from crime and gangs. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to put our everything into a court that addresses what gang court did,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to move in a direction where we pick out all the good things we were doing (in gang court) and say \u2018why not make this available to all youth.\u2019 \u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Yakima County gang court fizzles after little success","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Kittitas","zipCode":"98922","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Cle Elum","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yakima Herald Republic","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169691285","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Yakima Herald Republic","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://yakima-herald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.yakimaherald.com/incidents/"],"sequenceId":"695198243626","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This is a guy who scored four goals in his NHL debut, and 23 times in a little more than half of his rookie season, and finally we have some evidence that a moment was big enough to shake him ever so gently. \n \nNHLPA on Twitter \n \n \n\u201cIt was a blast,\u201d he said. \n \nOf course, it\u2019s not every day that he\u2019s seated between Erik Karlsson and Shea Weber in the dressing room. When he glanced to his right in the visitor\u2019s room at Staples Center, he had Sidney Crosby playfully chirping him about their pending head-to-head matchup in the shooting accuracy competition. \n  \n \n \nThen they took the ice and Matthews briefly took the lead in the competition. \n \nCrosby was next up and bested him. \n \n\u201cHe made me look bad there,\u201d said Matthews. \u201cI was feeling really good, too. Four out of five (shots hit the target), not bad. \u2026 Then he goes four for five in like three seconds earlier. \n \n\u201cI guess that\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s got 26 goals this year.\u201d \n  \n \n \nThere\u2019s still a special buzz when you get all of the top players together under one roof. The NHL took it to another level this year by inviting the former greats honoured as part of their top-100 list \u2013 making it a who\u2019s who event for anyone who loves this game. \n \n[gamecard id=1714624 league=nhl date=2017-01-29] It\u2019ll be topped off on Sunday afternoon with the 3-on-3 tournament where players openly admit they\u2019ll only be going at about 80 per cent effort. \n \nAgain, that\u2019s basically beside the point. \n \nThis is about showcasing the skill of the athletes \u2013 the extra room on the ice certainly helps with this new format \u2013 and putting them in an environment to mix with their peers. There\u2019s still some value to having the future stars spend time with the established ones . \n \n[gamecard id=1714627 league=nhl date=2017-01-29] Crosby remembers attending his first All-Star Game in Dallas and walking into a dressing room that featured Brendan Shanahan and a bunch of other guys he grew up watching on TV. He listened a lot more than he talked that weekend. \n \nNow the 29-year-old is the one Matthews and Connor McDavid and Patrik Laine are looking at with some awe. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re having a lot of fun here and taking it all in,\u201d said Crosby. \u201cEarly on, you don\u2019t necessarily know all of the guys so you\u2019re really just trying to meet everybody. It\u2019s kind of a blur.\u201d \n  \n \n \nYears down the road it will be something to reflect on and tell stories about. It\u2019s one of the rare times in hockey where the outcome is completely secondary to the experience. \n \nThe All-Star Game is more about a celebration of the sport and honouring the guys who make it special than determining who is the best player or division at any particular moment. The winners will again have a $1-million incentive to split up on Sunday afternoon, but the rest of us will almost immediately forget who won. \n \nCanadiens Montréal on Twitter \n \n \nIt\u2019s still pretty cool to see what happens when you bring the best of the best together. \n \n\u201cHockey\u2019s a small world,\u201d said Crosby. \u201cEveryone kind of follows each other. \u2026 It\u2019s fun to see everyone just kind of interact. It\u2019s quick, though. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave here and we\u2019ll all be competing against each other in no time.\u201d \n \n[relatedlinks]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Johnston"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Best of the best make memories and magic at NHL All-Star Game","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"M4Y","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Downtown Toronto","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sportsnet.ca","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665898","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"730"},"name":"Sportsnet.ca","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["IceHockey","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sportsnet.ca"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/NHLPA/status/825516542209073153","https://twitter.com/CanadiensMTL/status/825511313594007554"],"sequenceId":"695198259447","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SN_ALL-STARS_COVER_IMAGE.png"}],"video":[]}}

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2013 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2013 were taken by the Indian President \u2026\u2026(deleted),\u201d it said. \nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv\u2019s mediation efforts to resolve \u201cthe conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo\u2026\u201d \nBesides Gandhi\u2019s possible assassination, the report also \nanalysed various scenarios of his \u201cabrupt departure\u201d from the political scene before 1989. \n\u201cAlthough we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv\u2019s tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\u201d it said while listing out several other possibilities including \u201chis death from natural causes or by accident\u201d. \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \u201cto resign out of frustration\u201d, saying \u201cwe see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\u201d. \nThe CIA report also noted: \u201cWe suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate \u2014 as we do \u2014 that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\u201d \nIn a section called \u201cImplications for the United States\u201d, the report says \u201cWe believe (Rajiv) Gandhi\u2019s death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\u201d \n\u201c\u2026We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv\u2019s assassination.\u201d \nThe report assessed Rajiv\u2019s policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\u201d among others, and their outcome. \n\u201cAlthough some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\u201d it said. \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \u201cnational government\u201d taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.

But they admitted that they found no evidence supporting the lurid allegations against Trump. Media outlets that investigated the claims also said they found no evidence that the alleged \u201cgolden shower\u201d video exists. \n \nBuzzFeed came under heavy criticism from its peers for publishing the dossier after admitting that the claims were unsubstantiated. \n \nIn a recent blog post, Christo Grocev, a Bulgarian expert in Russians security issues, claimed it was likely that Erovinkin was the source close to Sechin that Steele referred to in his report. \n \n\u201cInsiders have described Erovinkin to me alternately as \u2018Sechin\u2019s treasurer\u2019 and \u2018the go-between between Putin and Sechin,'\u201d Grocev wrote. \u201cOne thing that everyone seems to agree \u2014 both in public and private sources \u2014 is that Erovinkin was Sechin\u2019s closest associate.\u201d \n \n\u201cI have no doubt that at the time Erovinkin died, Putin had Steele\u2019s Trump dossier on his desk,\u201d Grocev continued. \u201cHe would \u2013 arguably \u2013 have known whether the alleged\u2026 story is based on fact or fiction.\u201d \n \n\u201c[Putin] had a motive to seek and find the mole.

According to some experts, it is unlikely that Putin would have ordered the assassination of a senior official in the circumstances and manner that rumors suggested. \n \n[Featured Image by Alexander Nemenov/AP Images] is an article from: The Inquisitr News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JohnThomas Didymus"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Former KGB Chief Oleg Erovinkin Who Allegedly Helped To Compile \u2018Golden Shower\u2019 Dossier On Donald Trump Found Dead","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Inquisitr","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676540","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"213"},"name":"Inquisitr","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.inquisitr.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/mystery-death-ex-kgb-chief-linked-mi6-spys-dossier-donald-trump/","https://t.co/MdWIow3kIB","https://twitter.com/hashtag/OlegErovinkin?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/kompromat?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/FSB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/MI6?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBD?src=hash","https://twitter.com/Anna_ohlala/status/825555482685235200","https://t.co/IpR0jc4V55","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheResistance?src=hash","https://twitter.com/noclosedminds/status/825428651072245760","https://twitter.com/hashtag/KGB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/chief?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/helped?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/spy?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/compile?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dossier?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dead?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lexus?src=hash","https://t.co/NGsN54fBdR","https://t.co/ytJiiF4GUt","https://twitter.com/zeusFanHouse/status/825418412130201601","https://t.co/gMODfeIBcP","https://twitter.com/thus_spake/status/825565522427252737","https://cgrozev.wordpress.com/author/christogrozev/","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:yIl2AUoC8zA","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:D7DqB2pKExk","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:gIN9vFwOqvQ","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:V_sGLiPBpWU","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:7Q72WNTAKBA","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:qj6IDK7rITs"],"sequenceId":"695198281725","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/President-Vladimir-Putin.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It said 17 of them alleged that the security forces, called Asayish, \"held them in stress positions, burned them with cigarettes, punched and kicked them, beat them with plastic pipes and cables, and shocked them with electricity.\" \n \nHuman Rights Watch researchers wrote that they saw visible marks on the bodies of five of the detainees. \n \nThe detainees said their treatment was meant to extract confessions. Most of the alleged abuse happened before they were transferred to Irbil's Reformatory for Women and Children. \n \n\"None knew the content of the confessions they confirmed with fingerprints -- some were illiterate or blindfolded, and others said that they were not allowed to read them and could not have because they were written in Kurdish,\" the report said. \n \nAll of the interviewed boys were Sunni Arabs except for one Kurd. Some of the interviewees said they had been forced to work for the Islamic State temporarily, while the others said were never in that position. \n \nDindar Zebari, head of the Kurdish Regional Government's committee that evaluates and responds to international reports, said in a letter to Human Rights Watch that torture and extrajudicial procedures are illegal under Kurdish law. \n \n\"Officers accused to be mistreating prisoners action will be taken to follow up on their misconduct in the court of law,\" he wrote in a Jan. 17 statement on his Twitter account. \n \nOn Thursday, an employee of the reformatory, who declined to give his name, said that only about 60 boys are being held in the facility at the moment. USA TODAY was barred access to the facility to confirm that figure. \n \nWhen families come out of areas controlled by Islamic State militants, their names are checked against a list of tens of thousands of suspected collaborators. The Kurdish and Iraqi governments keep their own lists. Both governments also rely on civilian informants to apprehend suspects. \n \nUSA TODAY spoke with a dozen Sunni Arab families in the Dibaga refugee camp, whose relatives have been taken by Asayish, including the mothers of two underage boys at the reformatory. \n \nMost families said the informants were neighbors with whom they had past disputes. \n \nOne mother said she was able to see her 16-year-old son but only with Asayish supervision so he could not speak to her freely. He told her he was doing fine but the other detainees she saw looked worse. She asked that her name not be used for fear of reprisals against her son. \n \nShe added that she also visited her brother-in-law at an Asayish facility for adults and saw restraint marks on his arms. He was haggard and skinny and looked like he had been tortured, she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Human Right Report Accuses Kurdish Forces of Child Torture in Iraq","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AINA","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169806014","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"AINA","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aina.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198283222","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Dress warm! Be ready for three days of fun, Friday evening through Sunday evening, in Our Town. Thanks to a great group of New Baltimore Lions Club volunteers working like crazy to put on a fantastic schedule of mostly outdoor events, there is something to intere\u2026\n\nLouis Tomlinson says there will be \"time\" for a One Direction reunion when the group has had a chance to \"explore their own solo things\" first.\n\nOn Feb. 18 and 19, families can enjoy a weekend of free fishing, courtesy of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources\u2019 annual free fishing weekend. \n\nPhoto courtesy of PIXABAYThe Michigan Department of Natural Resources waives fishing license fees two weekends per year, once in the winter and once in the summer.

On Feb. 18 and 19, families can enjoy a weekend of free fishing, courtesy of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources\u2019 annual free fishing weekend.\n\nDuring the Michigan DNR\u2019s free fishing weekend, fishing license fees will be waived for two days. Residents and out-of-state visitors may enjoy fishing on all waters for all species of fish, the DNR website states. All other fishing regulations still apply. No DNR recreation passport will be required.\n\nFree fishing weekends occur twice a year, once in the winter and once in the summer. The website states that Michigan offers some of the best freshwater fishing, with more than 3,000 miles of Great Lakes shoreline, more than 11,000 inland lakes and tens of thousands of miles of rivers and streams.\n\n\u201cFor many, the annual Free Fishing Weekend has become a tradition \u2014 a time to get together and have some fishing fun,\u201d the website states. \u201cWhile some may find time to reflect while fishing, there are no limits to variations on a great theme! Experienced anglers who offer a child or young adult the chance to take their first fishing trip can provide a rewarding experience for all.\u201d\n\nMany counties take advantage of this weekend, including Macomb County. On Feb. 18, the Macomb Sportsmen Society will host its fourth annual Youth Ice Fishing Derby at Lake St. Clair Metro Park, located at 31300 Metropolitan Parkway in Harrison Township. The event will take place from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.\n\nYouth of all ages and experience are invited. MSS will teach those interested how to ice fish, if needed. All bait and gear will be provided, or participants may bring their own. The cost is $5 per participant and includes lunch and hot chocolate. First through third place finishers will receive prizes in the two age divisions, which are 9 and under and 10 to 16. The derby is an outdoor event, so those attending should plan to dress accordingly.\n\nFor more information about this event, or to register, call 248-342-7778 or email George at georgepretty@yahoo.com.

Three years ago, a first \"innovation\" team report plumped for digital integration and chose subscriptions \u2013 paywalls rather than advertising free-for-alls \u2013 as the chosen survival route. Now \"Our Path Forward\" marches ambitiously down that road.\n\n\"We now have more than 1.5m digital-only subscriptions, up from 1m a year ago and from zero only six years ago. We also have more than 1m print subscriptions, and our readers are receiving a product better than it has ever been \u2026\"\n\nBut such success isn\u2019t enough, apparently. Transitions never go fast or far enough \u2013 unless of course they go too far, too fast. The danger down this trail is a relentlessly balanced tour of Cake-and-Eat-It territory. \"We need to reduce the dominant role that the print newspaper still plays in our organisation and rhythms, while making the print paper even better.\"\n\nBrothers and sisters, that\u2019s pure self-delusion. Print is a meal prepared to a set deadline, emerging from ovens at a magic moment. Digital is a constantly changing 24-hour buffet. Make print assemble its menu from that buffet and, inevitably, there\u2019s a weakening of focus. Not fatal perhaps, but not offering something \"even better\".\n\nAnd, indeed, the most interesting chunks of Times future shock come at the interstices where standard print wisdom needs radical rethinking. \"Our largely print-centric strategy, while highly successful, has kept us from building a sufficiently successful digital presence and attracting new audiences for our features content \u2026\n\n\"The Times\u2019s current features strategy dates to the creation of new sections in the 1970s. The driving force behind these sections, such as Living and Home, was a desire to attract advertising \u2026\n\n\"Today, we need a new strategy \u2026 Our approach has kept us from building as large a digital presence as the Times brand and journalistic quality make possible, and kept us from making our print sections as imaginative, modern and relevant for readers as they could possibly be. To be blunt, we have not yet been as ambitious or innovative as our predecessors were in the 1970s.\" All of which hovers on the brink of an essential point. Simply, in terms of range or ambition, the whole idea of a print newspaper (as honed four or five decades ago) may not be fit for purpose in an online world. Simply, the two concepts are different \u2013 one rooted in packages from the 70s, the other just one click away. Simply, editors may not be able to ride two horses together.\n\nLook around at the digital news initiatives that are making the weather in 2017. The Washington Post (prime competitor to the Times) is launching the Lily \u2013 a quite separate site of Post news re-edited for female millennial consumption, intentionally young, not old. The founders of Politico have just launched Axios, a site that gives you the news at pace (and added depth as required). And, of course, there\u2019s the massive Mail Online, which is nothing like the Mail on a newsstand. In short, you need an angle, a particular selling point: you don\u2019t need the full legacy treatment.\n\nA new report from the Reuters Institute on media upheavals in 2017 predicts more print papers will follow the Independent and go online only. But does the digital shade of the vanished print Indy demand that City writers follow business or football correspondents watch touchlines from Manchester to Southampton? Doesn\u2019t the drought of print advertising mean that sports pages \u2013 geared to young men \u2013 have lost their former pull? Such pages anyway barely exist in much of Europe, where defined sports dailies do the basic job: why not the same pattern online henceforth?\n\nIn New York Times terms, it doesn\u2019t matter if news sites, in the immediate future, don\u2019t offer every ancestral reader service. On the contrary, from the Lily to Axios, the name of the game is choosing news with a style and an audience: concentration. That doesn\u2019t mean that print New York Times, with its million subscribers, is dead and soon to be buried. Just the reverse. Separation plus concentration. The imperative is to reinvent digital subject areas and sites from scratch, not pretend that print\u2019s structure and subject choices still rules OK.\n\nMedia advertising needs \"new skills, talents, technologies and substantial fresh investment\", according to Mark Thompson, once BBC director general, now New York Times boss: a man to bring two worlds together. But as Thompson charts this future with its \"unified approach\" in his essay for Last Words, a comprehensive series of such examinations from Abramis published last week, does he ever think that equally different imperatives apply for the stuff that runs between the ads? The stuff we call news. \u2022","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Peter Preston"},"topics":[{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Newspaper publishing news","group":"Media"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Peter Preston on press and broadcasting You don\u2019t have to act like a newspaper on the net","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Media","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/media/digital-media","https://www.theguardian.com/media/series/peter-preston-on-press-and-broadcasting","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterpreston","https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/29/dont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios#img-1","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20act%20like%20a%20newspaper%20on%20the%20net&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios%3FCMP%3D","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20act%20like%20a%20newspaper%20on%20the%20net&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2020-report/","https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/29/dont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios#img-2","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&picture=https%","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20act%20like%20a%20newspaper%20on%20the%20net&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios%3FCMP%3D","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20act%20like%20a%20newspaper%20on%20the%20net&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-l","https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2017/01/18/the-washington-post-announces-the-lily/?utm_term=.6d7f45852589","https://www.axios.com/","http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/buzzfeed-trump-media-234197","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times","https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers","https://www.theguardian.com/media/us-press-publishing","https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post","https://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmedia%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdont-have-to-act-like-newspaper-on-net-new-york-times-lily-axios&type=article&internalpagecode=3132340","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5z3kg","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/media"],"sequenceId":"695198289504","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d8f507cc857f4413c1916ad5cf5af199c63b3ac/0_240_2201_1320/master/2201.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=0540f3f1882ad49b18ad30d30703cc70"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 14 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02494","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Needham Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCVB.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"352601084","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"415"},"name":"WCVB.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcvb.com","publisher":"Hearst Television, Inc."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198303575","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Officials from New Baltimore, Chesterfield Township, New Haven and Ira Township took part in the event, which took place Jan. 25 at Zuccaro Banquets and Catering in Chesterfield Township. Catherine Green, executive director of the chamber, said the group\u2019s first State of the Bay address was a success, with about 120 people attending. She said the chamber intends to host the event each year in late January.\n\nGuest speakers included Chesterfield Township Supervisor Daniel Acciavatti, New Baltimore Mayor John Dupray, New Haven President Pro Tem Kevin Chandler and Ira Township Supervisor Robert McCoy. Each took time to address various current events, business concerns and government issues.\n\nAcciavatti joined the Chesterfield Township Board after ousting incumbent Michael Lovelock from the supervisor\u2019s seat in the November election. Lovelock was arrested the following week by FBI agents as part of an ongoing federal investigation into public corruption. In his first couple of months at the helm, Acciavatti has led the board in adopting a budget for the 2017 fiscal year while also diving into the township\u2019s policies and procedures.\n\n\u201cMy 2016 in this position was very turbulent,\u201d he said at the address. \u201cWe came in in pretty rough times\u2026 My Chesterfield Township team has been very, very supportive as we go through this process.\u201d\n\nOfficials are now working to rebuild the township, starting with a foundation based on integrity and \u201cclear and transparent processes and procedures,\u201d the supervisor said. He outlined a handful of other focus areas:\n\n* Public safety: \u201cWithout safe streets we\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an amazing public safety team.\u201d\n\n* Public works: \u201cThere\u2019s no bigger highlight than the heavy civil infrastructure disaster in 15 Mile Road that\u2019s going on right now to provide those public utilities, not only clean water and sewer and cable and electricity, everything that falls under public works and lumps into transportation and being able to move goods and service effectively (and) safely.\u201d\n\n* Leisure services/culture and recreation: \u201cI\u2019m kind of appalled at the state of our sidewalks, our paths, how non-mobile our community is,\u201d Acciavatti said, also noting ground is expected to be broken at the Webber Paddle Park off of Jefferson Avenue this fall.\n\n* Investments and development: Acciavatti said \u201ca lot\u201d of new developments and investments are coming into the community. The new Cabela\u2019s outdoor merchandise store near Interstate 94 and M-59 is expected to be up and running by late spring or early summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all excited about that,\u201d the supervisor said to applause. \u201cThat whole development has got a whole lot of potential down the road.\u201d\n\n* Government efficiency: \u201cGeneral government being efficient, being transparent, being effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have so much potential,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity on not only the waterfront \u2014 how we can synergize with neighboring communities, with our friends in New Baltimore in Ira, village of New Haven up into Lenox \u2014 it\u2019s exciting that Ira Township, we\u2019re spanning county lines there, and there\u2019s a whole lot of common ground we have with St. Clair County.\u201d\n\nThe city of New Baltimore will mark its sesquicentennial, or 150th anniversary, this year. Plans are in the works to celebrate the milestone this summer.\n\nDuring the address, Dupray highlighted the city\u2019s recent growth while sharing potential plans for future development and some of the challenges the city is currently facing.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of exciting things planned; we really, really do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to get a lot better.\u201d\n\n* The city recently made an official offer to purchase Schmid Marina. If acquired, the site will continue to be operated as a marina, but as a self-sustaining public recreational area rather than private as it is now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited because this will be 17 acres of lakefront property with over a quarter-mile of shoreline that will be owned by the residents of New Baltimore,\u201d Dupray said.\n\n* \u201c(A developer) purchased a piece of property across form where the Dairy Queen is which had this ugly, terrible blighted building on it. This developer tore it down, built two restaurants, Burger King and Popeyes \u2014 a great addition.\u201d The former Christie Funeral Home site is also being renovated by a new developer.\n\n\u201cWait till you see it this summer; you\u2019re going to be impressed,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n* \u201cHarbor Oaks Hospital put on a new addition to help autistic children \u2014 a great thing.\u201d\n\nHe also mentioned a handful of challenges that lie ahead.\n\n* \u201cEvery city has challenges, and believe me, we have our challenges,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThe biggest challenge that I see is revenue sharing, the money that we get from the state\u2026 Every year since 2003 the state has given the cities less money.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur roads in our subdivisions are just deteriorating and people are really upset. We have a project now where we\u2019ll be able to plan to fix these roads. We can\u2019t fix them all at once, but we have to do this.\u201d\n\n* \u201cOur big, big problem is the non-funded health care liability that\u2019s hanging over our heads; everybody has that and we can\u2019t just ignore it,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to take care of that \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly how, but you have to keep plugging away and I\u2019m confident that somehow were going to solve this.\u201d\n\nChandler provided updates on recent happenings in the village and offered a look at what\u2019s ahead for the village this year.\n\n\u201cWhile we have a lot of work to do, we\u2019ve made some great strides and progress over the course of the past two years and we intend to continuously improve the village, look to forage collaborative relationships with our partners and build a strong community for our residents and businesses,\u201d he said.\n\n* \u201cIn 2016 we started a $1 million infrastructure project on our storm drain,\u201d Chandler said, referring to the construction on New Haven Road. \u201cThat was much needed, obviously, and it\u2019s coming along really, really well. We have a little bit to finish up on some side streets, but we had some great success in finishing that project.\u201d\n\n* \u201cWe started working with an accountant; we ended up hiring a firm out of Roseville and then actually hired an in-house accountant,\u201d he added, noting the village\u2019s 2014 audit has been completed and the 2015 audit is underway. \u201cWe had a little bit of an issue with some of our audits and things like that, but we\u2019ve really strived to keep that in progress, on time and in check, and so we\u2019ve actually put some really good initiatives together in order to make that happen.\u201d\n\n* \u201cWe adopted a balanced budget in 2016, increased our fund balance by cutting costs and moving to secure our water debt carry over. We had about a quarter-million dollars in water debt that was outstanding and we whittled that down to about $30,000.\u201d\n\n* Residents who are unable to attend village council meetings now have other ways to stay in the loop. Chandler said the village created a Facebook forum for residents and is working with NEMC Channel 6 in Armada to televise all meetings on the cable station and YouTube.\n\n* \u201cOne thing that we are really looking at is blight within the village,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at demolishing houses and putting a new violation process in place.\u201d\n\n* \u201cWe\u2019re going to streamline a permit process for those that want to build within the village of New Haven. We want to bring business to the village and we\u2019re certainly going to pursue commercial development, too,\u201d he said, noting it plays an important role to both the village and its residents.\n\nMcCoy shared updates involving various projects, developments and plans.\n\n* \u201cWe are quite a boating community and it seems like more and more marinas are being expanded, more and more boats are coming into Ira Township, which is really good \u2014 it\u2019s an excellent revenue for the businesspeople in the summer.\u201d\n\n* \u201cThe fire department was able to acquire a GPS that locates every fire hydrant in the township, McCoy said. \u201cSo whether it be stormy, rainy, snowy, as your approaching that hydrant there is a signal inside the fire truck that lets you know you\u2019re within 50 feet.\u201d\n\n* \u201cOur building permits have skyrocketed; they\u2019ve gone right off the charts, residential and commercial,\u201d he added.\n\n* \u201cWe\u2019ve had a tripling of the Rock Church on County Line Road. They\u2019re completing construction next month. I believe that\u2019s an asset to our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also have in place right now and almost nearing completion by spring is the Thunder Cats indoor soccer field (next to Anchor Bay High School). That\u2019s supposed to be a pretty big thing.\u201d\n\n* \u201cWe just approved a Dollar General store to the east of the Post Office in Fair Haven.\u201d\n\n* \u201c(Tin Fish on M-29) was dozed down and seven beautiful condo apartments have been put in there at a half-million dollars apiece. They\u2019re beautiful and they\u2019re really an asset to our community. We also have at the end of Long Island Court, better known to some of the locals as Vernier Point, 10 new condominiums going in there as well, which will really be an asset to the township.\u201d\n\n* \u201cNear the Macomb border, we have a new RV park that is just about completed with 30 units going in on the water, replacing an old small trailer park,\u201d McCoy said, adding that there has also been talk of a senior housing complex possibly being built on M-29 near the New Baltimore-Ira Township border.\n\nMcCoy also echoed Acciavatti\u2019s sentiments regarding integrity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my prayer, my hope, that all of us as leaders, businesspeople and residents, that integrity be at the top of our lists,\u201d he said.\n\nKatelyn Larese is the local news editor of The Voice.

Will it be a hit or a miss? \n \nWhat is it? \n \nThe two-year pilot scheme unveiled by former financial secretary John Tsang Chun-wah during his 2015 budget address encompasses 16 food trucks. The vehicles are permitted to operate in eight districts as the city seeks to round out the local tourism industry. \n \n\n \nTsang said the idea was inspired by a feel-good Hollywood movie about a frustrated restaurant cook who finds creative and business success with a food truck. \n \nHow were the food trucks chosen? \n \nA total of 192 applications were received, and 51 remained after the first stage of reviewing business proposals. The applicants later showcased their signature dishes at a cook-off challenge, and the top 16 contestants were selected by a panel of tourism industry practitioners, gastronomes, and city officials. \n \nWhere can they be found? \n \nThe food trucks are to operate on a rotating basis at eight locations popular with tourists: Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai; Salisbury Garden and Art Square at Tsim Sha Tsui; the Central harbourfront; Ocean Park; Hong Kong Disneyland, the Energising Kowloon East harbourfront; and the square next to Wong Tai Sin Temple. \n \nFood trucks coming to Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean park \u2014 and six other prime spots \n \nWhat they will be offering? \n \nA mixture of Chinese dishes, Western cuisines are on offer, with local delicacies dominating. \n \nFor example, there is soft pork bone with turnip rice, dried scallop with fish maw soup, and pineapple buns with fresh cream. \n \n\n \nAmong the Western options, there are BBQ pork burgers, Spanish grilled cheese sandwiches, and egg puffs. \n \nWhy is the scheme controversial? \n \nCritics said smaller players could balk at the cost as the government estimated a food truck project would require at least HK$600,000. This prompted officials to offer incentives to start-ups and small businesses to compete with larger rivals. In the end, seven of the 16 winners were smaller firms. \n \n\n \nThere was also criticism the government\u2019s red tape meant a lengthy process to win approval.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement.___NEWARK, NEW JERSEYMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry.___FAIRFAX, VIRGINIADozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia.___DENVERDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order.___CHICAGOA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations.Lawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday.Among those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported.Noorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said.The couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours.After Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\"__DALLASProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released.Among those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition.Bahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released.Hundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\"Immigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said.\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said.Hassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke.\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\"Honarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come?\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\"___SEATTLEAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29.___PORTLAND, OREGONA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\"___LOS ANGELESAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil.Avriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis.___SAN FRANCISCOHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations.___SAN DIEGOAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Allen","zipCode":"46802","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Wayne","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688454","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"179"},"name":"News Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-sentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198346684","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:34:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://assets.mediaspanonline.com/prod/13605466/Trump_Refugees_8786401292017_w150.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Now, more than 42 years on, Martin Schulz is presenting the fiercest opposition yet to Angela Merkel\u2019s attempts to win a fourth term as German chancellor. \n \nThe 61-year-old, who is returning to his homeland after 23 years in the European parliament \u2013 acting as its president since 2012 \u2013 is seen as offering the Social Democratic party (SPD) the best chance in years to reverse its fortunes, following a period of falling membership and poor electoral performances. \n \nSchulz on Sunday was expected to unveil his battle plan to challenge Merkel in Germany\u2019s general election in September, hoping a wave of popularity will help him shake up the race. \n \n\u201cI want to be chancellor,\u201d he told the news weekly Der Spiegel o n Saturday. \n \n\u201cI have worked with Angela Merkel longer than almost anyone outside her party,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cI have studied her, got to know her.\u201d \n \nAlthough his chances of ousting Merkel in September are slim, Schulz\u2019s challenge has been widely interpreted as a step towards undoing voter disenchantment and limiting the number of protest votes going to the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland. \n \n\n \nThe autodidact, conservative social democrat, who is proficient in six languages, offers the SPD an opportunity to emerge from the shadows of Merkel\u2019s conservative alliance, in which the party has served since 2013, more or less losing its identity in the process. It is still suffering from a dramatic drop in support, in punishment for widespread labour reforms brought in under former chancellor Gerhard Schröder. \n \nSchulz replaces Sigmar Gabriel, both as party leader and its main chancellorship contender, after Gabriel said earlier this week that he would stand down in the face of Schulz\u2019s popularity. \n \nHis main selling point is that he offers an alternative to Merkel, who is still popular but looks increasingly stale and has come under attack for her refugee policy . \n \nPolls published last week, which asked Germans who they would choose if they could vote directly for a chancellor, put Schulz and Merkel neck and neck at 41 per cent. \n \nHeribert Prantl, a leading political commentator for the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung , said in an editorial that Schulz\u2019s main challenge would be to \u201cshow he is more than just hot air. At the same time, the SPD as a party that bobs up and down in a permanent state of stagnation is one that will be grateful for any wind it can get.\u201d \n \nThe Bild newspaper said Schulz\u2019s strengths were Merkel\u2019s weaknesses, namely \u201cstrong, emotional performances and clear language\u201d. His main advantage is that he is untarnished on the Berlin political scene, having never been active there. \n \n\n \nSchulz\u2019s surprise entry into the domestic arena last week was the first news event for days to knock Donald Trump from the top of the headlines in Germany. \n \nThe politician, referred to as a \u201cman of the people\u201d, dropped out of high school and later, after his slump into depression, lost his job and narrowly escaped eviction. His brother, a doctor, is said to have rescued him from complete self-destruction. He has been teetotal since 1980. \n \nSchulz was born in the West Rhineland village of Hehlrath to civil servant parents, whose political allegiances were divided between the SPD and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He has been married for 30 years and has two grown-up children. \n \nBefore entering politics, Schulz trained as a bookseller and is known to be a voracious reader, with a penchant for historical biographies; he has cited the works of Eric Hobsbawm, John Steinbeck and Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa as among his favourites. \n \nHis political career began in 1987 when he became the mayor of Würselen, near Aachen, a post he held for 11 years. Since 1994 he has been a member of the European parliament, and head of the SPD MEPs since 2000. \n \nIn 2012 he was elected to the post of president of the European parliament, with 409 out of 612 votes. In the same year he received the Nobel peace prize on behalf of the EU. He has been a member of the SPD\u2019s executive committee since 1999. \n \nIn 2003, Schulz clashed with Silvio Berlusconi, criticising his domestic policy. In return, the then Italian prime minister said he would recommend Schulz to an Italian film producer looking to cast a concentration camp leader. \n \nSeven years later, Schulz had a run-in with the British Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, who interrupted a speech he was giving on the European stability pact by quoting the Nazi slogan \u201cOne people, one empire, one leader\u201d and calling Schulz an \u201cundemocratic fascist\u201d. \n \nDespite the buzz surrounding Schulz, political watchers say he can be happy if his party manages to win anything close to the 25.7 per cent it secured in 2013. Merkel\u2019s CDU is on course to secure about 33 per cent. \n \nAs many have been keen to point out, Schulz ran the European parliament in a similar grand coalition to that which currently exists in Berlin. Those hoping he will shake up the system in Germany might find he ends up participating in a similar model of governance. \n \nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Can 'man of the people' Martin Schulz oust Angela Merkel as German chancellor?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"HK","country":"Hong Kong"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"South China Morning Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685908","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"216"},"name":"South China Morning Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scmp.com","publisher":"South China Morning Post Publishers"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198354164","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/140x87/public/images/methode/2017/01/29/df996a74-e5f2-11e6-8801-9f557f980a64_image_hires.jpg?itok=d79w2XBl"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4370","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Warwick","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Warwick Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661425","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Warwick Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.warwickdailynews.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198355753","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A logjam at the top of the scoring race and competitive goaltending play has led to some intrigue as the season heads into the final weekend of January and into the stretch run. Here are the names worth watching in a considerably open Hobey campaign. \n \nFor Atlantic Hockey, Brady Ferguson (Robert Morris) is still the name to watch as he finds himself five points off the national lead, and in a sixth place tie in the NCAA. The goalies to watch remain Parker Gahagen of Army (1.77 GAA, .938 save percentage) and Francis Marotte (1.81, .943) of Robert Morris as both remain among the top seven statistical goalies in the nation. The trio all have a legitimate case to contend if they can continue to perform at a high level. \n \nOver in the Big Ten, Denis Smirnov (Penn State) has ceded the conference lead in points to Tyler Sheehy (Minnesota). With 32 points, he leads the conference and is in an 11 th place tie in the nation. No goalies stand out as Hobey contenders but Hayden Lavigne (Michigan) does rank in the top 10 in save percentage at .932. The Big Ten has standout teams this season, but no standout players for the Hobey. \n \nOn the flip side in the ECAC, many of the top contenders reside. Mike Vecchione and Spencer Foo (Union) are tied for the national point lead at 41. For goaltenders, Kyle Hayton ranks in the top 10 in save percentage at .933. Hayton represents quite the long-shot but Vecchione and Foo have as much of a chance as anyone to take home the Hobey. \n \nNow in Hockey East, both Zach Aston-Reese (Northeastern) and Tyler Kelleher (UNH) are tied with the aforementioned Foo and Vecchione at 41 points, that being the national lead. Dylan Sikura (Northeastern) sits right behind them at 38, fifth nationally, and Anders Bjork (Notre Dame) is right behind him at 35, good for a sixth place tie in the nation. Jake Oettinger of Boston University (1.70, .938) leads the conference for goaltenders, as he ranks just inside the top five in GAA and save percentage. \n \nIn the NCHC, Austin Ortega is not quite out of the race with 34 points, putting him in an eighth place tie nationally. At 31 points, Shane Gersich (North Dakota) ranks 13 th in the nation and second in the conference. Ben Blacker (Western Michigan) is beginning to impress (1.67, .939) although he still has not played in as many games as other goalies. Tanner Jaillet of Denver (1.91, .931) also impresses, but still finds himself out of the national Hobey race. \n \nAnd in the WCHA, the only forward over 30 points is Marc Michaelis (Minnesota State), a 14 th   place tie nationally, not exactly lighting college hockey on fire. The goalies are a different story however, as Angus Redmond (Michigan Tech) and Michael Bitzer (Bemidji State) lead the country in GAA at 1.50 and 1.59 respectively. Impressive numbers that definitely leave them within the chase for the Hobey, at least for now. \n \n  \n \n Zach Kaplan is a freshman majoring in broadcast journalism.

I knew it was going to be another tough fight and like I said, let's make it a third fight.\" \n \nSanta Cruz improved to 33-1 with one drawn while Frampton fell to 23-1. \n \nAlthough Frampton landed plenty of telling blows in a fight filled with frenetic exchanges, he was repeatedly pushed out of position by Santa Cruz's effective jab. \n \nAfter a strong 11th round, Santa Cruz withstood a desperate attack from Frampton in the final round. \n \n\"He was very clever. He used his reach,\" Frampton said. \"I think he deserved it. I'm being honest. I think he deserved it, but it was a very good fight. No excuses.\" \n \nGARCIA KOS ZLATICANIN \n \nOn the same card, American Mikey Garcia won his third world title with a ruthless third-round knockout of World Boxing Council lightweight champion Dejan Zlaticanin of Montenegro. \n \nA right upper-cut followed by a monstrous overhand right from Garcia knocked Zlaticanin out cold at 2:21 of the third round. \n \nGarcia's in-ring celebrations gradually turned to expressions of concern as medical personnel worked for several minutes to revive Zlaticanin, who endured his first defeat in 23 fights. \n \n\"I'm glad my opponent is OK. We never wish that anything bad happens in the sport,\" said Garcia, a former featherweight and super featherweight titlist who improved to 36-0 with 30 knockouts. \n \nGarcia had used an effective jab to control the bout from the first round. \n \n\"I think it was a great performance,\" he said. \"I fought smart. I kept the distance, I controlled the range. The left hand was key to keep him at that distance that best suited me and follow through with that right hand. We were able to connect, hurt him and put the end to the night.\" \n \nA third scheduled world title fight on the card between International Boxing Federation featherweight world champion Lee Selby of Wales and former world champion Jonathan Victor Barros was cancelled apparently because of Barros health issues. \n \nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission said it declined to issue Barros a license and ESPN reported he had tested positive for hepatitis. \n \nSelby, who had said in the build-up to the bout that his dream was to fight in Las Vegas, was gutted at the weigh-in on Friday. \n \n\"I'm almost in tears,\" he said. \"But I'm too dehydrated to cry.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: boxing news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Santa Cruz claims WBA belt","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperSport.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"611212512","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"SuperSport.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Boxing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://supercricket.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198364532","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They centered on a few hands, summed up in one message I received via Facebook.\n\n\u201cCan you provide expected return on hitting as opposed to standing on 12 vs. dealer 2 or 3 and standing on 9-9 as opposed to splitting vs. dealer 7? Those always made me squeamish.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve touched on these hands before, but let\u2019s use the blackjack hand calculator at wizardofodds.com for a by-the-numbers look to ease the squeamishness over doing what must be done. We\u2019ll assume a six-deck game in which the dealer hits soft 17 \u2013 the most common situation in American casinos.\n\nWhen you have hard 12 against a dealer\u2019s 2 or 3, you\u2019re in a less than ideal situation. You can bust with a one-card hit; the dealer can\u2019t. If you don\u2019t hit, you can\u2019t make 17 or better, while the dealer will make a standing hand nearly 65% of the time with a 2 up and more than 62% with 3 up.\n\nLet\u2019s look at 12 vs. 2 first. Assuming your 12 is 10-2, then vs. you lose 28.9 cents per dollar wagered by standing or 25.2 cents by hitting. Other compositions vary slightly: Your average loss is 25.6 cents with 9-3, and 25.4 cents with either 8-4 or 7-5.\n\nWith 12 vs. 3, it's closer. You lose 24.9 cents per dollar wagered by standing. As with 12 vs. 2, you lose less when you hit, but here the range is so narrow we need to go to an extra decimal to compare different hand compositions. Average losses per $1 wagered are 23.16 cents with 10-2, 23.73 with 9-3, 23.33 with 8-4 and 23.22 with 7-5.\n\nCard counters sometimes will make the opposite play. If the true count in a Hi-Lo count is plus-2 \u2013 meaning two more low cards than high cards per deck already have been played \u2013 it\u2019s better to stand on 12 vs. 3. If the true count reaches plus-3, it\u2019s better to stand on 12 vs. 2.\n\nBut non-counters don\u2019t know the composition of the remaining deck. More often than not, the best play is to hit 12 vs. either 2 or 3, so that\u2019s the play basic strategy tells us to make.\n\nAs for standing on a pair of 9s when the dealer has a 7 face up, you have a leg up because the dealer will have a 10 value face down 30.7% of the time. On those hands, your 18 beats the dealer\u2019s 17.\n\nIt\u2019s a strong position for the player, and if you stand your average profit is 39.96 cents per $1 wagered.\n\nPlayers are tempted to split the 9s and try for a double profit. But 9 is not a strong a start as 18. On 46.2% of hands, you\u2019ll draw a 2 through 9 that leaves you needing another draw, and if you draw another 9 to get back to 18, you face the stand/split decision again.\n\nYou\u2019ll wind up with enough weak hands that splitting the pair actually decreases your profit to 36.42 cents per $1 of your original wager.\n\nBy splitting, you double your risk but slightly decrease your profit. That\u2019s why the basic strategy chart says to stand on 9-9 vs. 7.\n\nLook for John Grochowski on Facebook (http://tinyurl.com/7lzdt44) and Twitter (@GrochowskiJ). \n\nThis article is provided by the Frank Scoblete Network.

Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., has asked the new U.S. Secretary of Defense to exempt civilian employees of the Crane Army Ammunition Activity from a federal hiring freeze enacted by President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Saturday, Donnelly sent a letter to newly confirmed Secretary of Defense James Mattis inquiring whether the freeze would affect an estimated 130 Department of Defense civilians currently under contract at Crane.\n\n\u201cAs you work with your staff to implement the president\u2019s order for a federal civilian employee hiring freeze, I am writing to bring (to) your attention the potential unintended consequences this order may have on the Army\u2019s organic industrial base and specifically my constituents working at Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CRAA) in Indiana,\u201d Donnelly\u2019s letter reads.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed a presidential memorandum instituting a federal hiring freeze for a period of 90 days. Donnelly wrote that many Department of Defense civilian workers are term employees, meaning their contracts at Crane need to be renewed. Donnelly cited reports that an estimated 130 members of the Army Ammunition Activity workforce will have their terms expire and be up for renewal during the 90-day hiring freeze.\n\nIn the letter, Donnelly noted that \u201cat (Crane), hundreds of Hoosiers work alongside thousands of other Department of Defense civilians nationwide to provide America\u2019s fighting forces with safe, reliable and lethal munitions they need to accomplish their missions and come home safely.\u201d Donnelly further noted that roughly 25 percent of the conventional munitions in the U.S. military inventory pass through Crane.\n\n\u201cI am concerned at the uncertainty this has injected into CAAA\u2019s mission and the lives and livelihoods of the Hoosiers who work there,\u201d Donnelly wrote.\n\nThe presidential memo, Politico reported earlier this week, has many loopholes in it. All military personnel are exempted, which makes up more than a third of total government employment. It also exempts jobs deemed \u201cnecessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities,\u201d without specifying what they are, according to Politico.\n\nIt is unclear if the 130 jobs noted by Donnelly fall into one of those loopholes. Multiple attempts to contact Crane\u2019s public affairs officer were not immediately returned Saturday afternoon.\n\nDonnelly\u2019s letter, while brief at just more than a page in length, spoke directly to Mattis\u2019 directive to keep the country safe.\n\n\u201cGiven the critical role that CAAA plays in support of ongoing operations, including the fight against ISIS, I hope you will have the authority under the president\u2019s order to exempt these (Department of Defense) civilian personnel from the hiring freeze based on their vital role in meeting the Departments\u2019 national security responsibilities,\u201d he wrote.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jonathan Streetman"},"topics":[],"title":"Donnelly requests exemption for Crane civilian workers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"46151","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Martinsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665162","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporter-times.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198382855","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/00/c007bc1e-e5e9-11e6-a3e5-37adb851f8d9/588d879866d61.image.jpg?resize=200%2C297"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/00/c007bc1e-e5e9-11e6-a3e5-37adb851f8d9/588d879866d61.image.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The second punch floored the Belarusian, allowing the France resident to pound away with punches from on top while Arlovski turtle up. The end came just 92 seconds into the fight.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: MMA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"UFC on Fox 23 Highlight Video: Watch Francis Ngannou Lift Andrei...","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sherdog","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"600287257","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"79"},"name":"Sherdog","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","MartialArts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sherdog.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198383105","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She was originally scheduled to headline last year\u2019s festival but had to pull out due to an illness. \n \nInitially founded as \u201cthe Newport Jazz Festival at Saratoga\u201d the weekend event was renamed Freihofer\u2019s Saratoga Jazz Festival in 1998. \n \nThe 2017 Freihofer\u2019s Saratoga Jazz Festival features a major lineup of musicians, ranging from emerging artists making their festival debuts, to the return of two legendary musicians who performed on the inaugural 1978 festival, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Jean Luc-Ponty. \n \n \nThis year also marks the centennial of the first recorded jazz album and the first commercial use of the word \u201cjazz,\u201d when the Original Dixieland Jazz Band recorded their New Orleans rooted music at Victor Talking Machine. The recording was an instantaneous success, ushering in a new era of popular music, the \u201cJazz Age.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe 2017 40th anniversary Freihofer\u2019s Saratoga Jazz Festival will be an extraordinary tribute to the history of our festival and to the future of jazz music,\u201d said SPAC President and CEO Elizabeth Sobol. \u201cFor four decades our festival has played a critical role as an incubator of the up-and-coming stars of tomorrow. Artists like Dee Dee Bridgewater, Jean-Luc Ponty and Jack DeJohnette established Saratoga\u2019s premier place amongst the great American jazz festivals. Likewise, today\u2019s young artists Cory Henry, Jacob Collier, and Cécile McLorin Salvant are the future of jazz. Forty years from now, we will look back with a sense of the great fortune we have to experience their current work on the magnificent SPAC stage.\u201d \n \nDanny Melnick, the festival producer and president of Absolutely Live Entertainment, said the festival \u201ccontinues to be in a powerful position to honor the musicians who\u2019ve given us the rich legacy of jazz heritage, and to present a new and diverse generation of artists and visionaries who embody a community that\u2019s both a life force for new ideas and social change.\u201d \n \nBelow is a look at who will be performing where during the two-day festival \n Saturday Main Stage  \n\u2022 Khan, a ten-time Grammy Award winner best known for hits \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t Nobody,\u201d returns to SPAC for the first time in 20 years.

Alabama improved to 13-7 overall, 6-2 in SEC play. The victory gave the Tide a season sweep of the Bulldogs, who fell to 13-7, 4-4 in the league. \n \nKey, who scored 19 points, has now led Alabama in scoring in its past three games and continues to display the confidence of a much older player. Just before the made 3-pointer, he missed a jumper, but Jimmie Taylor got the offensive rebound and sent it out front to Dazon Ingram. \n \n\u201cI just saw an opening in the corner so I just decided to sprint there,\u201d Key said. \u201cI was wide open, took a dribble and just shot it. We work on that every day in practice.\u201d \n \nCrimson Tide coach Avery Johnson obviously was pleased that shot blunted Mississippi State\u2019s charge that took the Bulldogs from 52-41 down to 58-57 ahead. \n \nHe was just as pleased the freshman looked to take the shot, especially after missing earlier in the possession. \n \n\u201cBraxton had the confidence to take and make a big shot,\u201d Johnson beamed. \u201cHe\u2019s a different player than he was early in the year. Since he\u2019s been starting at the two position the last two games, he\u2019s settled in. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s able to use his size against some of the smaller players. He passes the ball. Had a couple careless turnovers early in the game, but he\u2019s a player we want to continue to encourage because we need him to be productive on both ends of the floor.\u201d \n \nThis wasn\u2019t a typical Alabama basketball victory. The Crimson Tide shot an impressive 31-for-36 from the free-throw line \u2013 easily its best performance of the season. Ingram, whose struggles at the line even drew some light-hearted shade from Key, was a perfect 12-for-12 at the charity stripe. \n \n\u201cCoach Avery told me to step up the line with confidence and know that I\u2019m going to hit the free throw,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cWe practice it a lot.\u201d \n \n\u201cLike Riley (Norris) said a couple weeks ago, as you see your teammates in a game making free throws, it\u2019s contagious. Dazon shot really well tonight and got us all going,\u201d Key said, a sly smile spreading across his face. \u201cHe was shooting pretty bad from the free-throw line. If he can make a free throw, we all can make a free throw.\u201d \n \nAlabama players made a lot of them. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to build confidence,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c\u2026 We totally changed Dazon\u2019s (pre-shot) routine. He\u2019s using his legs more, he\u2019s much more confident. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just as proud of Donta (Hall, 4-for-4) and Corban (Collins, 2-for-2), guys that have struggled from the line. Hopefully, this will build some confidence. This lets us know what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d \n \nAlabama was outshot from the field by Mississippi State (23-for-56 to 17-for-52), and even outrebounded by the Bulldogs 40-37. The difference at the foul line, where State was 11-for-19, was huge. \n \nSo was the turnover count in the second half. Alabama turned it over just four times to State\u2019s 13 after halftime. \n \nIngram was only 1-for-9 from the field but finished with 15 points. Norris added 13 points, 10 in the first half. Bola Olaniyan grabbed 11 rebounds and Key had nine boards for Alabama. \n \nNorris heated up late in the first half, helping Alabama go on a 10-2 run over the last 2:51 for a 34-29 halftime lead. \n \nThe Crimson Tide opened it up to 41-29 in the first three minutes of the second half. \n \nJohnson winced as he described Alabama being too loose with the ball during a sequence when his team had a big lead. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re up 10 or 12 and get a 2-on-1 break \u2013 and then we go into our Harlem Globetrotters routine,\u201d Johnson said. \n \nAlabama opened the door and State charged back. Consecutive 3-pointers by Lamar Peters, who led the Bulldogs with 13 points, and Quindarry Weatherspoon, who finished with 11, put them ahead 58-57. \n \nMississippi State\u2019s Schnider Herard finished with 12 points. \n \n\u201cI thought we did a great job defending them on their first shot, but they got to the line too much,\u201d MSU coach Ben Howland said. \u201cWe had too many turnovers. Credit them. They attacked the basket and did a good job getting to the line. It\u2019s a tough one because we were right there.\u201d \n \nAlabama plays at Arkansas on Wednesday (6 p.m., SEC Network) before returning home and playing Auburn next Saturday night (7:30 p.m., SEC Network).","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ken Rogers krogers@dothaneagle.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Late Key basket helps Tide surge over Mississippi State","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lee","zipCode":"36803","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Opelika","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Opelika-Auburn News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169713540","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Opelika-Auburn News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oanow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198384872","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:35:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/oanow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/3f/b3f94b25-ab7b-5552-a4b0-21b94020f25a/588d8f8eb046f.image.jpg?resize=300%2C296"}],"video":[]}}

Tim Brown, a Republican from Crawfordsville, would up the tax by $1 per pack. \n\nThat would result in an estimated increase of $278.3 million during the next fiscal year and $297.9 million the following fiscal year, most of which would fund reimbursements of Medicaid providers. \n\nState Rep. Cindy Kirchhofer, R-Beech Grove, wants to raise the tax by $1.50 per pack for a regular-sized pack, with higher increases as pack size gets bigger. \n\nThe higher tax would bring in an estimated new $406.8 million in the first fiscal year and $435.5 million the following fiscal year. From those increases, local governments would see an additional $11 million and $12 million in the first fiscal year and following fiscal year, respectively. \n\nKirchhofer\u2019s bill also would raise the smoking age from 18 to 21. \n\nThen, there\u2019s the proposal from state Rep. Charlie Brown, D-Gary, who\u2019s adamantly against smoking. \n\nHis bill would increase the tax by $2 per pack, bringing in an estimated $530.1 million in the first fiscal year of the increased per-pack charge. \n\nThe additional revenue under that bill would fund medical residency education as well as efforts by the state to emphasize the prevention and reduction of tobacco use by minorities, pregnant women, children and youth; encourage smoking cessation; and provide research on issues related to the reduction of tobacco use.\n\nIf passed, the bill would bring $274.7 million more both for medical residency education and prevention and for tobacco reduction efforts. \n\nThe Legislative Services Agency estimates that increasing the tax rate by $2 would decrease usage, predicting the number of packs sold would drop by about 17 percent each year during the next two fiscal years. \n\nMore proposals to increase tax revenue\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Sheila Klinker of Lafayette would put a tax of 10 cents per milliliter on liquids that contain nicotine for use in electronic smoking devices. \n\nEstimates by the Legislative Services Agency show potential revenues ranging from $3.4 million to $6 million annually, with an additional $200,000 to $400,000 in potential sales tax revenue. \n\nHalf of that additional revenue would go to the general fund, and the other half would go into the Addiction Services Fund. \n\nBloomington\u2019s state Sen. Mark Stoops, a Democrat, has proposed, again, a bill that would allow the Monroe County Council to adopt an ordinance levying an additional local income tax rate between 0.1 percent and 0.25 percent to fund one or more county transit projects. \n\nIf approved this time, the bill\u2019s 0.25 percent local income tax rate would generate an estimated $7.88 million in 2018, $8.29 million in 2019, and $8.74 million in 2020, according to the Legislative Services Agency. \n\nStoops also has authored a bill that would extend that same ability to the state\u2019s other 91 counties, excluding those that can hold a referendum on funding transportation projects under the central Indiana public transportation projects statute. The estimated revenue would vary depending on the county. \n\nFor example, nearby counties, should they implement a 0.25 percent rate, could see combined revenues from 2018 and 2019 ranging from $1.73 million in Orange County to $8.06 million in Morgan County. Lawrence, Greene and Jackson counties could see two-year revenues of $4.41 million, $3 million and $4.92 million, respectively, while Brown County would be excluded from the new potential tax. \n\nA bill proposed by state Rep. Woody Burton, R-Whiteland, would give cities a similar power, but for food and beverage taxes. \n\nIt would allow city and town councils to create and implement a food and beverage tax at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1 percent of the gross retail income from food and beverage sales, exempting transactions where sales tax does not apply. Cities with this tax already in place, or that receive revenue from a similar county tax, would not be eligible under the proposal. \n\nNearby cities with a 1 percent food and beverage tax brought in minimal revenue in the past fiscal year \u2014 about $367,000 in Martinsville, about $385,000 in Mooresville and a little more than $171,000 in Nashville. \n\nBigger cities saw higher revenues during the most recent fiscal year. Towns smaller than Bloomington, such as Avon, Plainfield and Noblesville, brought in more than $1 million in revenue from the food and beverage tax. Carmel, which is comparable in population to Bloomington, raked in just shy of $1.9 million. \n\nState Sen. Luke Kenley, a Republican from Noblesville who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, wants to help the state capture revenue it loses when Hoosiers buy products from retailers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in Indiana. \n\nThose retailers currently don\u2019t have to charge sales tax, which studies have shown resulted in a revenue loss of anywhere from $77 million to $195 million in 2012. \n\nKenley has authored a bill that would require remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax if their gross annual revenue from sales into Indiana is more than $100,000 or if they make sales into Indiana in more than 200 separate transactions.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Megan Banta"},"topics":[{"name":"Tobacco industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gas, cigarette tax increases could be on the way","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"46151","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Martinsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665162","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporter-times.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198386980","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7d384d9e-2b1f-11e5-b573-6b82e880093f.png?_dc=1436984995"}],"video":[]}}

A lawmaker\u2019s occupation is one of many factors that may influence how he or she legislates, but experts say it can have a big impact.\n\n\u201cIf you change the mix of occupations represented in the legislature, you change the mix of attitudes on laws,\u201d said Paul Helmke, a professor of practice at Indiana University\u2019s School of Public and Environmental Affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s just natural.\u201d\n\nA business owner who has had to meet a payroll will likely have a different perspective on the minimum wage issue than a laborer who has been in union contract negotiations, he said. A public school teacher probably has a different view on education policy than someone who sent their kids to a private school.\n\n\u201cThe perspective you bring when you vote, a lot of times, is based on what you\u2019re doing in life,\u201d Helmke said.\n\nThat\u2019s why people are concerned with the race, occupation, gender and ethnicity of their elected officials, said Marjorie Hershey, professor of political science at IU.\n\n\u201cOne argument traditionally has been the more a legislature looks like the kinds of people it\u2019s representing, its members really understand what the population needs and wants and will put up with,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen it comes to occupations, the Indiana General Assembly doesn\u2019t exactly mirror the state\u2019s workforce. According to occupational employment statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor for May 2015 \u2014 the most recent available online \u2014 Indiana\u2019s 92,490 retail salespersons accounted for the largest percentage of the state\u2019s 2.9 million workers. Combined food preparation and service workers made up the second-largest category, with 84,250 people.\n\nNearly 30 percent of the Indiana General Assembly\u2019s 150 members are business owners, by far the largest occupation category in a Hoosier-Times analysis. The Legislature\u2019s 24 lawyers or attorneys make up the second-largest category, at about 15 percent.\n\nThe Department of Labor\u2019s data set did not include a category specifically for business owners, but lawyers made up about 0.2 percent of the state\u2019s workforce.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that certain professions are more common in state legislatures than in the general population. Serving in the legislature and campaigning for an election takes time, between both regular sessions, interim committees and elections every two or six years. In general, it\u2019s easier for someone who is self-employed to adjust their schedule than someone working on an assembly line, Hershey said.\n\nLawyers and business owners may also be more aware of the effect of specific legislation. Helmke practiced law for more than 14 years before becoming mayor of Fort Wayne in 1987. He said practicing lawyers often come across laws they feel are unjust or don\u2019t make sense, so they run for office to try and change things. It\u2019s a similar situation with business owners.\n\n\u201cIf you run a small business, like an insurance agency, a small manufacturing thing, a floral shop, whatever, you\u2019re used to dealing with governmental regulations and taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you run for the legislature.\u201d\n\nThat seems to be true throughout the country. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 15 percent of legislators in all states listed attorney as their occupation in 2007, while more than 9 percent owned a business. The only more prevalent occupation was full-time legislator, at about 16 percent. Legislator is a full-time position in some states, but it\u2019s still considered part time in Indiana.\n\nThat\u2019s what Hoosiers wanted, said James Madison, emeritus professor of history at IU.\n\n\u201cWe had what you used to call a citizen legislature. It was part time, not professional,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the people, of the people, by the people and for the people. That\u2019s what Hoosiers wanted. They wanted their neighbors to represent them.\u201d\n\nBut some neighbors were better suited to take on such duties while continuing to support themselves and their families. That\u2019s why lawyers, doctors, business owners and farmers were common professions in the Indiana Legislature for most of the state\u2019s history. Over the past half century, though, there have been some changes.\n\nThe Legislature now meets every year, as opposed to every other year when it was founded. There is more pressure to prepare outside of regular sessions and work on summer study commissions, Madison said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a demanding job if you want to do it well,\u201d he said.\n\nIndiana\u2019s economy also changed. There are fewer farmers, and the Legislature reflects that. According to \u201cThe Centennial History of The Indiana General Assembly,\u201d more than 800 farmers served in the state Legislature from 1816 to 1851, accounting for more than half of all the members who served during that period. That figure was down to about a quarter from 1891 to 1929, and about 8 percent for the period from 1971 to 1984. Today, only one Indiana legislator claims farming as his primary occupation, although others do own farms. State Rep. Dave Heine, R-Fort Wayne, owns and operates a family farm, according to his biography on the Indiana House of Representatives Republican Caucus website.\n\nThere are also fewer lawyers. After peaking at 32 percent of legislators who served from 1851 to 1889, the number of lawyers has steadily fallen to about 20 percent of those who served from 1971 to 1984. Helmke thinks this is because there are more lawyers. With more competition and increasing demands of state legislators, some have decided doing both is too much.\n\nThose changes are consistent with national trends. A 2015 article from the Pew Charitable Trust showed the percentage of farmers has fallen to 4.6 percent, half of what it was in 1976. The percentage of lawyers has fallen, too, from 22.3 in 1976 to 14.4 percent in 2015.\n\nOn the flip side, professions that have seen increasing representation among state lawmakers include consultants and nonprofit workers. The share of lawmakers in that occupational category increased from about 3 percent in 1986 to 8.2 percent in 2015. The percentage of legislators who say lawmaking is their main profession has also risen, from 2.7 percent in 1976 to 16.4 percent in 2015.\n\nIndiana only partially follows that trend. State Rep. Karen Engleman, a Republican from Harrison County, is the only member of the Indiana General Assembly to list \u201cstate representative\u201d as her occupation. State Rep. Carey Hamilton, a Democrat from Indianapolis, is the only member of the General Assembly who lists her main occupation as being a leader in the nonprofit sector. She is the executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition.\n\nConsultants, though, make up about 6 percent of Indiana legislators. State Sen. Mark Stoops, a Democrat from Bloomington, is one of those.\n\nThe graphic design and marketing consultant said the time commitment required to serve in the Statehouse, and the pay, can be a huge hurdle for some people. Indiana legislators receive a base salary of $25,435.98 plus a per diem ranging from $161 to $175, depending on the month. They can also earn additional pay for leadership positions.\n\n\u201cI think if you just have a standard 9-to-5 job, there\u2019s no way you can do it,\u201d Stoops said.\n\nAs a result, the perspectives of business owners and white-collar professionals are far more prevalent than those of hourly employees or laborers. Whether that\u2019s good or bad depends on the kind of government people want.\n\n\u201cIf people want their representatives to really understand and speak for them, then their representatives have to be people like them,\u201d said Hershey, the political science professor. \u201cIf instead they want a system governed by people who are more educated, wealthier and more cosmopolitan than they are, that\u2019s fine, but that\u2019s a very different kind of system.\u201d\n\nAttempts to speak with state Sen. Eric Koch, a Republican from Bedford who owns a law firm, were unsuccessful.\n\nHerald-Times reporter Megan Banta contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michael Reschke"},"topics":[{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"A citizen legislature?

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days.

(Photo: Justin Lane, EPA) \n  \nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hundreds of outraged demonstrators converged on San Francisco International Airport Saturday afternoon, in defiance of President Trump's executive order banning refugees and foreign citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries entry into the U.S. \n \nWaving signs reading \u201cMy Grandparents Were One of the Lucky Ones\" and \"One Earth, One People, One Love,\u201d they chanted in full throat, \"You put a wall, we tear it down\" and \"Never again!\" \n \nAs the crowd swelled to as many as 1,000, some protesters spilled onto the road that circled the international terminal, briefly blocking access for cars attempting to get to the terminal. Organizers extended the peaceful protest. \n \nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin, an immigrant himself, and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom were among the protesters. \n \nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee issued a statement, calling the ban \"disgusting.\" \n \n\"As the son of Chinese immigrants, I am disgusted by the President\u2019s Executive Order to target the Muslim community and ban immigrants from entering the United States,\" the mayor said. \n \nThe crowd only began to thin after a federal court in Brooklyn issued a temporary emergency stay halting Trump's order late Saturday. But it remained large, and boisterous, deep into the night. \n \n\"It was chaos,\" Buzz Frahn, an immigration attorney from Palo Alto, Calif., said of the demonstration. \n \nFrahn was one of dozens of lawyers who rushed to the airport to assist families waiting for members to clear customs. He said he was aware of at least five travelers detained who are Iranian. \n \n\u201cMy parents came from Iran right before I was born,\u201d protester Samin Nosrat, 37, of Berkeley told the San Francisco Chronicle . \u201cI am the child of refugees.

If history is any indication, a battle very similar to the one we're preparing to fight today was fought nearly 50 years ago along the Eastern Front. \n \nIt is dangerous to predict the nature and outcome of battles yet to happen; however, historical examples are sometimes useful in order to highlight specific problems. News reports to date of Iraq's defense of Kuwait lead to some interesting particulars. As reported, Iraqi forces are dug into three defensive lines, each with tank redoubts and machine gun bunkers. Extensive minefields up to 400 meters in depth, with antitank ditches and barbed wire entanglements support these defensive lines. In addition to these arrangements, mobile armored reserves are prepared to seal any breach created. During the Iran-Iraq War, similar defensive arrangements were used by Iraqi forces with deadly effect. \n \nWhile it is true that Iraqi force structure is based loosely upon the British brigade system, Iraqi military doctrine stems from a mix of Soviet, Indian, French, and their own indigenous experience. Against a well-armed mechanized opponent, most would agree that a defense in depth is required. Such a defense needs to be supported by high caliber, mobile counterattacking forces. Such counterattacks could, in theory, lead to future offensive operations. \n Preparation for a Showdown  \nSo, in looking into our crystal ball for the future, let's look to the past. In 1943, German field commanders on the Eastern Front viewed the Kursk Bulge as an opportunity to straighten their defensive lines and destroy considerable Soviet forces. Hitler, in particular, felt the opportunity was at hand to destroy a significant part of the Soviet army and radically change the nature of the war. \n \nHitler based this decision to attack at Kursk upon his political situation at the time. He needed a victory to keep his allies in line. He changed the very nature of the operation from a quick strike at Soviet forces when defensive preparations were minor, as Gen Manstein wanted, to a well-prepared, deliberate assault. German troops would wait. They waited to be reinforced and reequipped. Commanders studied and trained for the expected moment when the two armies would clash. As a result, individual troops underwent grueling (raining programs. As one German general observed at the time, no battle has heretofore been so well prepared for. \n \n\n \nThe Germans relied upon superior equipment and technological advancements to make up for their lack of numbers (see Figure 1). Armadas of state-of-the-art aircraft armed with tank-killing cluster munitions and cannon would be in direct support of German assaults. The new Panther and Tiger tanks were rushed out of factories straight into the hands of Panzer troops. Infantry received the new Panzerfaust antitank rocket, which fired a tank killing shaped charge over 30 meters. \n \nUnfortunately for the Germans, all of this required significant time. The date for the assault slipped and with it, the opportunity for success. Originally the assaults were to begin in May, but, ultimately, were postponed until July. The Soviets were not idle, however. They had learned the bitter lessons of the previous two years, and into the Kursk salient they rushed thousands of troops, tanks, artillery, and antitank weapons. Three main defensive lines were established, with a mobile reserve for local counterattacks and a strategic reserve for operations as directed. The total depth of Soviet defenses reached up to 110 miles. Extensive minefields as dense as 5,000 mines per mile of front were laid, as were vast quantities of barbed wire. Antitank artillery and antitank rifles, supported by dug-in tanks, formed \"pack fronts,\" a tactic borrowed from the Germans (see Figure 2). \n \n\n \nAnd they dug. The local population of 100,000, later supplemented by an additional 200,000 laborers, was pressed into service to dig antitank ditches, 3,000 miles of trenchlines, and roads. Main positions were dug-in and camouflaged as were alternate positions. Decoy positions were also established so that prep fires would be spread out. Finally, elite armored divisions were positioned behind these defensive works to act as a counterattack force or to take the offensive as the situation warranted. Topographical surveys were also made for thousands of tank and artillery guns so that each square meter could be contested. The Soviets had partisans working in the German rear as well; this caused material damage and drained much-needed German combat strength from the front. In addition, they had a spy in Hitler's headquarters. To this day, no one knows who it was, but the information about the Germans' forthcoming offensive was well known to Moscow. \n The Battle Begins  \nThe opening of the Battle of Kursk saw offensive Soviet airstrikes and massive counter artillery fire. The German assault timetable was disrupted and confusion resulted. Lead armored elements quickly bogged down in Soviet minefields and tank-killing zones. The new German tanks suffered numerous mechanical problems of the type usually associated with raw equipment, leaving some advance units without their heavy armor. German infantry became separated from its tanks causing German tanks to become victims of Soviet tank-hunting infantry teams. Soviet artillery and dug-in tanks, which largely survived the German prep fires, succeeded in further separating infantry from tanks. Minefields were also effective in slowing down armored/ infantry assaults, allowing the Soviet pack fronts ample time to engage tanks. \n \nEven though the Soviet air force was outclassed in the air, it did strike hard at German armored units. Although German air destroyed considerable numbers of Soviet tanks, it concentrated more on the Soviet's moving mobile reserve. German airstrikes against heavily fortified positions also went largely ineffective. \n \nDespite these obstacles, the Germans were masters of the offensive art and had, in several places, made significant progress. On 12 July, the greatest tank battle of the war occurred when the Soviets launched their armored reserves, and 1,500 tanks clashed in an epic engagement. Confusion reigned supreme that day as tanks from both sides intermixed and kept their respective air arms from providing adequate support. At the close of the day, the Germans had advanced 25 miles at the cost of 10,000 troops killed and 350 tanks destroyed. The Germans had made progress, but the cost in unit cohesion and attrition of tanks caused the advance to falter. Once the German offensive had ground to a halt, the Soviets effectively counterattacked, not only retaking territory lost at the beginning of the battle, but gaining much more as well. The Soviets had effectively shattered the German armored forces. Of the 70 German divisions taking part in the Kursk Campaign, 30 were destroyed. German losses alone totaled 70,000 killed or wounded, with 3,000 tanks, 1,000 guns, 5,000 motor vehicles, and 1,400 planes destroyed. \n Does the Analogy Fit?  \nSouthern Kuwait is not Kursk. Iraq does not have the vast resources the Soviets did in 1943. But many of the same conditions exist. First, Iraqi forces have had time to build up their defensive obstacles. Any smart Iraqi battalion commander would have had his \"moles\" digging in since at least 1 September. This has given defensive planners nearly four months of harrassment-free digging, minelaying, and wire stringing. They have had the opportunity to design a defense in depth on the ground of their choosing. In addition, they have had the luxury to conduct detailed fire support and barrier planning. To breach such a defense will require significant fire power and engineer assets. (See engineer focus on pp. 16-31 of this issue for more on this topic.) \n \nOur intelligence sources will be able to detect only so much. Iraqi entrenching preparations for their armor reportedly will reduce infrared detectability by 80 to 90 percent. Underground bunkers are even more difficult to pinpoint as are minefields. The precision targeting needed for precision-guided munitions is unlikely. Dumb bombs are likely to strike unoccupied ground since narrow trenchlines are difficult to hit, a lesson learned during World War I. Lead elements will more than likely discover strong points only after the initial Iraqi round is fired. The quality of Iraqi troops needed for these types of defensive operations need not be high. As demonstrated during the Iran-Iraq War, low-quality troops can occupy outer defensive positions, allowing better-equipped Revolutionary Guards to conduct counterattacks or offensive operations. \n \nWhile individual news items have tended to paint a rather murky portrait of Iraqi defensive lines, taken together, they can give us a fair idea of what we are likely to find in southern Kuwait.* The main defensive line is made up of three parallel defensive belts, with a total depth of 6 to 15 kilometers, supported by minefields as deep as 400 meters. Antitank ditches are quoted to be 3.6 meters deep and 2.5 meters wide. These obstacles are probably 1,000 meters in front of the armored revetments (see Figure 3). Iraqi armor, mostly T-55s, is likely to form pack fronts, i.e., concentrated antitank fires being directed by one commander against one target. Earthen berms along newly constructed roads and tracks should allow Iraqi tanks to move where the action is and fight from protected positions. Over 500 miles of new roads have reportedly been constructed for this purpose. Battalion strongpoints are likely, allowing the defenders to fire into the Hanks of breaching parties. Between these strongpoints will probably be \"fire sacks,\" based on the Soviet model, where massed indirect fires are concentrated. All of these defensive arrangements are designed to grind down the attacker, allowing the tactical reserve to seal the breach. \n \n\n \nIt is estimated that there are 25 Iraqi divisions in Kuwait and southern Iraq. An additional 30 divisions could be brought from the Iran-Iraq border. Iraq's elite Revolutionary Guard, equipped with T-72s and BMP-2s, form the strategic reserve while older tanks, mostly T-55s, are deployed in the main defensive belts (see Figure 4). Artillery would be expected to be immediately behind these defensive lines and could be supplemented by rockets and aircraft. \n \n\n \nSouthern Kuwait is not Kursk. Nor is the Iraqi army as well equipped as the Allies in Saudi Arabia. The similarities in the defensive arrangements are, however, disturbingly alarming. In addition, like Kursk, the Iraqis have been allowed to complete their defenses unmolested. \n \nManeuver warfare doctrine requires flexibility and options. If political restrictions become arduous, such as restricting friendly movement into Iraqi territory, then attrition warfare will rule. There is a real possibility that siege warfare could become the order of the day. The Battle for Kursk has been considered the largest single airground engagement in history. This battle had every element of combat we consider important today. Using Kursk as a yardstick, we can see how costly an attack straight into the teeth of the Iraqi defense would be. Like stationary World War I battles, these trenchlines can be breached, but the cost in lives would be enormous. The main attractiveness of this type of defense is that even if massive artillery and air firepower are brought to bear, some defenders would survive. \n \nAt Kursk, the Soviets poured a tremendous amount of military power into a relatively small area. The rest of the Eastern Front in July 1943 was not as well defended. The Germans could have struck elsewhere to obtain their military and political objectives but chose not to. Like Kursk, Iraqi defenses are strong only along the Kuwaiti/ Saudi border. By my estimation, we have four options open to flank this type of defense: (1) An amphibious landing behind main enemy defensive lines; (2) a sweeping \"left hook,\" by U.S. Army units, penetrating Iraqi territory and ending at Basra; (3) an air assault landing behind Iraqi defensive belts; or (4) some combination of all the above. In order to force Iraq to commit its reserves, it may even be necessary to assault or feint an assault on Iraq's main defensive lines before launching one of these four options. As Steve Biddle of the Institute for Defense Analysis has recently surmised, \"Historically speaking, that sort of defense has been hard to defeat. It's not to say we can't do it, but it can't be done cheaply or quickly.\" \n \n*This section is based on information contained in the following list of publications: Los Angeles Times, 28 November 1990; U.S. News & World Report, 12 November 1990; International Defense Review, Vol. 23, No. 10, 1990; Jane's Defence Weekly, 3 November 1990; Identifying the Iraqi Threat and How They Fight (unclassified source published by the Army Intelligence and Threat Analysis Center).","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Kuwait news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Iraq's Defense of Kuwait and the Battle of Kursk","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Leatherneck Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"181804301","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Leatherneck Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://mca-marines.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198398577","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Noosa News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606653302","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Noosa News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.noosanews.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198400824","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T14:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also, having a snack with fiber and protein will keep your blood sugar stable, therefore preventing excess snacking and cravings.\" \n \nWith the interest in healthy eating at an all-time high, there's been an incredible surge in healthy snacking options. And while there are plenty of products that are simply health halos, there are some niche healthy food brands that focus on using a short list of healthy, whole food ingredients. Check out some of the best new products below and then be sure to avoid these 32 Foods with Health Halos to Stop Eating Immediately . \n \n\n \nMoon Juice is beloved by health obsessed celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Karlie Kloss, who swear by their products for their snacks and smoothies. All of their products are formulated with esoteric, good-for-you ingredients. In the case of their Vanilla Mushroom Protein, you've got activated brown rice protein (easily assimilated by the body) and reishi and cordyceps mushrooms, which are said to help boost the immune system while building muscle and stamina and supporting the liver, kidney, and adrenals. This mix not only blends well, it won't cause bloating and it's low carb and low sugar. \n \n\n \nMost ice cream replacements taste like glorified frozen, flavored water\u2014not so with Halo Top, which manages to have a creamy texture despite its low calorie count. How low? Pints range from 240 to 360 for the whole pint. But that's not all. Halo is also low sugar, low carb, low fat, high protein, and is made without the use of synthetic growth hormones. Plus they come in a long list of flavors ranging from classic Vanilla to Birthday Cake. \"I don't typically encourage ice cream as a go-to healthy snack, but with 2 grams of fiber, 6 grams of protein, and only about 60 calories per ½ cup serving, there are far worse sweets you can indulge as a snack,\" says Zuckerbrot who recommends topping your serving with ½ cup berries for an extra 4 grams of belly-filling fiber when your afternoon sugar craving or post-dinner sweet tooth hits. Check out our exclusive list of 26 Diet Ice Creams\u2014Ranked! to find out other best and worst options. \n \n\n \nYou might think oatmeal is healthy, but most flavored ones are loaded with calories, sugar, and preservatives. Opt for plain, unflavored oats and top them with this unique spice blend from Just Spices, which is made with almonds, coconut, vanilla, cinnamon, and ginger\u2014no hidden chemicals or fishy ingredients. If you're not into oatmeal, the brand makes a long list of other spice blends to liven up your lean proteins and steamed veggies without adding many calories, fat, carbs, or sugar. \n \n\n \nAside from cottage cheese which, let's be honest, isn't the most mouth-watering, cheese tends to be a dietary indulgence. Not so with Kite Hill's artisanal options. Not only are they insanely delicious, they're actually low in fat and calories because they're almond milk-based. Their soft ripened cheese, for example, is made with nothing besides almond milk, salt, enzymes, and cultures and it has just 4 grams of fat per serving (and these are healthy unsaturated fats from almonds), no sugar and 5 grams of protein. \"Another reason these are a good choice is that they're fairly low-carb (2-4 grams of carbohydrates),\" says Zuckerbrot, who suggests pairing them with high-fiber crackers. Speaking of cheese, though, you won't want to miss the Eat This, Not That!: The Cheese Guide ! \n \n\n \nIf turmeric isn't a staple in your diet, you should make that change immediately. A staple in Asian and Indian cuisine, it's one of the most potent anti-inflammatories. It's also antibacterial, antiviral (read: perfect for cold weather!), and packs flavor minus the calories, fat, sugar, and sodium. The options are endless if you enjoy cooking since the root is very versatile (you can grate it or buy it dried and sprinkle it), but to easily work this superfood into your diet grab this snack from Navitas Naturals. They're a pioneer in the superfood space and this particular snack combines turmeric with heart-healthy organic almonds\u2014no fillers. \n \n\n \nChickpeas are a healthy high fiber, high protein addition to most people's diets. The most popular way to enjoy them is hummus, but portion control can be difficult and that can be problematic for weight control because one thing hummus doesn't have going for it is that it's high in calories. Instead, opt for a portion controlled high fiber, high protein alternative via Hippeas unique organic chickpea puffs. Available in four flavors, each bag has about 90 calories and there are no additives or preservative and all ingredients are organic. \"Pair this snack with a piece of fruit (like an apple, pear, berries) for an extra boost of fiber for minimal additional calories,\" says Zuckerbrot. \"Another great thing about Hippeas is that they're available at Starbucks, so they're a readily available good choice snack when you didn't prepare ahead of time.\" \n \nRELATED: 28 Starbucks Menu Items That Diet Experts Love \n \n\n \nFor the next \"it\" food, it's all about broccoli (at least as far as dehydrated veggies go!). Rhythm Superfood, a pioneer in the kale space with a long list of dehydrated options, launched their range of broccoli bites made using dehydrated broccoli florets tossed in a seasoning of seeds, nuts, herbs, and spices. All of their options are high in protein and fiber and packed with superfoods like cashews and sunflower seeds. Zuckerbrot calls these bites \"ideal for smart snacking\" and suggests pairing them with an apple for an extra 4 grams fiber (the calories will still be low at around 120). \n \n\n \nLiving Intentions is a pioneer in the raw and sprouted food space (they've been at it for over a decade!). They're a mission-driven company focused on bring innovative raw, sprouted, gluten-free, and vegan ingredient combinations to the market; case and point their Tropical Bee Pollen Sprouted Trail Mix. All the calories, fats, and sugars come from healthy, whole food ingredients like sprouted Brazil nuts, sprouted hazelnuts (sprouted nuts have more nutritional and digestive benefits than regular nuts), golden berries, coconut chips, and bee pollen powder (bee pollen is the pollen ball that has been packed by worker honeybees into pellets), which is densely packed with nutrients. \n \n\n \nGraze Snacks is the Birchbox of snacks. They've got over 100 options, which they'll deliver to you in a curated way every two weeks. Among the options are rhubarb and pear compote, brownies made with beetroot, and beetroot crisp, all of which are free of artificial colors, flavors or preservatives, free of high fructose corn syrup, and have 0 grams trans fat. Equally as important\u2014they're packaged in portion-controlled snack packs. \n \n\n \nAlso known as the Incan Peanut, Sacha Inchi seeds contain the earth's highest source of plant-based omega-3s\u201420 times the omega-3 content found in wild caught pink salmon! Omega-3s contain essential fatty acids that have been associated with safeguarding physical and mental health. These are also packed with 8.5 grams of protein per serving and a healthy dose of fiber and iron . You can eat them on their own or they work great in homemade trail mixes, smoothies, and nut butters (you can also cook/bake with them). Alternatively, you can try one of Imlak'esh Organics clusters which combine Sacha Inchi seeds with other superfoods like goji berries, organic mangos, popped quinoa, and cayenne (all organic). \n \n\n \nSeaweed offers one of the broadest range of minerals of any food on the planet (one serving has more calcium than broccoli and almost as much protein as legumes). It's also fat, cholesterol, and carb free and low in calories. Skip the sushi\u2014white rice is just filler\u2014and instead opt for a crunchy seaweed snack like the ones from Annie Chun which are baked (not fried) and made with a short list of ingredients for flavoring. \n \n\n \nDon't be alarmed that one of Rule Breaker's brownies or blondies has 170 calories because they're big\u2014over 60 grams per serving. Note, however, they're so delicious you'll have a hard time stopping at just one. This might surprise you because unlike most brownies lining supermarket shelves these are not only made with a recognizable ingredient list, but they're based on beans\u2014yes, beans\u2014meaning they're packed with protein and fiber. As far as brownies go, this is about as good as it gets. And, no, you won't actually taste even a hint of savory bean flavor. \n \n\n \nIf you follow digital influencers and models on social media you're likely familiar with Dirty Lemon. The functional beverage brand makes raw drinks aimed at detoxing body, improving sleep, and improving skin/hair health (an energizing blend is launching soon) and they're all surprisingly refreshing and flavorful despite their low 10-calorie count. Dirty Lemon's signature drink is their Raw Detox made with activated charcoal, cold-pressed lemon juice (squeezed on-site just before bottling), ginger, and dandelion root\u2014basically, all powerful anti-inflammatories that most people would benefit from adding to their diet (and when it comes to activated charcoal, beauty routine!). \n \n\n \nThe interesting thing about tiger nuts is that they're a vegetable (you didn't think we'd actually recommend you eat tiger bits, did you?) with a versatile, slightly coconut-y taste. They're a superfood that's growing in popularity and you're all but certain to hear more about them as 2017 gets going. Organic Gemini is the brand, started by a husband and wife team, that are spearheading the introduction of this crunchy snack. In addition to flour, oil, and smoothie mixes, they make a fast-growing assortment of raw snacks. We like them best as a whole, raw, organic snack (you loose fiber if you opt for the peeled variety). You can eat them as is or they go great in Greek yogurt, on a salad, or as an add-on crunchy texture to just about any protein\u2014they pack a whopping 10 grams of fiber per serving (40 percent DV), no sugar, and 2 grams of protein. \n \n\n \nThe problem with corn is that most crops in the US are GMO. Not so with this cereal, which is made from organic, non-GMO purple corn. It has a clean, delicious flavor while being very low in fat and it has 2 grams of both protein and fiber. And it's purple! The one downside is that it could be lower in sugar (5 gram per 30-gram serving), but that's still lower than most sweet cereals and it's free of high fructose corn syrup, meaning it's the perfect option to help get the kiddos off those Fruity Pebbles. And while we're talking about breakfast and morning foods, make sure you brush up on these 37 Worst Breakfast Habits for Weight Loss ! \n \n\n \nIf you know Purely Elizabeth, it's probably because they're the first brand to bring probiotic-enriched granola to the market (probiotics don't tend to hold up well to the heat so this was a major innovation). There's a lot more to the brand, however, including a line of ancient grain blends. If you're tired of classic granola check out their Blueberry Hemp Ancient Grain blend which enriches oats with hemp seeds, amaranth, millet flakes, quinoa flakes, chia seeds, and a handful other organic ingredients. Like most granolas this one could loose a little sugar but\u2014at least\u2014the source is coconut sugar, which is low-glycemic and unrefined. Grains are a great addition to most people's diet and this mix is a delicious way to introduce many that you may have never considered. That said while this is a balanced snack Zuckerbrot is quick to point out that it's calorie dense which may make it a difficult selection for someone attempting to lose weight. \n \n\n \nJicama is one of the most under-the-radar root vegetables ever, so we're betting you never thought to snack on it as a chip. \"JicaChips are a great alternative to potato chips,\" says Zuckerbrot. \"Jicama is considered a non-starchy vegetable so they're lower in carbohydrates than traditional potato chips.\" Flavor-wise, jicama is a cross between an apple and a potato, but it has 50 percent fewer calories and carbs than a potato. One jicama also has as much fiber as eight cups of cooked oatmeal, as much Vitamin C as two oranges, as much potassium as two banana, and it's got healthy gut-boosting prebiotics. Jica Chips is capitalizing on the health benefits and ease of baking of this root veggie with their line of flavored jicama-based chips. They've got six flavors that cover both sweet and savory palettes and one serving has 100 calories and between three and six ingredients. \n \n\n \nUrban Remedy was founded by a licensed acupuncturist, herbalist, and certified Chinese nutritionist and the brand specializes in functional foods. It's not typical for crackers to help boost your metabolism but the brand's Carrot Curry Crackers do just that. Made with a clean list of organic ingredients, they're low calorie (60 per 50-gram serving) and pack a ton of vitamin A (140 percent DV). Who knew organic carrots and their juices would make a great base for a cracker? Note however that this snack won't necessarily keep you feeling full. \"These crackers only have 1.5 grams protein and 1.5 grams fiber per serving, but at 60 calories per serving, they're still low-calorie, and thus suited as a nibble.\" \n \n\n \nOne of the first things most people will cut out if they're trying to make healthy changes is pasta. White flour pasta is little more than empty calories. If you're having a tough time cutting the cord, check out Pasta Chips, a line of Italian-inspired snacks made from freshly baked pasta dough. They're not a healthy food, but they're better than regular pasta and certainly better than run-of-the-mill chips (they have 20 percent less fat than pita chips and 60 percent less fat than potato chips). Again, however, these shouldn't be considered a health food per se as they're made with semolina wheat, which is no better than a refined carbohydrate. \n \n\n \nThese aren't your mama's Brussels sprouts!

Time \n      \nProtesters gather at JFK International Airport's Terminal 4 on Jan. 28, 2017, to demonstrate against President Trump's executive order to suspend refugee arrivals. (Photo: Bryan R. Smith, AFP/) \n  \nPresident Trump\u2019s ban on immigration by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries ran into at least a temporary roadblock Saturday night, after a U.S. District judge in Brooklyn granted an emergency stay sought by immigrants\u2019 rights lawyers. \n \nThe judge\u2019s ruling applies to those who have already arrived in the U.S. and those who are in transit who hold valid visas. The decision halts part of Trump\u2019s executive order, which barred citizens from those seven countries for the next 90 days. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said that by Saturday evening, its agents had stopped 109 foreigners at U.S. airports based on Trump\u2019s order and prevented another 173 people from boarding flights headed for the U.S. \n \nAfter U.S. District Court Ann Donnelly granted the stay, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which had filed suit to block Trump\u2019s ban, issued a one-word celebratory tweet: \u201cVictory!!!!!!\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed Friday, suspends the entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halts admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for three months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nMore coverage:  \n \nProtests erupt: The scene at JFK \n \nTrump says immigration ban working 'nicely\u2019 as protests, detainments hit airports \n \nHow the world responded:  Iran retaliates, Canada opens arms after Trump immigration ban \n \nU.S. immigrants: 'Our president is trying to divide us' \n \nGoogle CEO, tech leaders weighs in on how move affects their employees  \n \nHow ban is affecting travel \n \nPeople flood social media with tales of stranded family, friends \n \nTrump says he's 'hit the ground running at a record pace' \n \nA Syrian and his American wife are stuck in Iraq because of Trump's ban \n \nA senior Homeland Security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide an operational update on Trump\u2019s executive order, said the department quickly overhauled its screening procedures after Trump signed the order Friday. The department issued new guidance to its Customs and Border Protection officers in the field and adjusted its computerized targeting system to identify people who are barred entry through the executive order. \n \nThe official said the order allowed legal permanent residents \u2014 known as green-card holders \u2014 and foreigners who were granted special visas for Iraqi and Afghan interpreters, to enter after undergoing a full background check and in-person interview. The official said 81 people made it through that process and were allowed to enter the country. The official said Homeland Security\u2019s legal team was reviewing the New York federal judge's Saturday ruling and that the department would adjust its practices in line with the order. \n \nIn Virginia, another federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Saturday night, directing the Department of Homeland Security to allow lawyers to meet with legal permanent residents detained at Washington Dulles International Airport. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema also forbade Homeland Security from deporting any of the green-card holders for seven days. \n \n\u201cPresident Trump never gave a second thought to how his discriminatory, un-American order would actually play out on the ground,\u201d Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said after the judge's ruling. \u201cWe will continue to explore any legal options available to the Commonwealth to oppose this misguided effort.\u201d \n \nKaren Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, which was part of the suit in New York, said the lawyers were \u201ctremendously relieved\u201d by the judge\u2019s stay. But she said the legal team was quickly moving to free the immigrants who remained in U.S Customs and Border Protection custody Saturday night based on Trump\u2019s executive order. \n \nShe challenged the DHS numbers, calling them \"alternative facts.\" \n \n\"We have 50 Iranian green-card holders being held from one single flight at (Los Angeles International Airport),\" Tumlin said. \"It doesn't add up.\" \n \nThe fallout from the president's temporary ban struck with full force earlier Saturday, blocking some travelers from boarding their planes overseas, compelling others to turn around upon arrival in the U.S., and prompting customs agents at New York's JFK Airport to detain at least a dozen people, including a former Iraqi translator for the U.S. military in Baghdad. \n \nThe growing chaos also sparked legal challenges, airport protests, condemnations from politicians and denunciations from advocacy groups. \n \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Saturday tweeted an offer of support to those who had been stopped at the state's airports: \"I have directed Port Authority, @NYSDOS, & my Counsel's Office to jointly explore all legal options to assist anyone detained at NY airports.\" \n   \nI have directed Port Authority, @NYSDOS , & my Counsel's Office to jointly explore all legal options to assist anyone detained at NY airports pic.twitter.com/AT8p3rstsD \n\u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 28, 2017   \nCuomo's tweet linked to a statement in which he objected to refugees being blocked from entering the U.S. \n \n\"I never thought I'd see the day when refugees, who have fled war-torn countries in search of a better life, would be turned away from our doorstep. We are a nation of bridges, not walls, and a great many of us still believe in the words 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses \u2026' \" he wrote. \"This is not who we are, not who we should be.\" \n     CLOSE      \nSara Flounders from Jersey City at the Union Square subway station en route to JFK protests. Rick Green/NorthJersey.com \n    \nThe reverberations began only hours after Trump signed the executive order Friday. In brief remarks while signing his latest executive orders Saturday, Trump maintained the order isn't a \"Muslim ban.\" \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. We\u2019re going to have a strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years,\" he said. \n \nThe ban includes green card holders, who will need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States, a senior administration official said in a White House briefing Saturday. Green card holders already in the U.S. will need to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, according to the official, who declined to be identified under the rules of the briefing. \n \nSpeaking to hundreds of demonstrators at JFK Airport, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called the ban ineffective, discriminatory, \"disgusting,\" and said it \"goes against every ounce of our traditions from George Washington onward.\" \n \n\"We are here to say it should be stopped and be revoked,\" he said. \n \nAbout 50 people were detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said Alia Salem, executive director for DFW Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Families have been waiting at Terminal D in anticipation of meeting relatives who been held up in U.S Customs. A representative with CAIR met with families waiting for relatives. Some of them have been waiting for several hours. \n \nAt Philadelphia International Airport, two Syrian families, described as Christians, were briefly detained Saturday after arriving from Qatar and sent back three hours later. The families included two brothers, their wives and two children, according to a family member form Allentown, Pa.,  NBC10 reported . \"This is like a nightmare come true,\" said Joseph Assali, who noted that the families had visas and green cards legally obtained months ago. \n \nMohammed Al Rawi, chief information officer for Los Angeles County, said on Facebook that his father was removed from a flight in Qatar as a direct result of the order. \"My 71-year-old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas,\" he wrote. \n \nForeigners studying at U.S. universities who were part of study-abroad programs were also stuck. Even Customs and Border Protection agents were confused about how to handle Trump\u2019s order and responding in different ways, he said. \n \nThose holding dual nationality in the seven nations involved in the ban will also be barred from entering the United States, the  Wall Street Journal  reported citing a statement from the State Department that has yet to be released. \n   \nPleased to announce w/ @NydiaVelazquez the release of Hameed Jhalid Darweesh from detention at JFK. pic.twitter.com/AeKDhIPp7k \n\u2014 (((Rep.

After being released Saturday afternoon, Darweesh said he had feared he would be sent back to Iraq, which his family fled because of death threats. \n \nWhen asked by reporters outside the airport what he thought of Trump, Darweesh said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

America is the land of freedom.\u201d \n \nHaider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who was trying to join his wife and child and detained along with Darweesh, was released hours later Saturday. His wife worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq as an accountant, was granted a refugee visa and is now living in Houston. Alshawi was approved for a visa to join his wife and their 7-year-old son on Jan. 11. \n \nAccording to a  federal complaint  filed on behalf of two Iraqis being held at JFK airport, one attorney approached Customs and Border Patrol agents with a request to speak to his client, but was told they were not the ones to talk to about seeing him. \n \n\"Who is the person to talk to?\" the lawyer asked, according to the complaint.

Don't want them here,\" he said. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nTrump executive order sows fear among refugees in Ariz. \n  \nThe executive order, which he said was aimed at protecting Americans from terrorist attacks, singled out Syrian refugees as \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" \n \nWhen the refugee program resumes, the executive order calls for changes to \"prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\" \n \n\"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\" Trump said. \n \nCAIR said it will file a federal lawsuit Monday in the Eastern District of Virginia to challenge the constitutionality of the order, charging its apparent purpose and underlying motive is to ban people of the Islamic faith from Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nIn N.Y., refugees awaiting family face uncertainty, fear \n  \n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d said CAIR National Litigation Director Lena F. Masri. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n \nMarielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups representing the Iraqi men detained at JFK, said the lawsuit is directed solely at immigrants who have been caught in legal limbo following Trump\u2019s announcement. The lawyers are trying to expand it into a class action suit to cover the untold number of refugees caught in the same situation. \n \nHincapié said they are planning separate lawsuits challenging the legality of Trump\u2019s executive actions on immigration, partly because they target majority Muslim nations. But she said for now, they simply want to resolve the cases of people who are being detained at airports. They are trying to get an emergency hearing before a judge this weekend. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nIn Kentucky, Trump order \u2018devastating\u2019 to local refugees \n  \n\u201cThese are people who already had a horrific experience of being a refugee,\u201d she said. \u201cThey left everything behind.

Below we bring you the most famous speech he made on, Wednesday January 29 1986, at the steps of Uganda\u2019s Parliament after he was sworn in as president. \n\nOf course, we may have some bad elements amongst us \n\nWe are different from previous governments \n\nTo end killings of innocent Ugandans \n\nWe have solved the problem of division along tribal lines \n\nUganda has had a lot of political quacks \n\nThe president travel in executive jets, yet population is poverty? \n\nFull speech \n\nNO ONE should think that what is happening today is a mere change of guard: it is a fundamental change in the politics of our country. \n\nIn Africa, we have seen so many changes that change, as such, is nothing short of mere turmoil. \n\nWe have had one group getting rid of another one, only for it to turn out to be worse than the group it displaced. \n\nPlease do not count us in that group of people: the National Resistance Movement is a clear-headed movement with clear objectives and a good membership. \n\nOf course, we may have some bad elements amongst us \u2013 this is because we are part and parcel to Ugandan society as it is, and we may, therefore, not be able completely to guard against infiltration by wrong elements. \n\nIt is, however, our deliberate policy to ensure that we uplift the quality of politics in our country. We are quite different from the previous people in power who encouraged evil instead of trying to fight it. \n\nYou may not be familiar with our programme, since you did not have access to it while we were in the bush so I shall outline a few of its salient points; \n\nThe first point in our programme is the restoration of democracy. The people of Africa-the people of Uganda-are entitled to democratic government. \n\nIt is not a favour from any government: it is the right of the people of Africa to have democratic government. The sovereign power in the land must be the population, not the government. The government should not be the master, but the servant of the people. \n\nIn our liberated zones, the first thing we started with was the election of village Resistance Committees. My mother, for instance, cannot go to parliament; but she can, surely, become a member of a committee so that she, too, can make her views heard. We have, therefore, set up village, muluka, gombolola and district committees. \n\nLater we shall set up a national parliament directly elected by the people. This way we shall have both committee and parliamentary democracy. We don\u2019t want to elect people who will change sides once they are in parliament. If you want to change sides, you must go back and seek the mandate of the people who elected you. \n\nDemocracy \n\nSome of these points are for the future, but right now I want to emphasise that the first point in our political programme is democracy for the people of Uganda. \n\nIt is a birthright to which all the people of Uganda are entitled. \n\nThe committees we have set up in these zones have a lot of power. You cannot, for instance, join the army or the police without being cleared by the village committee. \n\nYou must get a recommendation from the people in your village to say that you are not a rogue. Hence, the soldiers who are joining us from other armies will have to be referred back to their villages for recommendation. The same applies to the police. \n\nSuppose, for instance, that we want to recruit some 500 soldiers from the District of Rakai and say 10,000 youths in the area apply to join. If 5,000 of those are cleared by their area committees as people of good character, the selecting military team will choose the most physically fit from among those, and we shall end up with an army that is both of good character and in good physical condition. This is an example of some of the work to be done by the village committees. \n\nAnother important aspect of the committees is that they should serve as a citizens\u2019 intelligence system. If I go to address a rally in Semuto, Rape-ka or Nakaseke, I shall first meet the muluka and gombolola committees in the area. \n\nThey will tell me whether the muluka chiefs are thieves, or the hospital personnel are selling drugs, or whether there are soldiers in the area who are misbehaving. They are thus able to act as watchdogs for the population and guard against the misuse of power. \n\nThe second point in our programme is the security of person and property. Every person in Uganda must be absolutely secure to live wherever he or she wishes. Any individual or any group of persons who threatens the security of our people must be smashed without mercy. \n\nSecurity \n\nThe people of Uganda should only die from natural causes that are beyond our control, but not at the hands of fellow citizens who continue to walk the length and breadth of our land freely. \n\nWhen we were in Nairobi during the peace talks, it was a very painful experience sitting in a room with criminals across the table. 1 was advised that being a leader, you have to be diplomatic. \n\nThis prompted me to ask: \u201cBut does diplomacy apply to criminals as well?\u201d to which the answer was, \u201cYes\u201d. I saw then that the whole process was a farce. \n\nWe tried peacefully to push the case that the Amin elements, and people like Bazilio Okello, who had killed people in broad daylight, must be excluded from government. \n\nOur voice, however, was a lonely one because there were so many pressures from the International community which is interested only in trade. They do not care how many skeletons we have in Uganda: all they care about is for the road to be opened so that their goods can have free passage. We, therefore, made our position very clear: we were not going to take part in any government which included and Involved criminals. \n\nUnfortunately these people believed they had tricked us. Tito Okello, for instance, came back saying that my signing the agreement showed that they had removed the teeth from the salambwa (poisonous snake). \n\nOur position, however, has always been very clear. If you play tricks with us, we shall play tricks with you; if you are honest with us, we shall be honest with you; if you are violent against us, we shall be violent against you. \n\nWe are people who pay others in their own currency and we never use cowardly tactics. When I was in the bush, I had a lot of pressure from people who said that we should assassinate people like Obote, Muwanga and Bazilio. \n\nAgainst assassination \n\nI disagreed because I argued that when you assassinate people like that, you turn them into martyrs and heroes. What you need is to develop enough strength to enable you to sweep that kind of garbage to where it belongs: on the dungheap of history. \n\nWhy should anybody bother to kill small people like Bazilio? You may kill Bazilio Okello but you will be left with many other Bazilios. \n\nTherefore, the security of the people of Uganda is their right and not a favour bestowed by any regime. \n\nNo regime has a right to kill any citizen of this country, or to beat any citizen at a road block. \n\nWe make it clear to our soldiers that if they abuse any citizen, the punishment they will receive will teach them a lesson. As for killing people \u2013 if you kill a citizen, you yourself will be killed. \n\nDuring our struggle, we executed five soldiers of the National Resistance Army for killing people in Bulemezi, Ngoma and Fort Portal. One of these soldiers had killed a doctor in order to steal his money. \n\nWhat, on the other hand, has been happening in Kampala? Recently, people were massacred in Luwero and a high-powered delegation was sent there: you know these so-called high-powered delegations led by Excellencies and honourables, etc. Personally, I do not like being called \u2018Excellency\u2019. \n\nPeople in Bulemezi call me Yoweri or Mzee wa Kazi. Now, these Excellencies, and honourable ministers and high-ranking military personnel, and what-have-you went to Luwero. Can you imagine what they did? \n\nWe were told that they had transferred the person who had killed the people in Luwero to another station! \n\nCan you imagine? Someone kills 100, 50 or even two people and you say you have transferred him to another area? It was suggested that the solution to some of our problems would be for Kampala to be completely demilitarized. \n\nDisciplining soldiers \n\nSo I asked: \u201cWhere are you going to take these criminal soldiers? Even if you take them to a national park they will kill the animals there!\u201d The solution, therefore, is to put criminal soldiers where they belong: in prison. \n\nThe third point in our programme is the question of the unity of our country. Past regimes have used sectarianism to divide people along religious and tribal lines. But why should religion be considered a political matter? Religious matters are between you and your god. Politics is about the provision of roads, water, drugs, in hospitals and schools for children. \n\nCase for unity \n\nTake the road from here, Parliament Buildings, to Republic House. This road is so bad that if a pregnant woman travels on it, I am sure she will have a miscarriage! Now, does that road harm only Catholics and spare Protestants? \n\n Is it a bad road only for Moslems and not for Christians, or for Acholis and not for Baganda? That road is bad and it is bad for everyone. \n\nAll the users of that road should have one common aspiration: to have it repaired. How do you become divided on the basis of religion or tribe if your interests, problems and aspirations are similar? \n\nDon\u2019t you see that people who divide you are only using you for their own interests not connected with that road? They are simply opportunists who have no programme and all they do is work on cheap platforms of division because they have nothing constructive to offer the people. \n\nOur Movement is strong because it has solved the problem of division: we do not tolerate religious and tribal divisions in our Movement, or divisions along party lines such as UPC, DP, UPM and the like. \n\nEveryone is welcome on an equal basis. That is why you find that when our army goes to Buganda, the people there call it amagye gaffe, abaana baffe. When it goes to the West, it Is amahe gaitu, abaana baitu: which means that wherever the NRA goes, it is called \u2018our army, our children\u2019. Recently, Buloba was captured by our army, and the commander in charge of the group was an officer called Okecho. He comes from Pakwach in West Nile. \n\nTherefore, the so-called division between the north and south is only in people\u2019s heads. Those who are still hoping to use it are going to be disappointed. They ought to dig a large grave for such aspirations and bury them. Ma-sindi was captured by our soldiers led by Peter Kerim: he, too, is from West Nile. Dr. Ronald Batta here, who is from Madi, has been our Director of Medical Services for all these years in the bush. \n\n\u2018Angry\u2019 Obote \n\nObote tried to propagate the idea that there was a division between the Bantus and the Nilotics and that if the Bantus took over, the Nilotics would be wiped out. We have, however exposed him. Whenever, we captured soldiers from Ac noli, Lango and elsewhere, we would treat them well and then release them. \n\nObote would be surprised and he would ask: \u201cWere you really captured? Did you see Museveni? Were you really not beaten?\u201d Once we captured the police commander of Masindi, a man called Gala. \n\nI talked to him and another man called Epigo, also from Masindi. When we released them and Epigo got back to Obote, Obote did not like what Epigo had to say: that the National Resistance Army was not a tribal army as the Obote government had been trying to make out. So Obote locked Epigo up in Luzira Maximum Security Prison because he did not want to hear the truth about our Movement and Army.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Moses Kaketo"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Uganda news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Museveni full speech after capturing power January 29, 1986","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"UG","country":"Uganda"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Newz.ug","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"574497720","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Newz.ug","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://newz.ug"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198405032","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:05:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Jay Inslee strode into an auditorium in Olympia with a message for the new subcabinet he formed to help prepare the state for a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. \n \n\u201cThe science is clear that we have in our future a megaquake,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cThe establishment of the subcabinet is our attempt to marshal the resources of the state to have a coordinated resilience plan.\u201d \n \nBut the governor\u2019s rhetoric gave way to some familiar realities in Washington state. The subcabinet has no budget, staff or regulatory authority \u2014 and simply creating it took more than three years, internal records show. The dozen state officials assembled onstage were on loan from their day jobs. And the members are responsible for delivering just one product: a draft of their findings by July. \n      WAITING FOR DISASTER   \nMost of Washington state\u2019s seismic-safety priorities from 30 years ago remain unaddressed or incomplete. A few examples: \n \nSchools: No mandatory seismic evaluation for schools. About 386,000 public-school students \u2014 one of every three enrolled \u2014 live in earthquake-prone areas and attend schools that were built before seismic standards were adopted statewide, according to a Seattle Times analysis. \n \nBuildings: No state requirements or grants to retrofit buildings. At any given moment in Seattle, at least 25,800 people may be inside an old, brick building \u2014 the most vulnerable to earthquakes \u2014 that hasn\u2019t been retrofitted, according to city data. \n \nBridges: The state Department of Transportation has spent almost $200 million retrofitting bridges since 1991, and estimates it will cost well over $1 billion to finish the work. The state has just $6.7 million available for bridge retrofits. \n   \nElected officials over the past three decades have repeatedly directed seismic-safety experts to produce such reports, all of which have called for action to reduce threats to public safety and the state\u2019s economy. But time and again, state politicians have largely ignored recommendations that require money or legislation to see them through, an examination by The Seattle Times has found. \n \nAs a result, Inslee\u2019s new subcabinet will be grappling with issues raised many times before, but which still pose serious risks to the state\u2019s residents. \n \nFive government reports since 1986 have urged Washington\u2019s lawmakers to mandate seismic evaluations of public schools, where thousands of children attend classes in vulnerable buildings . Evaluations remain optional. \n \nState seismic advisers called on the Legislature in 1991 to require that electric and water utilities analyze their earthquake weaknesses. Washington still has no authority to compel the utilities to act. \n \nAnd for at least 25 years, seismic committees have advocated more retrofits for state bridges. With  nearly $200 million spent on the work , funding for the program has slowed to a trickle, even as 11.3 million vehicles a day drive over almost 500 bridges flagged for strengthening. \n \nThe new subcabinet won\u2019t address upgrading schools or protecting coastal communities from tsunamis because the governor narrowed its scope to focus on improving the state\u2019s ability to respond in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. \n \nInslee, in an interview after his speech, said he was committed to the issue but that it would take public and legislative support to make real progress. The Legislature, he noted, is chiefly occupied with satisfying a court order to fully fund basic education for public schools. \n \n\u201cI expect this cabinet to produce a result, which are some proposals and some identified shortfalls that need to be fixed,\u201d he said. \n \nFew states face the kind of catastrophic earthquakes that threaten Washington, and others are investing more to protect their communities. California leads the nation in earthquake risk and in measures to reduce it . \n   \nOregon has moved aggressively in recent years to evaluate and reinforce school buildings and is pressing for additional seismic funds, even though its earthquake risk is 40 percent lower than Washington\u2019s, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \n \nDave Norman, Washington\u2019s state geologist and a 27-year veteran of the Department of Natural Resources, believes that the subcabinet gives momentum to longstanding seismic goals. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s more interest and passion being brought to bear than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \n  \nI\u2019ve been through the Cold War era, the nuclear days, and nothing scares me like this Cascadia.\u201d - Bob Hamlin \n  \nNot everyone shares this optimism. The subcabinet, with no resources of its own, will rely on the state Emergency Management Division, an agency diminished by cuts that have brought its core operating budget down to half what it was a decade ago. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Rep. Gael Tarleton, D-Seattle. She added that instead of spending money to blunt the impact of an earthquake, state officials won\u2019t commit funds until the damage is done. \u201cWe wait for it to happen,\u201d she said. \n   More from the series:   \nMore than 400,000 Washingtonians live in 16 rural counties with emergency-management departments consisting of, at most, the equivalent of one full-time employee. Of these, more than 200,000 live in five counties along the coast that are among the most vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. \n \n\u201cBlue-ribbon committees don\u2019t help me at all. Money helps me,\u201d said Bob Hamlin, who spent the last 17 years as the lone emergency manager for Jefferson County, which spans the Olympic Peninsula. Hamlin, 77, retired in January after a 46-year career. He believes the state isn\u2019t taking the danger of the Cascadia fault seriously enough. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been through the Cold War era, the nuclear days, and nothing scares me like this Cascadia,\u201d he said. \n \u2018It was shocking\u2019  \nSince the late 1980s, scientists have warned policymakers about the threat of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a 700-mile-long offshore fault that has unleashed some of the world\u2019s most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis at intervals as short as 200 years. The most recent one occurred 317 years ago . \n \nAn end-to-end rupture of the Cascadia fault would cause the ground along much of the West Coast to convulse for up to five minutes, tearing apart pipelines, roads and buildings that haven\u2019t been strengthened. A tsunami would slam coastal communities with surges 30 feet high or more, swallowing up anyone unable to reach high ground. The death toll could exceed 10,000, according to federal estimates, and leave communities isolated and without basic needs for weeks or months. \n \nBy 2014, Washingtonians vulnerable to intense ground-shaking from a megaquake numbered 5.4 million \u2014 an increase of 1.6 million people since 1990 , according to a Seattle Times analysis of census and geologic data. \n \nBut as more people settled in Washington\u2019s earthquake danger zone, the state\u2019s financial support for the Emergency Management Division has eroded. The bulk of the agency\u2019s state funding is for responding to disasters, from floods to fires. But state funding for operations \u2014 covering core programs like catastrophic planning and public education \u2014 was $1.6 million in 2016, down from $3.1 million in 2006, budget records show. \n \nWashington\u2019s strategy for responding to a megaquake was crafted inside the division\u2019s headquarters at Camp Murray, near Joint Base Lewis-McChord. There \u2014 at a single cubicle littered with business cards and stacked with binders of disaster plans \u2014 Jim Hutchinson spent the past six years as the only state employee dedicated solely to catastrophic planning. \n \nHutchinson, a Washington native, said he knew little about the Cascadia threat until it became his job to plan for it. \n \n\u201cQuite frankly it was shocking,\u201d said Hutchinson, a former telecom worker and National Guardsman. \u201cIt was so extreme that it takes a while for it to sink in.\u201d \n \nHutchinson\u2019s $71,316 salary, benefits and expenses had been paid by a federal grant. When the grant expired in 2015, the Emergency Management Division sought $178,000 in state funds to fill the void for two years. Without it, officials warned, \u201c Statewide catastrophic planning will slow extensively .\u201d \n \nGov. Inslee included the money in his proposed budget, but the Legislature didn\u2019t. The request went unfulfilled. \n \nThe agency scraped together enough cash to keep Hutchinson, in part by cutting back on travel and assistance to local emergency managers, Emergency Management Division officials said. In 2016, the EMD again warned lawmakers in its budget request that the lack of funds restricted its ability to plan. \n \n\u201cThis has the potential to result in additional fatalities to residents, delay recovery, and cost the state billions of dollars in revenue generation,\u201d the request states. \n \nInslee included $99,000 in his budget to cover the program for one year. Again, the Legislature declined. \n  \n\n  Robert Ezelle, director of emergency management for Washington state, at right, speaks at the first meeting of the Resilient Washington Subcabinet in Olympia on Jan. 17. The subcabinet has no budget, staff or regulatory authority, and the state officials assembled onstage were on loan from their day jobs. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times)  \nHutchinson had been working on a plan for responding to a Cascadia megaquake but was unable to finish it in time for a drill in June that simulated the disaster. An internal analysis completed after the drill rated the state\u2019s readiness as \u201cgrossly inadequate ,\u201d The Times reported in October. \n \nHutchinson retired in December after turning in a draft of his Cascadia plan. \n \nEMD officials say they will hire a replacement despite financial pressures. Since 2015, agency staffers have worked four 10-hour days a week to save on energy costs. \n \nNevertheless, the EMD director, Robert Ezelle, is eager to work with the new subcabinet to address the gaps revealed by the recent drill. \n \n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got some good ammunition coming out of that exercise to gain traction on some of the things we really, truly as a state need to be working on,\u201d he said in December at a meeting of the Washington State Seismic Safety Committee. \n \nIt was the committee\u2019s first full meeting in three years. \n A legacy of inaction  \nWhen Washington\u2019s official earthquake advisory group met in 1985, its members had watched seismic reforms fail over the previous 15 years. The reforms would fail again, they warned, without a mechanism to make them stick. \n \nThe group looked to California, where a government commission focused solely on seismic safety had its own budget and staff. Washington\u2019s experts advocated for the Legislature to create such a commission. \n  \n\n   \n\u201cThe legacy of state-level inaction with respect to seismic safety in Washington state clearly demonstrates the need to significantly enhance the capability of existing agencies,\u201d the Seismic Safety Council wrote in a 1986 report requested by Gov. Booth Gardner. \u201cAn effective risk reduction strategy cannot be carried out by part-time state personnel and advisory committees.\u201d \n \nYet for the last 30 years, that is how Washington state officials have operated. \n \nIn 1991, the state\u2019s seismic advisers delivered another report to the Legislature that called for a range of safeguards, including school-building evaluations, financial incentives to retrofit vulnerable structures and upgrades to transportation and energy networks. They warned that without action, \u201cThere will be deaths, injuries and disruptions that could and should have been prevented.\u201d \n \nWashington\u2019s earthquake advisers were unable to win support for a commission like California\u2019s , which employs a structural engineer, a geologist and a legislative director, among others. Instead, Washington in 1996 created a seismic safety committee made up of state employees and other experts who volunteered their time. \n \nIn 1998, the committee gave the Legislature an update on the incremental progress made on past recommendations like retrofitting bridges and mapping hazardous regions. \n \nBut a committee survey found that a quarter of a million students attended class in seismically weak buildings and that a statewide inventory of such buildings \u201cdoes not exist.\u201d The group also noted that there was no government policy to encourage seismic retrofits and no plan to evaluate utilities. \n \nIn 2001, the Nisqually earthquake caused about $2 billion in damage , putting an exclamation point on the committee\u2019s warnings. \n \n\u201cSchool buildings represent a substantial life safety and injury risk to children in this state,\u201d the committee wrote in a 2003 report that again called for an inventory of structurally weak schools. It proposed criteria for retrofitting incentives, recommended a more aggressive program of bridge strengthening and mandatory seismic assessments for utilities. \n \nBy 2008, when Gov. Chris Gregoire asked the committee to identify gaps in earthquake preparations, its members were disillusioned . After more than two decades, they noted that the only substantial recommendation implemented was adopting modern building codes. \n \n\u201cA committed group of volunteers has done its best to advise the governor,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey have done so without funding or enabling legislation. Their reports have been minimized.\u201d \n \u2018What is needed to get the ball rolling?\u2019  \nWashington\u2019s seismic committee won federal funds in 2010 to draft another seismic-safety analysis, inspired by a San Francisco initiative to become more resilient against earthquakes. \n \nCalled \u201c Resilient Washington ,\u201d the initiative resulted in a 2012 report that estimated how long it would take to restore the state\u2019s power, water and transportation systems to use. It laid out 10 areas for improving seismic safety, including schools , utilities, insurance and critical infrastructure. \n \nIn August 2013, John Schelling, then the state\u2019s lead earthquake-hazards expert, emailed Ezelle, his boss at the Emergency Management Division, to suggest that the governor create a subcabinet to implement the seismic measures. Ezelle agreed. \n \nA year went by with no executive order. Then another. \n \nMajor General Bret Daugherty, Ezelle\u2019s boss and the head of the state\u2019s National Guard, expressed his frustration in a Dec. 1, 2015, email to Inslee\u2019s chief of staff. \n \n\u201cCan we please discuss what is needed to get the ball rolling on the Resilient Washington subcabinet?\u201d Daugherty wrote. Attached to his missive were staffers\u2019 notes about an inquiry from The Times on seismic-safety progress. \n \nIt took almost another year for Inslee to issue his directive authorizing a subcabinet . \n \nMeanwhile, state officials have made no progress on 70 percent of the recommendations in Resilient Washington, according to an EMD internal assessment. And much of what has been achieved was thanks to federal funds, such as a seismic hazard survey for 17 of the state\u2019s 295 school districts, and local funds, like construction of a tsunami-resistant shelter in the Ocosta School District . \n  \nA catastrophic earthquake would be the costliest, and potentially deadliest, natural disaster in US history.\u201d - Emergency Management Division report \n  \nOregon started its own resilience plan after Washington but has moved faster to act on the recommendations. The Legislature in 2015 created a new position, the state resilience officer, with a two-year, $652,000 budget. The veteran emergency manager hired for the job reports directly to the governor. \n \n\u201cThe whole idea is to have somebody that operates at the highest level of government to basically hold the Legislature accountable for making progress on the resilience plan,\u201d said Jay Wilson, chair of Oregon\u2019s Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission . \n \nOregon also has prioritized seismic safety in public schools , identifying 1,100 buildings at high risk and making more than $200 million available for retrofits. Gov. Kate Brown is seeking another $200 million for strengthening schools and buildings that house first-responders, in addition to $32 million in bonds to reinforce water systems. \n \nIn Washington, the top item on the Emergency Management Division\u2019s budget wish list is $100,000 a year through 2021 to pay for a staffer to support the subcabinet\u2019s work. Its second priority is a two-year, $1.5 million public-education campaign urging Washingtonians to prepare for surviving up to two weeks on their own. \n \n\u201cA catastrophic earthquake would be the costliest, and potentially deadliest, natural disaster in US history,\u201d EMD wrote in its request. \u201cWashington currently lacks even the most rudimentary state framework to support long-term community and statewide recovery.\u201d \n \nJim Mullen, who ran the Emergency Management Division for eight years before stepping down in 2013, said he is dismayed by how the crisis of the day has always pushed seismic safety to the back burner. Mullen noted that finding funds for disaster planning probably won\u2019t be a priority until lawmakers comply with a state Supreme Court order to deliver a budget that will fully fund basic education. \n \n\u201cUntil we solve the schools issue, we can\u2019t launch investment in initiatives like seismic safety?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is incredibly, and dangerously, shortsighted.\u201d \n  \n\n  The iconic bridge over Deception Pass is on the state Department of Transportation\u2019s list of bridges that need a seismic retrofit, but work on it has yet to begin.

A first-half strike from Raheem Sterling was matched by Leroy Sané after the break before Yaya Touré curled in a beautiful free-kick in added time. \n \nPep Guardiola, resplendent in a coat of many zips, had opted to play with a youthful front three and there was anticipation from the off that the kids might cut loose for City against a Palace team yet to fully imbibe the Allardyce tonic for defensive incontinence. \n \nRelated: Branislav Ivanovic proves the unlikely star as Chelsea rout Brentford \n \nThe opening exchanges suggested as much, but City failed to make the most of their moments. Sané misconnected with a diving header in the second minute when it would have been easier to score from Sterling\u2019s dinked cross. A minute later and Sterling himself was blocked at the last moment. City claimed four corners in the opening 10 minutes. \n \nAs the game wore on, however, Palace grew into it. With their own unfamiliar line-up, especially in midfield where Lee Chung-yong and Jordon Mutch had been drafted in for rare starts, they were compact but competitive and had two great chances to open the scoring just after the half hour. \n \nBoth came from set-pieces. The first arrived after Mutch cleverly drew a foul from Touré close to the City box, a challenge which also won the Ivorian a booking. Andros Townsend took the kick short and Mutch flicked the ball towards the six-yard box where Christian Benteke was unmarked but could only put his header over the bar. \n \nTwo minutes later and the kick was on the left, 25 yards out. Lee took it and looped it high up in the air. As it came down at the back post, there was Mutch again, attempting a scissor-kick. It did not come off but did bounce around the box before eventually falling in front of James Tomkins who got his shot off and forced Willy Caballero into a diving save. \n \nPalace looked increasingly confident and started to push more men into the City half. That turned out to be their undoing. With two minutes of the half remaining Delph broke up a Palace move. His pass went straight to Jesus who, while not quite miraculously, showed great strength and technique to hold off his marker, spin and slice a pass right through the heart of the high Palace line and onto the onrushing Sterling. The England winger bore down on goal, kept his composure and finished calmly under Wayne Hennessey. \n \nAllardyce took Benteke off at the break, reinforcing suspicions he does not trust the Belgian to deliver the necessary work for his side. On came Loïc Rémy and the Frenchman should have equalised within two minutes. A cross from skipper Joel Ward was only scuffed clear by the City defence, Mutch drove another cross-shot back across goal where Rémy had time and space to drive the volley home. Instead it went over the bar. \n \nRelated: Stewart Downing sends Middlesbrough through with victory over Accrington \n \nAs Selhurst Park suddenly became submerged in hail, City bounced back. Jesus should have done better with a header, Sterling cheekily backheeled the ball just wide of the post and Delph hit a low drive from 25 yards that Hennessey did well to turn wide. \n \nFinally, with 19 minutes remaining, City doubled their lead. Palace allowed David Silva to run with the ball from his own half to the edge of the home penalty area. It was three on three and Silva slipped the ball between two Palace defenders to find Sané, who applied another cool finish to score. . \n \nSané went off with less than 10 minutes to go to a standing ovation from the travelling support and a ready-made replacement in Nolito. Palace, meanwhile, lost £11m signing Jeffrey Schlupp to injury. Those are the breaks in football and there was an air of resignation when, in the second minute of added time, Touré curled the ball into the top corner from 25 yards to wrap up the result. \n \nThis article was written by Paul MacInnes at Selhurst Park, for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 17.21 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester City news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: EPL - Crystal Palace news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Raheem Sterling leads way as Manchester City ease past Crystal Palace","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/manchester-city-fc/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/fa-cup/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/raheem-sterling/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/chelsea-brentford-fa-cup-match-report","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/middlesbrough-accrington-stanley-fa-cup-match-report","https://gu.com/p/5zaec"],"sequenceId":"695198418193","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:50Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/manchester_citys_raheem_sterling_scores_their_first_goal_431581.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

As the decision was announced, cheers broke out in crowds of demonstrators who had gathered at American airports and outside the Brooklyn courthouse where the ruling was issued.\n\nThe order barred US border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the US with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nIt was unclear how quickly the judge\u2019s order might affect people in detention, or whether it would allow others to resume flying.\n\n\u201cRealistically, we don\u2019t even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes,\u201d ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said. \u201cThis order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach US soil.\u201d\n\nVictory!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/uyza3zrQSX\n\n\u2014 ACLU National (@ACLU) January 29, 2017 Source: ACLU National/Twitter\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born US residents now travelling outside the US could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \u201cgreen cards\u201d or other visas. However, an official with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said last night that no green card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump\u2019s order had been prevented from entering the US.\n\nSome foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed on Friday had been detained at US airports and told they were no longer welcome. The DHS official who briefed reporters said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.\n\nIn her three-page order, Judge Donnelly wrote that without the stay \u201cthere will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa holders and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017, executive order.\u201d\n\nJust over a year ago, then Governor \u2013 now Vice President \u2013 Mike Pence said calls to ban Muslims from entering the US were \u201coffensive and unconstitutional\u201d.\n\nSyrian War\n\nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from coming to the US. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the US by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the US refugee programme.\n\nTrump\u2019s order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. Posted by on Sunday, 29 January 2017 Video won\u2019t play? Click here. \n\nThe directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the September 11 hijackers.\n\nAs a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the US, then said he would implement \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for people from countries with significant terror concerns. He told reporters yesterday the order is \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely,\u201d Trump said of the implementation of his order.\n\nThe order sparked protests at several of the nation\u2019s international airports, including New York\u2019s Kennedy and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare, and facilities in Minneapolis and Dallas-Forth Worth. In San Francisco, hundreds blocked the street outside the arrival area of the international terminal. Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \u2018Portland Coffee Is From Yemen\u2019 and chanting anti-Trump slogans.\n\nUS lawmakers and officials around the globe also criticised the move. Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said while Trump is right to focus on border security, the order is \u201ctoo broad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we send a signal to the Middle East that the US sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\u201d Sasse said.\n\nIn Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would stop issuing new visas to US citizens in response to Trump\u2019s ban, but that anyone already with a visa to Iran wouldn\u2019t be turned away.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter yesterday afternoon to say that refugees were welcome in Canada, \u201cregardless of your faith\u201d.\n\nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada\n\n\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017 Source: Justin Trudeau/Twitter\n\nTwo of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the US military. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York\u2019s Kennedy airport on Friday night. Both had been released by Saturday night after their lawyers intervened.\n\nThe government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied.\n\nDiplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump\u2019s order would still be allowed into the US.\n\nThose already in the US with a visa or green card would be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn\u2019t authorised to publicly discuss the details of how Trump\u2019s order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump\u2019s order also directed US officials to review information as needed to fully vet foreigners asking to come to the US and draft a list of countries that don\u2019t provide that information. That left open the possibility that citizens of other countries could also face a travel ban.\n\nThe US may still admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government would continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \u201cprovided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country\u201d.\n\nAmerican-Islamic Relations\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d Lena F Masri, the group\u2019s national litigation director, said. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d\n\nProtesters at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York yesterday \n\nJohn Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations, said the order didn\u2019t address America\u2019s \u201cprimary terrorism-related threat\u201d \u2014 people already in the US who become inspired by what they see on the internet.\n\nTrump\u2019s order drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program, particularly for those from Syria.\n\n\u201cWe are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But, as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programmes as a Trojan Horse to attack us,\u201d House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how many people would be immediately impacted by the non-refugee travel ban. According to the statistics maintained by the Homeland Security Department, about 17,000 students from the seven designated countries were allowed into the US for the 2015-2016 school year.

Essentially an extremely attacking, hard-pressing philosophy, it has met with mixed results lately, but swiftly had Boro on the back foot. \n \n\u201cThey were a difficult team to play against,\u201d said Karanka. \u201cBut Stewart Downing was the best player on the pitch and he deserved his goal.\u201d \n \nDespite Downing\u2019s involvement in virtually all Boro\u2019s better cameos, his side struggled to establish any sort of real tempo. Accordingly, Accrington\u2019s Omar Beckles headed fractionally over the bar before the home frontline had even begun warming up. \n \nNever averse to a spot of rotation, Karanka made seven changes, offering starts to Rudy Gestede and Patrick Bamford in what remained a reasonably strong X1. While the clearly ring rusty Bamford saw a shot fly narrowly off target, Gestede \u2013 the lone striker \u2013 was largely isolated as, all attractive passing and movement, Coleman\u2019s side looked increasingly cohesive. \n \nOne smart visiting manoeuvre left Sean Clare clean through and apparently set to score only for Dimi Konstantopoulos \u2013 enjoying a very rare start in goal \u2013 to spread himself adroitly before saving. \n \nClare proved prominent again when, as half time approached, he escaped down the right and unleashed a highly inviting low cross. Stretching every sinew, Billy Kee \u2013 lucky to escape unpunished after swinging an elbow at his marker Bernardo during an earlier, off the ball contretemps \u2013 was inches from connecting. Tellingly, the interval was greeted by a smattering of boos from the 24,000 crowd. \n \nAs the second half unravelled, and, still, Marek Rodak had barely made a serious save, disillusion mounted. Admittedly, Accrington defended superbly at times, but, for all the visitors\u2019 well-timed interceptions and brave blocks, Boro were horribly low on invention. \n \nKaranka duly replaced the ineffective Viktor Fischer with Adama Traore\u2019s pace, and Downing soon scored. After being cued up by Grant Leadbitter, the former England winger disorientated a couple of markers, manipulated the ball into space, swivelled, and, from just outside the area, sent a high velocity left-foot shot arrowing into the top corner. \n \nMuch as Downing merited his winner, Karanka could still count himself slightly fortunate to avoid a replay after Sean McConville very nearly equalised with a late, diving, header. \n \n\u201cWe made three or four good chances,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cTo only go down to a wonder goal is a testament to how well we played.\u201d \n \nThis article was written by Louise Taylor at the Riverside Stadium, for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 17.06 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Stewart Downing sends Middlesbrough through with victory over Accrington","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/fa-cup/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/middlesbrough-fc/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/fa-cup-photo-essay-accrington-stanley-v-luton-in-the-third-round","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/accrington-stanley/","https://gu.com/p/5zaj5"],"sequenceId":"695198420515","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/middlesbroughs_stewart_downing_celebrates_after_the_game_431599.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) has written and presented more than 50 television and radio documentaries for several channels. \n \nLast year she presented Genius of the Modern World for BBC Four. She has written two best selling books, Helen of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore and The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search of the Good Life. Ms Hughes, 49, lives in west London, with her husband Adrian and two daughters. \n \nHow did your childhood influence your work ethic and attitude towards money? \n \nBoth my parents were professional actors, so I grew up in a household that had no real financial stability. \n \nIt was drilled into me from an early age that nothing is certain and that you have to be incredibly careful and sensible with money. However, if you are lucky enough to have a little bit spare, you should also try to enjoy it. \n \nIt didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t have foreign holidays or smart clothes; it was a happy childhood. I cleaned cars to earn pocket money and worked in the Body Shop on a Saturday (Shenzhen: 002291.SZ - news ) . My brother wrote articles for the local newspaper from a young age. Both of us wanted to be self-supporting as soon as we could be. \n \nHas there been a time in your life when you haven\u2019t known how to pay the bills? \n \nThere hasn\u2019t. I have never ever lived beyond my means. At university in Oxford, where I read Ancient and Modern History, I shared a house with four other girls. \n \nWe worked by candlelight and avoided putting the heating on until it was totally necessary so we could afford the bills. \n \nI also never went to the pub as I just thought that was going to be too expensive and shopped for clothes in charity shops. \n \nI always wanted to be a historian. When I was at Oxford, friends were going for jobs as well-paid lawyers or consultants, but those paths never appealed. Being fulfilled by doing a job that I loved was always a priority. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n John Rutter: 'Money's like petrol. You only notice when the tank is empty'  Sir John Madejski: 'My fortune has been decimated. I lost hundreds of millions'  Richard Whitmore: 'I made £600k on my home. You can't lose with property'  \nDo you remember your first pay packet? \n \nAfter I graduated, I carried on with my academic work, via grants but I often had a market stall on Camden Market selling hand-painted silk to make some cash. \n \nI would possibly make £35 a day in the Eighties and Nineties. It seemed quite a lot back then. \n \nMy first salaried position was in 1992 as director of arts at the Riverside Studios. I think I got about £16,000 a year, but I left after a year. \n \nWhat has been the best-paid part of your career so far? \n \nThat was probably before the big financial crash, around 2004 and 2005, when I had a two-book deal and I was making two big television series a year. \n \nWhat was your most lucrative work? \n \nThe occasional motivational speech gig tends to pay better than the books and television. \n \nSome of the broadcast work I do isn\u2019t very highly paid at all. For some radio and podcast jobs, taking in the preparation time the daily rate can be as low as between £25-£75 a day. \n \nBooks are a slow burner. My latest book, Istanbul, took 10 years to write. Television does pay better. I have turned down a number of celebrity appearances on shows. I would much rather spend time doing work I love or be with my family. \n \nWhat was your best buy? \n \nThe house, which we purchased in London about 20 years ago for around £200,000. It is worth a great deal more now. We chose it in order to live close to my parents, who helped me a great deal with childcare when my daughters were young. \n \nWhat has been your worst business decision? \n \nI don\u2019t want to sound self-congratulatory but I don\u2019t think I have made a worst business decision yet. \n \nAfter writing my book on Socrates, who wasn\u2019t paid for sharing his philosophy with the world, I feel I have his ghost hovering over my shoulders. I get asked on average to do 100 jobs for free a year, some of which I take on \u2013 I feel these are cultivating my soul, if not my bank balance. \n \nAre you more of a saver or a spender? \n \nI am definitely a saver. My daughters are my priority as we are helping them get through university. \n \nBut I do like to splurge in a charity shop. I think I have a suppressed spender in me! \n \nIf I have any spare cash, I occasionally go to a little shop near the British Museum and buy an antiquity for less than £100. I don\u2019t have many, though. I have never been interested in having an extravagant lifestyle. \n \nRead More \n  \nAre you naturally good with money or do you have to work at it? \n \nI would say I was quite good as I have been freelance most of my working life and I\u2019m still solvent. \n \nI don\u2019t move my money to take advantage of better interest rates \u2013 if there were more hours in the day, I would. \n \nWhat\u2019s the most difficult lesson you\u2019ve learnt about money? \n \nI don\u2019t think I have had one. As my father had an agent, I got one pretty early on in my career. \n \nI only take on work that I like to do. I just ask myself: \u201cIs this work worthwhile?\u201d \n \nDo you prefer to pay by debit, credit or cash? \n \nCash \u2013 I usually carry about £40 on me, plus various denominations of foreign currency from my travels. \n \nI bank with Lloyds and use a debit card otherwise. I\u2019ve never owned a credit card. I have never wanted to be in debt. So far, I\u2019ve survived without one but I am considering one for overseas travel emergencies. \n \nWhat are your financial priorities for the next five to 10 years? \n \nMy work life is about to change as I have co-founded a new ethical production company with a very financially astute person. Ninety-nine per cent of the radio and television series I\u2019ve worked on have been my own ideas. \n \nWe are in production on a number of international documentaries. The company has a commitment to produce the best work, by the best people, for the best reasons. It is going to be a very exciting and, hopefully, profitable venture. My role is creative director. \n \nI\u2019ve another couple of non-fiction books lined up with a publishing deal, too. \n \nAre you a good tipper? \n \nYes, about 15pc in taxis. I would happily withhold a tip for bad service, though. \n \nIf there was one thing you could change about the financial world, what would that be? \n \nI think everyone who is involved in the financial world needs to ask themselves a small quiet question in the morning: \u201cIs what I am doing going to be for the greater good?\u201d   \n \nSocrates, Confucius and Buddha all shared the same philosophical ideas \u2013 that wealth in itself is not problematic, but it is if we acquire this at the expense of wisdom and virtue. I think if we followed this philosophy, we would have a robust exciting financial structure to modern society but also one is that is less abusive. \n \nDo you give regularly to charity? \n \nYes, I\u2019m involved in Kids in Museums; Classics for All; Iris, an educational charity; the National Churches Trust and the Church\u2019s Conservation Trust. Plus I happily spend in charity shops, and give regularly to Shelter. \n \nDoes money make you happy, in your opinion? \n \nMoney doesn\u2019t make you happy; anxiety about not having enough money, however, does make you unhappy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Bettany Hughes: 'I worked by candlelight to avoid paying the bills'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

It is providing a significant portion of the funding that will make the Coastal Master Plan a reality. Any honest evaluation of the past, as well as the efforts to protect the future, will conclude that Louisiana\u2019s oil and natural gas industry has always been a partner in building our communities and working together on our coast. \n \nFor decades, Louisiana\u2019s leaders and its residents have understood when the oil and natural gas industry thrives the state thrives \u2013 with more and better paying jobs for hundreds of thousands of working families. \n \nIt is in the best interest of our state\u2019s culture and coast to have a safe, prospering oil and natural gas industry. \n \nA productive oil and natural gas industry creates revenue for Louisiana from royalties and taxes that fill the government coffers and provide the largest stream of consistent funding the state has for working on the coast. \n \nToday, there are dozens of major ongoing conservation projects funded by the industry happening across the coast with business, community, state and federal cooperation. The industry has contributed more than $4 billion to the state\u2019s coastal restoration since 2009, and the oil and natural gas industry will contribute an estimated $200 million a year for the foreseeable future to coastal projects. \n \nCurrently, a partnership between the New Orleans Geological Society and five Louisiana universities is using $200 million in industry data to conduct research of seismic faults along the Louisiana coast. Miles of oyster reefs have been created through cooperative programs between the industry and local communities. The largest private wetlands landowner in the U.S. \u2013 an energy company \u2013 is caring for wetlands extending 120 miles west to east from the Atchafalaya Basin to the Mississippi River. Another energy company planted more than 1 million trees in coastal and marsh lands. \n \nAt the Coastal Protection and Restoration Agency Coastal Master Plan public comment meeting in New Orleans on Jan. 18, a noted geologist reminded the audience that when the pyramids were built in Egypt, Louisiana\u2019s coastline was near Covington. This fact emphasizes that our coast is an evolving natural entity. At the same time, those who are planning and overseeing a comprehensive solution have agreed there are dozens of factors that contribute to the state of Louisiana\u2019s coastline, including the decision to construct levees along the Mississippi River, as well as movements of the earth\u2019s faults. \n \nThe spirit exemplified within the coastal plan is one of unity and collaboration for a common goal. We are all in this together, and it will take the concerted effort from all parties pulling in the same direction to make an impact along Louisiana\u2019s coast. Louisiana cannot afford to single out the group that is already the No. 1 private investor in our coast and the largest employer in our state. \n \nSelectively attacking the industry that represents $3 billion in annual taxes paid to the state and one of every six jobs here tells the thousands of Louisiana-based businesses and hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that the state would rather sue this industry than work with it. \n \nThe best solution is not in a courtroom. It\u2019s working with the best science available, which the industry has, and investing our financial resources, which the industry is doing and has done for decades, into projects that can ensure both a protected coast and a working coast. \n \nMarc Ehrhardt is executive director of the Grow Louisiana Coalition.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Marc Ehrhardt Guest Columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Opinion: Oil industry is doing its part for the coast","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lafourche","zipCode":"70301","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Thibodaux","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Comet","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169668587","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"132"},"name":"Daily Comet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailycomet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198427306","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It says the parish is in a good position to grow and attract jobs in coastal restoration, aviation, food manufacturing and professional services such as engineering, accounting and law. \n \n\"This is a five-to-seven-year strategy, and you can't have a strategy that just ignores oil and gas, agriculture and seafood and the gains the parish has made in the medical field,\" Matt Rookard, TEDA's chief executive officer, told The Courier and Daily Comet in a story published a couple of weeks ago. \"We have a lot of work to do, and it's not going to all happen immediately, but we have a lot of ideas on how to do it.\" \n \nMakes sense to me.  \n \nNow, let's make it happen, right? \n \nPlease forgive that hint of sarcasm in my last sentence, but I have long been skeptical of so-called economic-development efforts, mainly because, at least around here, they rarely produce measurable economic development. To be fair, that is the case in lots of communities. \n \nOurs, as the study notes, faces significant and unique challenges that most others do not. For instance, focus groups cite high insurance costs as a significant deterrent to business growth. Predictions that the Gulf of Mexico will swallow almost half of Terrebonne over the next 30-50 years aren't going to make insurance any cheaper.  \n \nCoastal erosion, sinking land, rising seas and the threat of hurricanes six months of every year won't make it any easier to attract businesses outside the oil industry, which has a vested interest in being close to the Gulf. \n \nFocus groups also cited bad roads, bridges, sewer systems and the other infrastructure that, done well, can enhance not just business but life for everyone, as a challenge. And that won't be easy to fix in a state that stumbles from one financial crisis to the next instead of creating a sustainable plan matches tax dollars with priorities for public services. \n \nBut all is not lost. The plan offers a step-by-step plan aimed at generating new jobs. But making that happen will require somebody to step up and lead, accepting accountability for success or failure. If TEDA is going to lead, its board needs to make that clear to the public. It needs to tell residents how they will measure their own success and that of Rookard and his administration. And it will need to get public buy-in for an agency that I suspect many local residents have never heard of. \n \nFocus groups described a \"perceived inertia\" among decision makers that holds back the area. And that inertia is not limited to government officials but people in lots of leadership roles. \n \n\"To redirect the parish\u2019s trajectory for growth, leadership will need to be proactive and execute its economic development efforts differently,\" the study says. \"It will need to be a champion for long-term investments that will add to the parish\u2019s product and quality of place, as well as ensure that sufficient resources are available to fund such goals.\" \n \nIn essence, the best things the parish can do to attract business are the same kinds of things it can do to make it a better place for the people who already call it home. Better schools, better roads, tax system that addresses real priorities at a reasonable cost, stemming coastal erosion. Even the small stuff, like making the entry points to the parish look a little nicer than someone's messy tool shed, can make a difference. \n \n\"The status quo is not an option,\" the study concludes. \"By taking on actionable and measurable plans to focus its entrepreneurial, retention and attraction efforts, Terrebonne will become more competitive. With added focus, the parish can make huge strides in its economic development efforts and build the community it desires.\" \n \n-- Courier and Daily Comet Executive Editor Keith Magill can be reached at 857-2201 or keith.magill@houmatoday.com.

By 9 p.m., estimates placed the crowd at over 1,000, and they were able to shut down some operations at the airport. \n More than 1,000 people are still at Seattle-Tacoma airport.

The Seattle Times reported that local resident Ibado Ahmed was at the airport to pick up her husband, who was coming to Seattle from Somalia. He was turned away and sent back to Germany, where his flight had originated from. \n\nPort of Seattle commissioners released a joint statement on Saturday expressing disapproval of Trump's order. The commissioners say the order was abrupt, and didn't leave room for preparation. \n\n\"As the operators of this airport, we are deeply concerned that the abrupt nature of the executive order did not allow adequate process for public agencies such as ourselves to provide service that travelers and families expect and deserve,\" the statement read. \"We took it upon ourselves to request a full briefing from Customs and Border Protection to understand how they are addressing this situation.  We respect these hard working federal employees who are under tremendous strain.  However, when we felt that traveler needs were not fully met, the Port of Seattle stepped up.  We started providing private waiting areas for families here at the airport and connecting families to lawyers who can help advocate for their rights and the rights of their loved ones.\" \n\n \nEarlier on Saturday, there was outrage that some Sound Transit light rail trains were skipping the Sea-Tac stop. Transportation leaders are set to meet on Monday to discuss how to handle such situations in the future. \n\n On Monday, leaders from ST and Metro will meet to evaluate and develop a clear protocol moving forward. \n\u2014 Dow Constantine (@kcexec) January 29, 2017  \nAlso on Saturday, Gov. Jay Inslee held a press conference at Sea-Tac pushing back on Trump's order, comparing it to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. \n \nImage via Sea-Tac Airport","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Neal McNamara"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More Than 3,000 Protest Trump Executive Order At Sea-Tac Airport","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"King","zipCode":"98052","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Redmond","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sammamish Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172130534","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sammamish Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sammamish.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/lindseywasson","https://t.co/xA5E4ZXkx4","https://t.co/w6h54h4Y6R","https://twitter.com/pgcornwell/status/825582581970186240","https://twitter.com/SeaTacAirport","https://twitter.com/KIRO7Seattle","https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBanprotest?src=hash","https://t.co/n8426g0Xex","https://twitter.com/GriffKIRO7/status/825583747936317440","https://twitter.com/hashtag/seatacprotest?src=hash","https://t.co/Eo2cO701YP","https://t.co/Df96fS11Pz","https://twitter.com/lindseywasson/status/825591428558450688","https://t.co/s2HoA4GEsi","https://twitter.com/GriffKIRO7/status/825588924101779456","https://twitter.com/kcexec/status/825557411045847041"],"sequenceId":"695198427965","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22906546/20170129/020016/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/seatca_baggage-1485671977-736.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Chelsea manager watched his team ease into the fifth round of the FA Cup at the expense of a Brentford team that did not turn up until the second half and the icing on the cake was provided by Branislav Ivanovic \u2013 the player that he had dropped from the starting line-up. \n \nConte introduced the Chelsea stalwart, whose future at the club looks uncertain, as a 64th-minute substitute and, with his first meaningful involvement, Ivanovic scored his first goal of the season to make it 3-0. He gave the ball to Pedro and rumbled forward in support before getting it back and squeezing a low finish underneath the goalkeeper, Daniel Bentley. \n \nThere was more. Ivanovic got himself into the area towards the end and, when he was taken out by Yoann Barbet, the referee, Michael Oliver, pointed to the penalty spot. Michy Batshuayi scored to round off Chelsea\u2019s 17th win in their past 19 matches in all competitions. \n \nRelated: Wolves stun Liverpool after Richard Stearman kickstarts FA Cup upset \n \nConte made nine changes from the line-up that had beaten Hull City in the Premier League last Sunday \u2013 retaining only Pedro and César Azpilicueta \u2013 but it did not matter. His team still had plenty of cohesion and punch where it mattered, with Pedro outstanding and Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Willian not too far behind. Pedro scored the second \u2013 his eighth of the season \u2013 and also had a hand in the first and third goals. \n \nChelsea took an early lead and what a goal it was \u2013 a beautifully executed free-kick by Willian, which he got to dip sharply after it had cleared the defensive wall. Dean Smith, the Brentford manager, did not look happy at the award of the foul but Lasse Vibe did check Pedro after Chelsea had worked a short corner routine. It was Willian\u2019s seventh goal of the season. \n \nConte\u2019s team made inroads up the right from the first whistle, where Pedro overlapped from the wing-back position to good effect. What a season the Spaniard is having and he scored his team\u2019s second before the midway point of the first half. At that point, the tie looked over. \n \nWillian initiated the move, rolling the ball into Batshuayi, who threaded a pass forward for Loftus-Cheek. The young attacking midfielder did not look to get a touch but Pedro had hared up in anticipation of being involved and he was. His touch was instant and the low, stabbed finish was too good for Bentley. Pedro did not have much room in which to work but he only needs a yard at present. \n \nIt was men against boys in the first half and the only surprise was that Chelsea did not rack up more goals. They created the chances, with Loftus-Cheek, who played to the left of Batshuayi, the central striker, in marauding mood. Loftus-Cheek showed his power and a deft touch, at times, too. He had three sightings of goal before the interval and from two of them, he forced Bentley into smart saves. \n \nBentley managed to deny Batshuayi at close quarters following a goalmouth scramble on 27 minutes, scruffily halting the ball on his own line and he later touched Cesc Fàbregas\u2019s low shot from distance past the post. Chelsea could also point to a scuffed John Terry effort when the captain was well placed and a swing-and-a-miss from Batshuayi, who promptly buried his head in his hands. Brentford could not wait for the half-time whistle. Their only flicker before that came when Barbet speared a shot from a tight angle into Asmir Begovic\u2019s midriff. \n \nBrentford brought 6,000 fans and they found their voices when their team began the second half with a little more hustle. It felt as though Smith had to have had some strong words during the interval and the response was good. The men in red and white stripes finally got into the faces of their opponents and there was a better balance to the tie for a while. \n \nThe visitors had chances, as well \u2013 two presentable ones, the first immediately after the break. It was teed up by Ryan Woods for Vibe, who had got the better of Terry. Begovic was off his line to claw the ball away from him. \n \nThe second came on 63 minutes and it followed a piece of skill inside the penalty area from Nico Yennaris that Dennis Bergkamp would have been proud of. Yennaris pirouetted away from Terry and Azpilicueta to open up the opportunity but again Begovic was out quickly to block. \n \nLoftus-Cheek had hit the crossbar after excellent work from Willian on 58 minutes while he went close following another surge into the area before Ivanovic made his push for the headlines. \n \nThis article was written by David Hytner at Stamford Bridge, for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 17.14 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Chelsea news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Branislav Ivanovic proves the unlikely star as Chelsea rout Brentford","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/chelsea-fc/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/fa-cup/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/brentford-fc/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/branislav-ivanovic/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/liverpool-wolverhampton-wanderers-fa-cup-match-report","https://gu.com/p/5zatd"],"sequenceId":"695198428424","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/chelseas_branislav_ivanovic_celebrates_scoring_their_third_goal_431590.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 19 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198437281","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In recent years, interest has grown in a pedestrian parade, promenading down Main Street from the vicinity of the bus station and feed store down Main toward Barrow. \n \nIt's the Krewe of Tradition, the project of John Sonnier, Shannon Eaton and other Houma locals seeking to bring back costuming and masking as it was in the '60s. \n \nEaton, Sonnier and their supporters urge adults and supervised children to costume as individuals or groups and march about noon Fat Tuesday in a mini-parade from the feed store near Main and Barataria to Courthouse Square and back to Main and Grinage in front of Le Petit Theatre. \n \nLast year there were judges and prizes for originality with preference to hand-made outfits. No entry fee and no advance registration was needed. Even now, walking krewe supporters meet weekly to discuss plans and costumes, and to craft hand-made souvenir throws to hand out during their grand promenade. The next meeting is 6-8 p.m. Feb. 5 at the Waterlife Museum, 7910 Park Ave., Houma. \n \nEaton says those intending to make their own throws should bring supplies and craft tools. Further information may be available at the Krewe of Tradition Facebook page. \n \nEvent tours: Operators of at least two area businesses that either arrange tours or provide van-type transportation have emailed information about such operations. Group trips to events like \"The Lion King\" in New Orleans, for example. Details as soon as I can sort it all out. \n \nBeware of \u201corphans\u201d! \u201cGreeting from Juliet,\u201d began an unsolicited email last week, purportedly from an orphan needing my help to recover and spend an inheritance. \u201cMy names are Juliet writing from Bishop Robert orphanage home and there is this money which my late parents told me about before the fatal accident which took their lives. \n \n\u201cAlso I have the contact of my father lawyer you can contact him because I call him with the orphanage phone and I told him about this decision I want to make. \n \n\u201cI want you to contact me through this mail address...\u201d (I omit it to avoid potential complications.) \u201cPlease help me recover the money, I am not in good condition here anymore. God bless you. I hope to hear from you soon.\u201d \n \nThe big mystery is how this sweet internet scammer learned of my expertise at recovering fortunes of this kind. \n \nComedy coming: Le Petit Theatre's next production, \"Waste Mismanagement,\" does not open until late March, but director Sue Peace and producer Danielle Marchive were supervising early rehearsals last week. Jeanne Scott and Reggie Pontiff were repeating the same short scene, seeking Peace's satisfaction. You will be amused; in time. \n \nNew museum: Organizer Margie Scoby is excited about the opening on Feb. 4 of the Finding Our Roots African American Museum, 918 Roussel St., Houma. Watch for details. \n \nCook-off? Still no details on that downtown Houma chili cook-off set for March 11. To register a team, contact Anne Picou at apicou@tpcg.org. The poster suggests there will be entertainment for non-cooks attending the public event. \n \nResponding?

It was an important game for us and we couldn't deliver. \n \n\"I was asked if it is the low point of my Liverpool time until now and I don't know if it is. \n \n\"But if it is, it's a perfect point to turn around because it is not possible to go lower. It is absolutely right that it feels bad. \n \n\"I don't feel that the players let me down. I am responsible for the line up. I saw them training and I thought that is the line up. \n \n\"I am responsible for the bad things. We could have played better. Each boy could have played better. For each single performance there is an explanation. \n \n\"I am never too harsh in criticism and you should not be too emotional.\" \n \nDamning \n \nLineker was particularly damning of Klopp's approach to the FA Cup, a competition Liverpool have won seven times in their illustrious history. \n \n\"Don't get Klopp playing his reserves with no European football,\" said Lineker via Twitter. \n \n\"Shows a lack of knowledge of the depth in English football and respect.\" \n \nLiverpool's hopes of winning silverware this season are in tatters. \n \nBut Klopp refused to be critical of any of his youngsters, or the handful of senior players who lined up alongside them. \n \n\"We played a Championship team at Derby in the (League) cup and they had not a percentage of a chance. That is not years ago,\" Klopp said. \n \n\"It is not right to judge people in a very bad moment. It is not about not wanting, it is about not getting the right players in the transfer window. \n \n\"We have to go through the history of Liverpool, better sides lost against worse sides. We know what we have to change, only we have to show it. \n \n\"I cannot explain every single thing of today. I don't look for excuses.

But when the money was not forthcoming, she engaged with her employer and even agreed to lower her fee. \n \nStill the party failed to honour the agreement. Months passed. Eventually, Bolani decided to go to court. \n \nThe case will be heard at a later date. \n \nThe ANC first denied having had any dealings with her, despite party general manager Ignatius Jacobs admitting that she had volunteered to work for the party in the lead-up to the polls. \n \nIt then said it was dealing with the matter, whatever that means. \n \nWith 2019 national and provincial elections looming, it is time for the ANC to ask itself if it can continue to treat Bolani and other small, mostly black, businesses in this manner. \n \nAs is evident already, the loss of the Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay metros has affected service providers who may have received their jobs through connections with the ANC top brass. \n \nShould the ANC lose control of more provinces, it will also lose the patronage it was able to dish out to businesses amenable to the party. Such businesses are unlikely to survive. \n \nFollow me on Twitter @DumisaneLubisi","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dumisane Lubisi"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"What will ANC\u2019s quid pro quo be after 2019?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"News24","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"269196883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2123"},"name":"News24","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news24.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/DumisaneLubisi"],"sequenceId":"695198443086","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Traditional centers of demand are being overtaken by fast-growing emerging markets. The energy mix is shifting, driven by technological improvements and environmental concerns. More than ever, our industry needs to adapt to meet those changing energy needs,\u201d said Bob Dudley, BP group chief executive. \n \nAccording to the 2017 edition of the BP Energy Outlook , published today, global demand for energy is expected to increase by around 30% between 2015 and 2035, an average growth of 1.3% per year. However, this growth in energy demand is significantly lower than the 3.4% per year rise expected in global GDP, reflecting improved energy efficiency driven by technology improvements and environmental concerns. \n \nThe Outlook looks at long-term energy trends and develops projections for world energy markets over the next two decades. The 2017 edition was launched today in London by Spencer Dale, BP\u2019s group chief economist, and Bob Dudley, group chief executive. \n \nMain energy sources \n \nWhile non-fossil fuels are expected to account for half of the growth in energy supplies over the next 20 years, the Outlook projects that oil and gas, together with coal, will remain the main source of energy powering the world economy, accounting for more than 75% of total energy supply in 2035, compared with 86% in 2015. \n \nOil demand grows at an average rate of 0.7% a year, although this is expected to slow gradually over the period. The transport sector continues to consume most of the world\u2019s oil with its share of global demand remaining close to 60% in 2035. However, non-combusted use of oil, particularly in petrochemicals, takes over as the main source of growth for oil demand by the early 2030s. \n \n\u201cThe possibility that the most important source of growth in oil demand in the 2030s won\u2019t be to power cars or trucks or planes, but rather used as an input into other products, such as plastics and fabrics, is quite a change from the past,\u201d said Spencer Dale. \n \nGas grows more quickly than either oil or coal over the Outlook , with demand growing an average 1.6% a year. Its share of primary energy overtakes coal to be the second-largest fuel source by 2035. Shale gas production accounts for two-thirds of the increase in gas supplies, led by growth in the US. LNG growth, driven by increasing supplies in Australia and the US, is expected to lead to a globally integrated gas market anchored by US gas prices. \n \nCoal consumption is projected to peak in the mid-2020s, largely driven by China\u2019s move towards cleaner, lower-carbon fuels. India is the largest growth market for coal, with its share of world coal demand doubling from around 10% in 2015 to 20%in 2035. \n \nRenewables are projected to be the fastest growing fuel source, growing at an average rate of 7.6% per year, quadrupling over the Outlook, driven by increasing competitiveness of both solar and wind . China is the largest source of growth for renewables over the next 20 years, adding more renewable power than the EU and US combined.     \n \nEmerging themes \n \nThe Outlook highlights a number of questions and uncertainties raised by the energy transition that is underway. \n \nOil: changing dynamics of demand and supply \n \nAll of the demand growth for oil in the period to 2035 comes from emerging markets, with China accounting for half. \n \nThe transport sector accounts for around two-thirds of the growth in oil demand.  Within that, oil demand for cars increases by around 4 million barrels per day underpinned by a doubling in the global car fleet.  The number of electric cars is assumed to increase from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million in 2035 (around 5% of the global car fleet).  The Energy Outlook constructs two illustrative scenarios to consider the impact of the broader mobility revolution affecting the car market, including autonomous cars, car sharing and ride-pooling. \n \n\u201cThe impact of electric cars, together with other aspects of the mobility revolution, such as self-driving cars, car sharing and ride pooling, is one of the key uncertainties surrounding the long-term outlook for oil\u201d said Spencer Dale. \n \nThe slowing rate of oil demand growth is contrasted by the abundance of global oil resources.  The Energy Outlook speculates that the abundance of oil may cause low-cost producers, such as Middle East OPEC, Russia and the US, to use their competitive advantage to increase their market share at the expense of higher-cost producers. \n \nGas: the emergence of a global market \n \nGas continues to gain share from coal, helped by energy policies that encourage the shift in both industry and power generation. The main growth comes from China, Middle East and the US. \n \nIn China, growth in gas consumption outstrips domestic production, so that by 2035 imported gas comprises nearly 40% of total consumption, up from 30% in 2015. In Europe, the share of imports rises from around 50% in 2015 to over 80% by 2035. \n \nThe Outlook expects LNG supplies to grow rapidly to account for over half of traded gas by 2035.  This increase is led by supplies from the US, Australia and Africa. Around a third of this growth occurs over the next four years as series of projects currently under development come on-stream. \n \nCarbon emissions: the need for further policy action \n \nCarbon emissions are projected to grow at less than a third of the rate seen in the past 20 years, by an average of 0.6% per year versus 2.1% per year, reflecting gains in energy efficiency and the changing fuel mix. \n \nIf achieved, it would be the slowest rate of emissions growth for any 20-year period since records began in 1965. However, carbon emissions from energy use in the base case are still projected to grow throughout the period, by about 13%. This is far in excess of the IEA\u2019s 450 Scenario, which suggests that carbon emissions need to fall by around 30% by 2035 to have a good chance of achieving the goals set out in Paris.

The aim was to utilise the area above the canals, saving the government the cost, time and inconvenience associated with land acquisition. \n \n\n \nGujarat alone has a canal network of 80,000 km. Using even 30% of this network for canal-top solar projects, according to GSECL estimates , 18,000 MW of power could be produced in just Gujarat\u2013almost equal to the current coal-based installed capacity of Delhi, Rajasthan and Telangana\u2013and 90,000 acres of land, or twice the size of Kolkata, could be saved. \n \nIn other words, installing solar-panels over 30% of Gujarat\u2019s canals could be used to meet nearly a fifth of India\u2019s solar power targets by 2022. \n \nCurrently, about 100 MW of solar installations atop and besides canals are either approved or under construction in eight Indian states. Government subsidies are limited to public-sector companies that own canals or canal banks, but, if successful, private-sector involvement is inevitable. \n \nSolar power is important to India\u2019s future electricity needs \n \nCoal generates over 75% of India\u2019s electricity and is among the cheapest energy sources available, IndiaSpend reported in May 2015. \n \nWith over 300 million Indians without reliable energy, and industrial demand growing, the need for coal-fired electricity is estimated to increase three times by 2030, with consequent environmental impacts. \n \nBut in talking about what he calls the \u201c seven horses of energy \u201d\u2013coal, nuclear, hydro, gas, solar, wind and biogas\u2013Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared that India\u2019s efforts should increasingly move towards the latter three. \n \nThe real potential in a sunny country to replace fossil fuels is solar: India has a renewable-energy potential of about 895 GW, of which 750 GW is solar, as IndiaSpend reported in February 2015. \n \nBy 2022, solar energy could achieve grid-parity in India, meaning it would cost the same as other sources of electricity\u2013although some reports suggest this might happen by 2018. That is the year, as another IndiaSpend report said, renewable-energy sector, primarily solar, could generate 1 million jobs\u2013over 400,000 already exist, according to a 2016 status report by Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, a global, multi-stakeholder network based out of Paris. \n \nSolar power plants can be built faster than either coal, gas or nuclear power plants. Further, in the decade ending 2014, solar installed capacity went up from 2.6 GW to 139 GW, a jump of 50 times over the initial capacity in just ten years, largely because of falling costs and improving solar-cell technology. \n \nThe critical issue around solar installations in India is space, as IndiaSpend reported in May 2015. That is where the nation\u2019s canals come in. \n \nCanal-top solar power is most efficient, has longer life and saves water \n \nThe power output of ground-mounted solar panels decreases at a rate of 1% every year for the first 10 years. However, panels mounted on Chandrasan\u2019s canal showed no degradation and power generated stayed stable over the past three years, according to research conducted by the Gujarat Energy Research and Management Institute (GERMI), a research institution promoted by the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Ltd, which is a Govt of India undertaking. \n \n\n \nAs the midday sun beats down relentlessly, solar panels fixed at an angle atop a 750 m long length of canal in Chandrasan village, Mehsana district, in India\u2019s sunniest state of Gujarat, work quietly to produce power while saving evaporation of water that runs beneath. \n \n\u201cNot only do they perform more efficiently, but because we can assume that the generated electricity is utilised in nearby areas, the transmission losses of (normally) 4% and distribution losses of 3% are avoided,\u201d said Sagarkumar Agravat, head of GERMI\u2019s solar research and development. \n \nApart from this, since the panels are placed on top of water, they are cooled from below, which also increases their efficiency and enhances output by 2.5-5%. \n \n\n \nThe panels placed at at optimum angle over canal water. When they are cooled from below, their efficiency increases and enhances output by 2.5-5%. \n \nEssentially, this means the panels will last longer than 25 years, which is the average lifespan of a ground-mounted solar panel, while producing more power due to increased efficiency. \n \nThe study concluded that canal-top installations outperform both traditional ground- mounted solar installations and systems on canal banks. \n \nSource: Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Limited data, shared with IndiaSpend; *since April 2012. Ground-mounted panels studied at Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University, near Gandhinagar. \n \nCanal-top panels, by absorbing heat, help reduce water evaporation. A 1-MW canal-top plant can save the evaporation of up to 9 million litres of water per year, according to a GSECL estimate shared with IndiaSpend , saving enough to provide 2,500 households with 10 litres of water every day for a year. As more canals are covered, the savings increase. \n \nThe use of solar energy also stops the emission of close to 1.28 million metric tonnes per year of carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas, according to this report . This is roughly equivalent to the annual energy use of 110,000 American households saved from a 1 MW plant. \n \nWhy solar power is important to India\u2019s climate-change commitments \n \nBy 2030, global greenhouse-gas emissions are expected to reach 54-56 giga-tonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2eq)\u2013far exceeding the level of 42 required to limit global warming to 2℃ by the year 2100, according to data from the Emissions Gap Report 2016, compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme every year. \n \nThe Paris Agreement , which aims to hold temperature rise to below 2°C by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels, came into force on November 4, 2016, barely a month after India ratified the treaty on October 2, 2016. \n \nThe 2016 Emissions Gap Report also states that despite full implementation of all the Paris pledges submitted by countries under their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), global temperatures are still set to rise to levels ranging from 2.9°C to 3.4°C. This means that countries must now go beyond their intended contributions if they hope to arrest global warming. \n \nAs part of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, India has committed to source 40% of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. By October 2016, renewable installations amounted to nearly 15% of the installed energy capacity, according to the Central Electricity Authority. \n \nSource: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ; *As on October 31, 2016 \n \nIndia now faces the challenge of adding a close to 91 GW of solar-power capacity over the next six years to reach its target of 100 GW of solar energy by 2022. In a land-starved country, finding space to install solar plants will be a challenge. This is where India\u2019s network of irrigation canals could be useful. \n \n\n \nA board outside the 10 MW canal-top solar plant in Vadodara shows the daily export of power from the plant as well reduction in emissions. \n \nAs land availability falls, canal-top solar prospects look bright \n \nIn 2012, when the first canal-top project was commissioned, the land required for a 1 MW solar installation was about 5 acres. By 2015, with advances in technology, this was down to 4 acres, Jani said. \n \nGiven that the population density of India during the same period (2015) was over 3 times that of China at 441 people per sq km, and over 7.5 times the world average of 56.6 people per sq km, land availability will inhibit solar-energy expansions. \n \nSpace-saving designs, such as Gujarat\u2019s canal-top installations and floating solar panels (in Kolkata), could ensure future renewables growth. \n \nHowever, capital costs of canal-top installations are, currently, higher than their ground- mounted counterparts. The 1-MW solar plant at Chandrasan (in 2012) cost Rs. 17.73 crore, 77.3% higher than the benchmark cost issued by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. \n \nA 10-MW canal-top solar plant at Vadodara (in 2015) cost about 47.6% higher than the benchmark cost, according to Neeraj Kuldeep, a research analyst with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a not-for-profit research institution based in New Delhi. \n \n\u201cWe should be looking at this (canal-top projects) as research, and not expect it to be commercially viable immediately,\u201d Kuldeep said. Since canal sizes vary, every installation must be custom-built. That may mean construction delays and cost overruns. \n \nThe supports on canal-top panels must be galvanised\u2013given a protective layer of zinc\u2013more thickly than normal because the water beneath increases rusting risks, according to this field study . As technology advances, costs could reduce. \n \n\u201cTwo to three years down the line, once the technology and manufacturing processes are in place, the auctioning of such projects will create competition in the market and might reduce tariffs drastically,\u201d Kuldeep added. \n \nTo push states to construct more canal solar projects, the central government provides subsidies of Rs 3 crore per MW or 30% of the project cost, whichever is lower, for canal-top projects, and Rs 1.5 crore per MW or 30% of the project, whichever is lower, for canal-bank projects, according to this 2014 notification . \n \n\n\n \nThe canal-top panels next to their ground-mounted counter parts, used to check effect of cooling and enhanced efficiency of the panels atop the canal. \n \nCurrently, the scheme is only open to government entities including government power and irrigation companies that own canal networks. \n \nUnder the scheme , state governments are developing 50 MW of canal-top projects and 50 MW of canal-bank projects. \n \nCanal Solar Projects Under Development \n \nSource: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy \n \n\u201cWhen we started, nobody from the private sector wanted to get involved in the project because of the risks and experimental nature,\u201d said GSECL spokesperson Jani. \u201cSo, we decided to pursue it ourselves.\u201d But if canal-top or canal-bank solar plants have to be scaled, private sector involvement is inevitable. \n \nThe field study of Chandrasan project suggested ways to support private-sector entry, including rights to use canals, right of way, cutting red tape while issuing licenses, and long-term power-purchase agreements (PPAs) that consider the price differential with ground-mounted panels. \n \nDo canal-top or canal-bank projects have environmental impacts? \n \nThe canals over which the solar panels are installed have already gone through environmental impact assessments. Therefore, according to officials, the new constructions over the canal or on the sides are exempt from further assessments. \n \nThe construction of the project at Chandrasan was done in under six months. Permissions and approvals were received quickly and work was fast-tracked because there was no land to acquire or environmental impacts to consider, Jani said. \n \nHowever, these solar projects require levelling of the canal banks and shadow-free areas above panels. If canals are tree-lined, this would involve cutting trees. Construction could also contaminate the water in the canal, said Kuldeep. \u201cEnvironmental clearances are important because this is a separate construction that is being undertaken,\u201d he said. \n \n( Patil is an analyst with IndiaSpend.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Renewable energy news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Utilities news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Coal industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Canal-top solar power plants: One example of Narendra Modi\u2019s Gujarat Model that\u2019s working well","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"232003819","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"Firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.DNST","http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gujarat-not-rajasthan-is-the-sunniest-state-isro-study/story-hgbL7IR4rtobsP9HhsD88H.html","http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/India/1/INDIA%20INDC%20TO%20UNFCCC.pdf","http://www.narendramodi.in/gujarat-dedicates-india%E2%80%99s-first-canal-top-solar-power-project-to-the-nation-4442","https://vibrantgujarat.com/","http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/akshay-urja/july-august-2016/EN/20-23.pdf","http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/installedcapacity/2016/installed_capacity-12.pdf","http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/why-india-must-submit-to-king-coal-for-now-54081","http://www.urbanemissions.info/india-power-plants","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modi-pushes-for-affordable-renewable-energy-for-all-739783","http://www.indiaspend.com/budget-2015-modis-moment-of-reckoning/renewable-energy-prepares-for-great-budget-push-45051","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Solar-power-tariff-will-reach-grid-parity-by-2017-18-India-Ratings/articleshow/48188434.cms","http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/million-renewable-energy-jobs-predicted-for-india-2022-2022","http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_KeyFindings_en_10.pdf","http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/activities/Topical%20Reports/REN21_10yr.pdf","http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/coal-kills-indians-can-the-sun-power-india-32906","http://www.indiaspend.com/wp-content/uploads/chandrasan_620.jpg","http://www.indiaspend.com/wp-content/uploads/angle_620.jpg","http://www.ddugjy.gov.in/mis/portal/field_study.html","http://www.aashe.org/blog/what-does-one-ton-co2-really-mean","http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=27088&ArticleID=36295","https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/paris_agreement_english_.pdf","https://uneplive.unep.org/media/docs/theme/13/Emissions_Gap_Report_2016.pdf","http://www4.unfccc.int/Submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/India/1/INDIA%20INDC%20TO%20UNFCCC.pdf","http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/installedcapacity/2016/installed_capacity-10.pdf","http://pib.nic.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=28","http://www.indiaspend.com/wp-content/uploads/emissions_620.jpg","http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/floating-solar-power-plant-in-kolkata/article6747770.ece","http://www.mnre.gov.in/file-manager/grid-solar/Administrative-Approval-reg-Pilot-cum-Demonstration-Project-for-Canal-Bank-Canal-Top-Solar-PV-Projects%20.pdf","http://www.indiaspend.com/wp-content/uploads/ctcb_620.jpg","http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/UserFiles/Canal-Top-Scheme-Monitoring-Template.pdf"],"sequenceId":"695198445951","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Each year still operates according to a theme and this year's theme is \"Decades of Glamour.\" \n \nSun Met attendees have therefore been given 9 different decades of glamour to choose from and we at ZAlebs came up with some suggestions for who we'd like to see pulling off each decade. Take a look  \n \n1920's - The Great Gatsby  \n \nThis era is characterised by the fact that women started to wear more comfortable clothing such as shorter skirts and trousers. They also started to exercise a bit more freedom (both in how they looked and behaved). The Great Gatsby narrative was also set in this era and it was all about opulence and glamour.  \n \nAs such, we'd like to see Khanya Mkhangisa (who usually goes uber-sexy with her looks), Nomuzi Mabena and Minnie Dlamini pull off looks from this era.  \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions - 1920s sunmet.co.za   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1920s   \n1930's - Vintage  \n \nVintage is NOT the second hand stuff sold to you in Braamfontein every weekend, nor is it that cool skirt you stole from your mom's suitcase of stuff that she doesn't wear anymore.  \n \nVintage clothing refers to anything produced around the 1920s and a few decades after that. So that cool dress you got from your grandma may count.  \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions - 1930s sunmet.co.za   \nVintage looks often have an a-line design or feature lace in their patterns like the looks worn below by Boity, Leigh Ann Williams and K Naomi.  \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1930s instagram.com   \n1940's - Retro \n \nShort for retrospective fashion, retro takes a look back at the fashion of the West's war years with a-line dresses, shoulder pads, white gloves and shades of grey to reflect the mood of the era. Three piece suits were also still a vibe for the fellas.  The celebs we'd like to see in looks from this decade of glamour are Katlego Maboe, Dineo Moeketsi and her boo Solo (who loves suits) as well as (with Brandon in tow). \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1940's sunmet.co.za   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1940s instagram.com   \n1950's - Rockabillies /Sophia Town \n \nThis era was all about polka dots and frocks paired with wing-tip eyeliner and a red lip. The local beauties we'd love to see rock this are Roxy Burger, Mbali Nkosi and .   \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions - 1950s sunmet.co.za   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions - 1950s instagram.com   \n1960s - Flower Power  \n \nIt's all about bright colours, big hair and bold patterns for this decade. We think the likes of Thuli Pongolo, Linda Mtoba, Amanda Du-Pont, Loot Love, Thando Thabethe and could really work looks from this decade.   \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1960s sunmet.co.za   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1960s instagram.com   \n1970s - Disco  \n \nThis is a self explanatory look - big/super long hair, metallic and reflective fabrics, and just overall drama so who better to rock this look than some of SA's biggest divas? Bonang, , SK Khoza and possibly Gail Mabalane. Ok, that last one may not be a diva but she's so damn gorgeous that we'd love to see her pull off a super long wig paired with a jumpsuit a la Cher, circa 1970.  \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions - 1970s sunmet.co.za   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1970s instagram.com   \n1980's - Glam Rock \n \nRock n Roll was all about the lifestyle in this era and naturally, fashion started to play a big role in this lifestyle. We'd love to see Maps Maponyane is some guy liner and leather pants, Jay Anstey in a strappy sexy leather number with some wild hair and AKA in a full on Micheal Jackson vibe.  \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1980s sunmet.co.za   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1980s instagram.com   \n1990's - Denim \n \nAlthough Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake wore that iconic denim look in the early 2000's, denim was a fabric characteristic of the 90's and the likes of Shane Eagle and LeAnne Dlamini need look no further than Brit and Justin for inspiration.  \n   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1990s sunmet.co.za   © Provided by Kagiso New Media Proprietary Limited sunmet fashion suggestions 1990s instagram.com   \n2000s - Modern Fashion  \n \nWe are in the fastest evolving era of them all and as such, I can't think of one look that is characteristic of the time.

Pete Ricketts and Ken Stinson. Her donor list also includes several Omaha construction and development-related companies.\n\nStothert said her $1.5 million fundraising total since the 2013 election exceeds her campaign\u2019s budget for the entire election. But she said she\u2019s not going to stop fundraising.\n\n\u201cI think it shows a lot of support, and I\u2019m very grateful for the people that donated to my campaign,\u201d she said.\n\nMello said he expects to spend about $1 million overall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go still in this campaign, and we\u2019re working hard every single day to expand our support,\u201d he said.\n\nOf the money he\u2019s raised, almost $190,000 was carried over from his legislative campaign committee.\n\nMello said his support from the business community is an endorsement of his leadership style, saying donors are drawn to his consensus-building.\n\nBut Stothert said Mello\u2019s donors are simply an indication that she\u2019s had to say no to people \u2014 even potential donors \u2014 during her four years in office.\n\nAdkins, the political science professor, noted that there are still several months to go before the May 9 election.\n\nMello\u2019s business support \u201cdemonstrates that there is some interest in the business community in seeing a change in the mayor,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cHow much of an interest there is, we\u2019re still going to have to see. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the point yet where we really know that.\u201d\n\nAdkins said donors don\u2019t like to give money to those who don\u2019t have a chance to win, so Mello\u2019s fundraising shows that donors believe he\u2019s a quality challenger.\n\nThe fundraising totals are good for Stothert too, Adkins said. He said it\u2019s a good sign for her that she\u2019s amassed a war chest of more than $890,000.\n\n\u201cIf an incumbent can raise a lot of money and they don\u2019t have to spend it, that\u2019s a pretty good sign,\u201d he said.\n\nThe campaigns\u2019 2016 year-end reports are due to be made public Tuesday, but the campaigns provided their figures to The World-Herald last week. Stothert filed her report Saturday.\n\nStothert\u2019s report includes all of her donations for the past year.\n\nDuring 2016, Mello ended his legislative campaign committee and formed a new committee for mayoral election fundraising.\n\nMany of Mello\u2019s top donors last year were Republican business leaders who have had high-profile clashes with Stothert.\n\nHe received $25,000 each from Omaha Performing Arts Chairman John Gottschalk and local businessman Dana Bradford.\n\nThere are no limits on the amount of campaign contributions in Nebraska state and local political races.\n\nBradford, executive chairman of Waitt Brands, declined to say why he donated to Mello.\n\nGottschalk, a former publisher of The World-Herald, said it\u2019s a contested election and he thinks Mello deserves support.\n\n\u201cAll the money is essentially to put him in a position where he\u2019d be competitive,\u201d Gottschalk said.\n\nHe declined to elaborate or say why he preferred Mello over Stothert.\n\nOther big-name businessman donors to Mello include Mike Yanney, who gave $16,000 and is the co-finance chair of the campaign, and Mike Cassling, who gave $5,000.\n\nA handful of donors gave to both, including Walter Scott, chairman emeritus of Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Inc., and Rod Yates and Frank Krejci, who are behind the potential redevelopment of Crossroads Mall.\n\nIn a statement, Yanney said he decided to support Mello to bring a new leadership style to City Hall.\n\nHe said Mello is \u201ca proven leader who has built consensus to pass balanced budgets and landmark legislation around economic development initiatives and public-private partnerships in the Nebraska Legislature.\u201d\n\nYanney, founder and chairman emeritus of the Burlington Capital Group, had previously donated to Mello\u2019s legislative campaigns. He did not return a phone message last week.\n\nMello said he attributes the support to \u201cour record of tackling big issues in the Legislature and helping make significant progress on economic development and public-private partnerships. That\u2019s given my candidacy much more broad appeal than people realize.\u201d\n\nStothert, though, attributed that support to the fact that she had denied requests from many of those business leaders.\n\nIn particular, regarding Gottschalk, Bradford, Cassling and Yanney, Stothert said she\u2019s had to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d and tell them no.\n\n\u201cWhen I made those decisions it was always in the best interest of the Omaha taxpayers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of leadership.\u201d\n\nParticular disputes include:\n\n» Gottschalk was the chairman of OPA last year when the performing arts group asked the city to acquire three buildings near the Holland Performing Arts Center. That land would go to the arts group for future expansion, and the group would turn over a nearby parking lot to HDR Inc. for the company to build a new downtown headquarters.\n\nStothert agreed to direct the city to buy the buildings. But she declined to tear down the century-old buildings in order to make room for the expansion, which would have been unpopular with preservation groups and others.\n\nThe arts group backed out of its request for the buildings, and the deal to bring HDR downtown eventually fell apart. The company\u2019s headquarters will be in Aksarben Village instead.\n\n» Bradford served as the chairman of the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority, a nonprofit that oversees the city-owned CenturyLink Center and TD Ameritrade Park. Stothert was highly critical of MECA under Bradford\u2019s tenure, saying the group needed to release more information to the city about the facilities\u2019 operations. (Bradford gave Stothert\u2019s campaign $5,000 in 2013 after she took office.)\n\n» Cassling is a former top donor to Stothert, giving her $33,000 between 2012 and 2014. He heads an initiative to bring a multisport complex to the Omaha area. The facility was initially planned to be located in Tranquility Park. That deal fell apart, at least partly, Stothert said, because the group asked for $20 million in city money. The group pulled out of Omaha and later decided to build in La Vista. Cassling, who also serves on the OPA board, did not return a phone message last week.\n\n» Yanney\u2019s daughter, Lisa Roskens, is involved in the multisport project. Yanney and his wife, Gail, also led a campaign to raise money for what is now the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. As a council member, Stothert voted against a 3 percent tax on tobacco sales across the city to help fund the center, but the City Council ultimately approved the tax.\n\nStothert said she\u2019s received donations from well-known Democrats, including developer Jay Noddle and restaurateur Willy Theisen, both MECA board members, as well as John Kotouc, executive chairman of American National Bank.\n\nNoddle gave $10,000, according to her report, Kotouc gave $5,000, and Theisen gave $2,500.\n\nShe also received a $2,500 contribution from David Slosburg, another board member of OPA.\n\nMello said Kotouc gave his campaign $1,000 this month, which is after the deadline for this campaign finance report.\n\nAbout Mello\u2019s Republican donors, Stothert said: \u201cSome people aren\u2019t used to being told no. It\u2019s much easier to say yes. I still think the right answer was no in these cases. If they\u2019re angry about it, so be it.\u201d\n\nSaid Mello: \u201cI\u2019m the leading challenger who has a vision for the city, running against a mayor with no vision.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Local government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Omaha's Stothert-Mello mayoral race looks to be competitive, costly","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bannock","zipCode":"83201","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pocatello","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KPVI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169711429","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"KPVI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kpvi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198449140","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kpvi.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/87/a87f84fd-534f-51b2-98ec-0e23b952a46a/588d967abf71b.image.jpg?resize=300%2C452"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kpvi.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/87/a87f84fd-534f-51b2-98ec-0e23b952a46a/588d967abf71b.image.jpg?resize=418%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

And all would be subject to a 20 percent import tax proposed by the Trump administration last week as a means of paying for a border wall between the two nations.\n\nLike many in both countries, however, Jacobo wasn\u2019t quite sure how taxing imported goods to be sold to his U.S. consumers would add up to making Mexico and Mexican consumers pay for the wall, a campaign promise of President Donald Trump.\n\nRather than burdening Mexico, Jacobo said, such a tax collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would end up being passed on to wholesalers in the United States, then to U.S. retailers and ultimately to his consumers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any other price increase,\u201d said Jacobo, whose parents started the family grocery store 40 years ago. \u201cYou have to pass it on to the customer, or what\u2019s the point of being here?\u201d\n\nThe White House said last week that a 20 percent border tax on imports from Mexico is one method the Trump administration is considering to equalize a $60 billion trade deficit and to pay for a barrier between the two nations to control the entry of illegal immigrants, drugs and guns.\n\nA White House spokesman refused to detail exactly how taxing goods coming into the country \u2014 taxes surely to be passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher retail prices \u2014 would generate revenue from Mexico\u2019s government or consumers for the construction of a wall.\n\nSean Spicer, the spokesman, later appeared to backtrack, telling reporters that the tax was \u201cone idea\u201d to pay for the wall and that his intent was not to \u201croll out\u201d a new policy. Not all Republicans seemed to be on board, either: U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., posted on Twitter that \u201cTariffs are a tax on American families.\u201d Colleague Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called talk of an import tax \u201cmucho sad.\u201d\n\nSome economists last week also were scratching their heads at the idea. They included University of Nebraska at Omaha economist and professor Christopher Decker.\n\n\u201cUnless I\u2019m missing something, I\u2019m not quite sure how that works,\u201d Decker said. \u201cIf imports dry up as a result of the increase in tax, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of tax revenue.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, if imports from Mexico remain high because consumers are willing to pay higher prices for valued goods, the people paying those higher prices are U.S. consumers. Instead of Mexico paying for the wall, Decker said, Americans who buy Mexican-made goods would be paying for the wall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s backwards,\u201d Decker said. \u201cThat confounds me a little bit.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just foodstuffs that are affected \u2014 many automobiles, some under American nameplates such as Chevrolet and Dodge \u2014 are assembled in Mexico. Presumably they also would be slapped with a 20 percent import tax as they made their way into the U.S \u2014 if automakers didn\u2019t find somewhere else to make the cars.\n\nThere apparently is some hope that threat of a tariff, or tax, on imports to the U.S. from Mexico could spur carmakers to bring some production back to the U.S.\n\nDennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers, generally expressed support for Trump\u2019s idea of tariffs on Mexican imports, according to news reports after the November election.\n\nSuch support was in short supply among agricultural interests in the Midlands: Farmers and others connected to the ag industry said they had much to lose if talk of an import tax ignited a full-on trade war.\n\nMexico is Nebraska\u2019s second-largest trading partner, after Canada, with $1.2 billion in trade in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nMidlands ag folks were crystal clear Friday when they said they do not favor any U.S. trade policy that will lead Mexico to retaliate with punitive border levies of its own that might cut deeply into the ability of Nebraska and Iowa farmers to sell their grain profitably south of the border.\n\n\u201cAny disruption of export markets would result in continued downward pressure on farm incomes and farm financial health,\u201d said Steve Nelson, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.\n\n\u201cAgriculture exports account for roughly one-third of farm income,\u201d Nelson said, \u201cmaking trade critical to agriculture. Any actions jeopardizing Nebraska\u2019s ability to access international markets is of great concern to our members.\u201d\n\nThe leading categories are the usual suspects: processed food and grain. Mexico is the third-largest consumer of all U.S. agriculture goods, the second-largest consumer of U.S. corn, third of U.S. soybeans and fourth of U.S. beef. Nebraska, in turn, ranks in the top five nationally in the production of each, as does Iowa in corn and soybeans.\n\nMajor corporations with a stake in Mexico are monitoring the situation closely. In Omaha, that means Union Pacific Railroad, employer of 8,000 in Nebraska. The second-largest freight railroad in the United States, about 11 percent of U.P.\u2019s volume is tied to Mexico. The company serves all six of the rail crossings between the United States and Mexico.\n\n\u201cA big chunk is vehicles and vehicle parts going back and forth,\u201d Union Pacific marketing chief Beth Whited said in a conference call with analysts and investors this month.\n\nDaniel Sherman, a Wall Street transportation-industry analyst for St. Louis-based wealth adviser Edward Jones, said he doesn\u2019t see any long-term threat to Union Pacific from the Mexican standoff because, politics and rhetoric aside, there are people on both sides of the border with their heads on straight. And that means, Sherman said, a long-term agreement wherein both sides prosper because it is not in anyone\u2019s best interest for anything but.\n\n\u201cI see the current dust-up as the start of a long drawn-out negotiation process that likely ends better than it will look in the middle,\u201d Sherman said in an interview. \u201cThe reason it ends better is because both sides realize that each is benefiting in a major way from the trade between our two countries.\u201d\n\nOn the same conference call earlier this month, U.P. Chief Executive Lance Fritz said the economies of the two countries are inextricably tied.\n\n\u201cIt is our perception that the United States is tightly woven with our trading partners,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cOur consumers benefit greatly from free and open trade.\u201d\n\nSuch \u201cfree and open trade\u201d is generally considered to be that in which neither trading partner levies import taxes at the border, fees known as tariffs. Fritz said free trade benefits the United States by allowing imports of goods that can be produced more cheaply overseas than domestically.\n\nFree trade advocates say it also opens up exports, encouraging technological and productivity advances in U.S. manufacturing, and the concomitant job growth.\n\nThe opposite trading philosophy is known as \u201cprotectionism,\u201d in which hefty tariffs are levied at the border to make imported goods more expensive than those manufactured domestically, a strategy designed to protect domestic agriculture, industries and jobs from foreign competition.\n\nFor the Midwest, it is the ag portion that resounds the loudest. Corn is selling for less than half the $8 a bushel record seen in 2012, farm debt is up and land prices are declining.\n\n\u201cMexico has been an important and growing market for raw and processed agricultural goods,\u201d said John Campbell of Omaha investment bank Ocean Park Advisers, whose work includes commodities analysis. \u201cA trade war with them when farmers are already in a fragile financial situation would be disastrous for rural America.\u201d\n\nBack in South Omaha, Tony Vega\u2019s Plaza Latina at 4938 S. 24th St. carries a wide range of goods, including Mexican-made cowboy boots costing up to $850 a pair. Customers will balk at a 20 percent increase and may bargain down the price, cutting into the store\u2019s earnings.\n\nThe tax option is another negative message from the Trump administration, said Vega, who helps local people with travel plans and finding doctors or lawyers in Omaha. There\u2019s a fear that the federal government will track down people who aren\u2019t legal residents.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is we want to be the best citizens we can be, respect the law, respect everything,\u201d Vega said. \u201cWe must be good neighbors. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Mexico is our third-largest goods trading partner with $531 billion in total (two-way) goods trade during 2015, the last year with statistics available through the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nMexico is the United States\u2019 second-largest export partner, and it ranks third in U.S. agricultural products received at $18 billion.\n\nTop export categories (in billions)\n\n1.

A white bandana shot through with swirls and skulls held Haddy's riot of dark curls off his face as he worked. One blob of the CelluClay compound became a jaw, another brows. Then, a nose and lips. A face took shape, as did the skills of girls and guys watching him in Mississippi University for Women's brightly-lit scene shop. This was the opening night of a two-day workshop in puppetry and sculpting.  \n \nHaddy is a special effects artist who gained a following as a contestant on Seasons Two and Five of \"Face Off,\" the Syfy Channel's reality television show. It pits special effects artists in competition through elaborate weekly challenges. The West Virginia native was Season Two's runner-up and Fan Favorite. He returned for Season Five, \"Vets vs. Rookies,\" and had a guest spot in Season Eight. Momentum from the show allowed him to step away from his role as a high school media and special effects teacher to pursue his art full-time.  \n \n\"God finally opened this door, and I was just gonna spring through it when he did,\" Haddy said.   \n \nIllusion   \n \nComing of age, Haddy was mesmerized by the Audrey II puppet in \"Little Shop of Horrors,\" obsessed with Jack Nicholson's makeup as The Joker, and entranced by the \"Star Wars\" saga's visual imagery. Films like \"The Dark Crystal\" and \"Labyrinth\" fueled a fascination with puppetry. In the work of Tim Burton, he saw how makeup, puppeteering and costuming intertwine to create mystery and magic. Haddy was hooked on a world in which anything was possible through the power of special effects, imaginative cosmetics and visionary puppetry. That played out in his workshop, as students moved from the scene shop to the costume room and later the makeup mirrors.   \n \n\"I wanted to get across to them that they are all interrelated disciplines,\" Haddy said. \"I think my favorite thing is to combine them into the creation of something completely unique.\"  \n \nPuppetry in particular brought him back to Columbus this past week. His first workshop at The W more than a decade ago imparted skills that helped students make animal masks for a production of \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.\" Some of those masks are still proudly displayed today in Cromwell Communication Center on campus.   \n \n\"Workshops like this, taught by talented professionals, are an invaluable resource to our students, giving them practical training that will be useful not just during their time in college, but in their professional careers as well,\" said David Carter, chair of the MUW Department of Theatre. \"Students who took Robert's workshop when he first did it here 12 years ago, are still using what they've learned to this day. That includes me!\"  \n \nCarter expects skills picked up in this week's training will be useful in the department's upcoming \"The Stinky Cheese Man,\" produced in coordination with the Columbus Arts Council's Young People's Artist Series. That will be presented for area schools Feb. 23-24, with a matinee for the public at 2 p.m. Feb. 25 at Rent Auditorium.  \n \nPuppets and purpose   \n \nInitial thoughts of puppetry may conjure up marionettes, limbs dancing on ascending wires or strings. That is certainly one form. But in Haddy's world, think more along the lines of \"Shrek the Musical,\" E.T., Yoda, Audrey II and \"War Horse.\" Manipulated by puppeteers, inanimate objects become storytellers through their actions, gestures and spoken words.   \n \n\"Most puppets should be as light as possible,\" Haddy told students as he cut lengths of PVC pipe to form the spine, shoulders, arms and legs of a Bunraku puppet in the scene shop. Bunraku is a form of traditional Japanese theater.   \n \n\"The more weight you add to it, the more strain you put on your puppeteer,\" he continued. \"I like puppets. Puppetry combines creation and performance.\"  \n \nLike Carter, William \"Peppy\" Biddy was in the audience. Biddy is the Department of Theatre's director of graduate studies.  \n \n\"The art of puppetry has been used as part of the storytelling tradition for centuries, and every culture has their own style and version,\" he said later. Interest in puppetry has been invigorated by contemporary shows such as \"The Lion King,\" \"Avenue Q\" and many films, inspiring younger generations.   \n \nFor Theatre majors like Ashley Vinson of Holly Springs, Haddy's tutelage exposed her to other art forms.  \n \n\"What I took away from the workshop is that anything can be done with practice, work and determination to get better at a craft,\" Vinson said.   \n \nHaddy remembers what it was like to be a \"student\" himself, learning the crafts from mentors like Tony Gardner and Chet Zar at Alterian Studios in California.   \n \n\"They were all in that shop together in the late '90s period,\" he recalled. \"I was very young and wide-eyed about everything. I was just like a sponge, soaking everything up.\"  \n \nOne of the nicest results of \"Face Off,\" he added, was encountering Gardner later at a major makeup convention.  \n \n\"I got to say to him that so much of what you guys taught me carried me through that entire show.\"  \n \nGet inspired   \n \nHaddy's current focus is finalizing plans to open a full-service effects shop in Charleston, West Virginia. He expects to shoot a reality show pilot around the experience of getting it open and functional.   \n \nFans may often find him at conventions where he's big into cosplay -- the practice of appearing as a character from a movie, book or video game. Haddy is also a distributor for Paasche airbrushes. (\"I've always said an airbrush makes a monkey look like it can paint -- and I like bananas, so there you go!\") Airbrushes create a soft, natural blend and speed up the makeup or painting process. He's designed his own signature brush, The Shadow, in collaboration with Paasche.   \n \nThe effects artist continues to pass on his skills through outlets like The W workshop. One can't expect to turn someone into a Rick Baker or Jim Henson in a two-hour workshop, he said, mentioning the Academy Award-winning special effects designer and the Mississippi-born Muppets creator. But what he can do is give people tools and instruction -- demonstrate materials, skills and techniques and hopefully light a fire.  \n \n\"If I can just light that fire and make you want to take the next step ... I can show you what's possible, but you have to take the leap yourself.\"  \n \nONLINE:   \n rjhaddy.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"A little magic: A reality show veteran shares skills behind the illusions","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lowndes","zipCode":"39703","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbus","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Commercial Dispatch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169731648","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"942"},"name":"Commercial Dispatch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cdispatch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198449500","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Raees was already a well-researched story by two journalists, but Rahul wanted to give it a spin to make it more than just a niche movie. I normally play more urban characters. It was interesting for me to go into this space to play a character which is within my repertoire, but still a little different. I have never played this kind of a small-town and earthy character. I found it very intriguing how bootleggers in the \u201980s and \u201990s bypassed restrictions. We have studied a lot of cases for this film and it\u2019s in a very Narcos and Breaking Bad space. \n \nDo you enjoy gangster movies? \n \nI like some gangster movies, but I am not crazy about them. I like Narcos. I liked The Godfather while I was growing up. I have never done a gangster movie, so to speak. But this was interesting as it has a touch of reality. Some of these were real case studies. \n \nDo your recent choice of films such as Fan, Dear Zindagi and now Raees, indicate a shift? \n \nNo. This is just coincidental that these three films released last year. I have never shifted from where I am. I have always done movies like this. Now, people look at the time period and say, \u201cOh, this is what he is doing\u201d. We are very quick to judge and analyse. I have been here for so long that people have forgotten my last 15 years during which I did Baazigar, Darr, Ashoka, Paheli, Swades and My Name is Khan. I have always tried to do a mix if it is available. If it is not, then you have to do what you have to do. It is a job. In my mind, I have done semi-commercial or middle-of-the-road movies like Chalte Chalte and Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani. I have failed very often trying to do different things. Then I try to do a more popular film by making an event film like Dilwale, Happy New Year, Ra.One or Chennai Express. \n \nShah Rukh In His Gangster Avatar Has The Audience Charmed  \n \nI had finished Happy New Year and shooting for Raees was supposed to start. But I was injured and we had to postpone the film. Fan was scheduled to release even before Dilwale, but we realised that the VFX would take 11 months and it got delayed. Dear Zindagi was a commitment I had made to Gauri Shinde three years ago, since I had loved the story. Normally, I try to make a movie in the popular space and a second one which can say new things within my scheme of thinking as an actor. It is by chance that these three movies came out within a year. \n\n \nA recent blog said you have sent out a \u2018brave message\u2019 by playing Muslim characters in three back-to-back films. And before that, I played 55 Hindu characters. \n   \nThough the premise of Fan was great, do you think it suffered from the post-interval curse? \n \nWe did not sit down and analyse the second half. It was an expensive film and we tried to have a wider reach. We have been wanting to make this film for seven-eight years and waited till we worked out the VFX. Maybe, what went wrong in the film is when Gaurav starts asking : \u2018Ek baar sorry keh de.\u2019 I could be completely wrong, but at this point you don\u2019t know who to go with \u2014 you may think the star should have given in. Suppose he did say sorry, would Gaurav start watching his films and loving him back? We should have retained the fact that this fan takes being shunned by the star very angrily. I do all my film with lots of love and care. It was quite a schizophrenic film, but Fan was extremely close to my heart. For Maneesh (Sharma, director) and Adi (Chopra, producer), it was a brave film. I am always disappointed when I let down people. So many people wanted to be entertained by the film. It will take me some time to get over this. \n \n © Provided by Screen  Has music taken a backseat in your films now? \n \nIt depends on the genre and the filmmaker. You can\u2019t have that in a move like Fan. If I have to keep on putting songs like Gerua in every film, there will be another set of fans who will believe that he keeps putting the same kind of music in his films. Happy New Year had an over-the-top kind of score, Jabra Fan was an interesting track too. In Raees, though, you can\u2019t put a lot of singing and dancing. \n \nHow much of a conflict is it for you to stick to popular parameters while doing \u2018realistic\u2019 movie like Raees? \n \nIt is not easy at all. Rahul wanted to make Raees in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt either of the two genres (realistic and commercial cinema). If I have to make a popular movie, I will go all out and make a Happy New Year. I believe every movie has its own space. You can\u2019t popularize Dear Zindagi by putting two songs of mine. That\u2019s silly and uneducated. In Happy New Year, you can put as many songs as you like and flaunt six-packs. We did not try to commercialize Fan, but the attempt was to have cat-and-mouse-like chase sequences to give the audience an adrenaline rush. Of course, it neither made space for critical acclaim or popular cinema. \n \nOf late, you have been sporting your salt-and-pepper beard with panache. \n \nEven in my upcoming film, directed by Imtiaz Ali, where I play a Punjabi character, I sport a beard because Imtiaz wanted it. If my next film demands me to be clean-shaven or bald, I would go for that look. \n \nSo, you are saying these are not attempts to look closer to your age? \n \nYou can put this as a headline: Shamelessly, I will keep playing a 25-year-old. Are you trying to figure out if I am settling into my age now? No. I am completely unsettled about it. Growing a beard does not make me older. It makes me sexier. I am doing it only for a film. I am shooting 400 days a year. So I am always in a hairstyle and look that the role demands. The look also won\u2019t be a reflection of what my state of mind is. \n   \nAbRam has been running around Mehboob Studio throughout the day. How often does he accompany you? \n \nSince Mehboob Studio is close to home, he drops in when I am here. Also, Gauri had to meet someone outside Mumbai today. There are so many lovely girls from the marketing and publicity teams here. He knows them and is fond of them. There are some cocks and hens roaming in the studio premises, he loves playing with them. Since he has not joined a formal school yet, he can accompany me. \n  © IANS  \nAfter Meryl Streep\u2019s fiery speech at the Golden Globe awards, there was a lot of talk about Indian celebrities, especially film personalities, not speaking up. \n \nAfter Meryl Streep\u2019s speech, asking me why Indian actors are not doing the same is weird. It is like asking me suddenly why I am not playing golf like Tiger Woods. I appreciate what she said and think it was very brave of her to say that in an event organised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Our actors do speak. So do our actresses, filmmakers, producers and journalists. \n \nBut the bottom-line is, you\u2019ve got to speak to people who understand what you are saying. More than the platform Streep used for speaking, she had the platform where people understood what she said... Like I have said before, journalists are not used to stardom \u2014 theirs as well as celebrities\u2019. Suddenly, everybody looks better, does better make-up and the anchor is the star of every show. The editor is the star of every snippet. Everybody writes an article with a picture. Everybody is trying to lose weight, look nice. When I was seven years into stardom, I used to behave like this. \n \nI am waiting for media persons to get over their wonderful, newly-gained stardom. I am friends with most of them and really want to ask them: why do you want to join the bandwagon of faceless people on social media who just want to say a thing and become famous? You don\u2019t need to do that. You used to present the point of view of people, so that I can take your opinion, other people\u2019s opinion, and decide what\u2019s happening around the world. You are the first source of knowledge about what\u2019s happening... \n \nWhy would you say that I wish Indian actors spoke like this (Streep)? Can I say I wish Indian journalists presented me like that too? Is that fair? Give me a platform where you present my point of view, not as part of the agenda you have in your storyline. I would speak \u2014 I always did, I always will.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Shamelessly, I will keep playing a 25-year-old: Shah Rukh Khan","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MSN South Africa","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"491300065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1946"},"name":"MSN South Africa","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.msn.com","publisher":"Microsoft Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198449834","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million.

The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2750","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Penrith","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"St Marys Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346753050","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"St Marys Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stmarysstar.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198455177","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(1:01) \n  2:33 AM ET   \nOAKLAND, Calif. -- There has been something a little off with Stephen Curry this season. \n \nHis numbers surely aren't anything to be ashamed of considering that he's playing with four All-Stars, but that electrifying zest from a year ago hasn't been present on a consistent basis. \n \nShots he usually makes and acrobatic layups he typically pulls off have repeatedly and unexpectedly come up short far too often this season. \n \nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr acknowledged part of the issue was Curry trying too hard to incorporate Kevin Durant into the offensive fold. Even though this is Durant's first season with the Warriors, he also noticed Curry wasn't himself in the first 30 or so games. \n \nIt prompted Durant to engage in a series of routine chats with Curry over the next few weeks. These conversations took place at practices, games and while away from the game. Durant's message was direct and simple: Get back to being yourself, and I'll adapt. \n Stephen Curry had that old swagger back on Saturday, torching the Clippers for 43 points.  Ben Margot/AP Photo \n\"I just said to him, 'Don't worry about me,'\" Durant told ESPN of his ongoing dialogue with Curry. \"I said, 'Just play your game. I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out around you. You're the engine of this team, and I know that. I'm not trying to come over and feel like everything just revolves around me. Just do you, man. I'm going to play around you. I've played this game long enough. I know how to score. I know how to find the ball. Just go out there and play your game,' and that's what he's been doing.\" \n \nOn Saturday, Kerr said he read something online recently in which the writer asked, \"Is Steph gonna Steph?\" Curry torched the Los Angeles Clippers for 43 points on 15-of-23 shooting, 9-of-15 from long distance and added nine rebounds and six assists in 29 minutes. \n \nGolden State won handily, 144-98 at Oracle Arena. Curry did not play in the fourth quarter. \n \n\"Whatever [Steph gonna Steph] means, I think that's what happened,\" Kerr said. \n \nThe back-to-back MVP was back at his cheat-code, video-game-playing self that was reminiscent of his 2015-16 campaign. When he let it fly Saturday, it found the bottom of the net. It got to the point where you knew that once the ball left his hands, three more points would automatically be added. \n \nHe even launched a 51-foot half-court shot that beat the buzzer to end the first half. It was his first 40-plus-foot jumper of the season. He made four of them last season. \n \nCurry wasn't overthinking the game. That zestfulness was back. He danced all evening following the swishing of his treys. He was just being himself, doing exactly what Durant has been asking of him. \n  \nCheck out the team site for more game coverage \n  \nCheck out the team site for more game coverage \n \n\"For lack of a better term, he said I need to get in my bag and be aggressive,\" Curry told ESPN of Durant's message. \"That back-and-forth dialogue is where you build chemistry and camaraderie to get through the season. You understand what each other needs to hear. It was not a come-to-Jesus meeting; it's just being locked in, observing what's going on and having each other's back. You need that encouragement along the way.\" \n \nCurry said Durant didn't have to reach out and encourage him, but he's glad he did. \n  \n\"It didn't hurt,\" he said to ESPN. \"I feel like I'm self-motivated enough to figure it out, but along the way if you get in your own head, you need an outside perspective of what other people see, especially a guy that invests a lot in the game just like I do. It didn't hurt, for sure. That's what we're going to need going forward as well.\" \n \nDurant has been careful about not stepping on toes. He said adaptability is one of his greatest traits. He wants his teammates to play to their strengths, and if anyone must sacrifice, he's willing to do so. \n \nHe's seen enough sacrificing from Curry, and he's going to continuously urge his point guard to just be \"Steph.\" \n \n\"I think the whole season he's been having an impact on the game that is kind of different from last year where he maybe made 10 or 11 3s in the game. But this year he's still making the right plays in pick-and-roll, drawing three or four guys and kicking out,\" Durant said to ESPN. \"But then tonight, you see he gets hot so quick, and that's not a coincidence. That's just from him playing the right way. I want him to be himself.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"With Kevin Durant's backing, Stephen Curry returns to starry form","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"ESPN.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"ESPN.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer","Basketball"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.espn.go.com","publisher":"ESPN, Inc"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry","http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors","http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant","http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers","http://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=400900128","http://www.nba.com/warriors","http://www.nba.com/clippers"],"sequenceId":"695198459109","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
