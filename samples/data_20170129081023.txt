Why is that? \n \n\u201cOn offense, just generally speaking, there are more things that can go wrong than can on the defensive side of the ball,\u201d Theismann said in a telephone interview. \n \nHe won the Super Bowl in 1983 and lost it the following year after having directed Washington to a then-record 541 points in the regular season. \n \nOne of his Redskins\u2019 NFC East rivals back then were the New York Giants, where Belichick was the defensive coordinator during the 1985-90 seasons. \n \n\u201cA lot of offenses go through one or two players, and so a defense \u2014 and Bill is great at this \u2014 will focus on a particular player or a particular concept and that\u2019s where they will make sure to stop the opponent,\u201d Theismann said. \n \n\u201cYou can\u2019t really do the same thing on offense and say, \u2018Who do we want to go after?\u2019 It\u2019s tough to pick out one person. You\u2019re not going to isolate on a particular linebacker or a corner. There is just less susceptibility to that on defense.\u201d \n \nIn New England\u2019s 36-17 victory over Pittsburgh in the AFC title game last weekend, for example, the Patriots made sure to limit what Steelers star receiver Antonio Brown did. \n \nHis catches amounted to only 77 yards, with no TDs. \n \n\u201cBill basically uses common sense: \u2018If you have one player who\u2019s really good, let\u2019s see how you play without him.\u2019 They weren\u2019t going to allow Antonio Brown to make plays. They said, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to bump him at the line, put somebody over the top, and you\u2019re going to have to make plays with the other nine players.\u2019 If a defense can limit 20-25 percent of an offense by taking one individual away from it, the pendulum swings to the defensive side,\u201d Theismann said. \n \n\u201cIn this Super Bowl,\u201d he added, \u201cJulio Jones is going to get the bulk of the attention.\u201d \n \nMake no mistake: This is a versatile Falcons offense overseen by coordinator Kyle Shanahan, who is expected to be hired to run the San Francisco 49ers after this season ends and whose father Mike was the head coach of two Super Bowl champions with the Denver Broncos. \n \nRyan spread out his 38 TD passes to a league-record 13 receivers. Jones is the best of the bunch, but Mohamed Sanu, Taylor Gabriel and running backs Devonta Freeman (who ran for more than 1,000 yards and caught 54 passes) and Tevin Coleman (more than 500 yards rushing, more than 400 receiving) need to be accounted for, too. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s not one thing that you can point out and say, \u2018Stop Julio Jones. Stop Sanu. Stop the running game,\u2019\u201d Patriots linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower said. \n \nOr as Belichick put it: \u201cEvery guy that gets the ball can score a touchdown from 80 yards away or more.\u201d \n \nThe Falcons (13-5) scored at least 30 points in 13 of their 18 games this season, including the playoffs, reaching 40 a half-dozen times. During their current six-game winning streak, they never scored fewer than 33. \n \n\u201cWe know that they\u2019re the cream of the crop, offensively,\u201d Patriots cornerback Logan Ryan said. \u201cAnd for us, we feel like we\u2019re that, defensively.\u201d \n \nThe Patriots (16-2) allowed more than 25 points only once in their 18 games, a 31-24 loss to Seattle in November. Since then, they\u2019ve won nine games in a row, never trailing at any moment in their past seven. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s the best defense that we\u2019ve seen in the NFL this year. The numbers show it, and watch the film and you see exactly why their numbers are the way they are,\u201d Shanahan said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HOWARD FENDRICH The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Washington Redskins news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Super Bowl LI: Top D (Patriots) usually beats top O (Falcons) in Super Bowl","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202479741","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/b2/9b2b50bb-b805-5e7c-9785-313906d5d65c/588bda1acfd04.image.jpg?resize=300%2C219"}],"video":[]}}

Castor improved to 21-8-2, lowered his goals against average to 2.06 and raised his save percentage to .914 one night after being pulled early in the first period. \n \n\"I kind of had an idea of what they like to do after talking to (Keenan Suthers) before the shootout,\" Castor said of his teammate who began the season with the Lumberjacks. \"Fortunately, Svechnikov shot it right into my glove, and Adams missed the net. It was a little lucky, but sometimes you have to have a little luck to win. \n \n\"It's pretty tough, letting in three goals on four shots, but there's nothing you can do about it once it's happened. I knew I had to come out and have a good game tonight, and thankfully the guys in front of me had a great game. I knew I had more than that, and I knew our team had more than what we showed in the first five minutes (Friday), so I wasn't too worried about how we'd respond.\" \n \nDubuque improved to 24-10-3 for 51 points and maintained sole possession of second place in the Eastern Conference, two points ahead of Muskegon (23-12-3, 49 points). \n \nThe teams evenly split the four-game season series, which featured four one-goal games and shootout games on the final two nights. The Lumberjacks took Friday night\u2019s game, 4-3, in a shootout. \n \nOne night after surrendering three goals on five shots in the first 5 minutes, the Saints started considerably better. Dubuque\u2019s Michael Boyle dropped the gloves with Matt Steeves just 9 seconds into the game, and the Saints tightened defensively to hold the Lumberjacks without a shot for the first 8:05. \n \nRegen Cavanagh staked the Saints to a 1-0 lead at the 11:54 mark. Austin Rueschhoff won a faceoff back to Patrick Kudla, who slid the puck along the blue line to defense partner Jacob Semik. Cavanagh drove to the net and deposited Semik\u2019s backdoor pass under goalie Adam Brizgala for his seventh goal of the season. \n \n\"It really started with Boyle having that absolutely huge fight right off the draw, because that gave the boys a lot of momentum,\" Cavanagh said. \"I can't take credit for my goal. Rueschhoff had a great faceoff win to Kuddy, and Semik had unbelievable vision to pretty much put it right on my tape. It was a great team effort. \n \n\"We came out flat (Friday) night. We saw what we did wrong and wanted to make sure that didn't happen again.\" \n \nDubuque finished with a 15-4 advantage in first-period shots. The Lumberjacks generated more offense in the second period, when they outshot the Saints, 10-4, but neither team scored despite two power plays each. \n \nMuskegon tied the game with 6:32 remaining in regulation while enjoying a 5-on-3 power play. Andrei Svechnikov wired a one-timer from the slot past goaltender Jaxon Castor\u2019s outstretched glove hand. Bo Hanson set up Svechnikov\u2019s 19th goal of the season. Svechnikov leads all USHL rookies in scoring with 36 points. \n \nMuskegon had two Grade A chances to win the game late in regulation and in overtime. But Castor stopped Adams in both instances. \n \nThe Lumberjacks went 1-for-4 on the power play, while Dubuque failed to convert on its five opportunities. \n \nMuskegon finished with a 28-23 advantage in overall shots on goal. The Lumberjacks outshot Dubuque, 24-8, over the final two periods and overtime. \n \n\"It's kind of quirky the way this weekend turned out,\" Saints associate head coach JB Bittner said. \"We obviously had the rough start (Friday) night, but, for the most part, we felt we played really well after that. (Saturday) night we played really well in the beginning and kind of ran out of gas in the end. \n \n\"But the thing is this was two really good teams going at it this weekend. Both teams played really well at times. The times when we weren't playing well, it was mainly because Muskegon was doing a lot of things really well. They were two really good hockey games.\" \n \nGuttman saw his league-leading 12-game point streak come to an end. He managed two shots on goal. \n \nThe Saints continue a four-game road trip Thursday and Friday with games at Sioux Falls and Des Moines before they return home Saturday night against Cowbell Cup rival Cedar Rapids at Mystique Community Ice Center.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JIM LEITNER jim.leitner@thmedia.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"USHL: Saints beat Muskegon in shootout","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202480031","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/17/c178149f-e7e9-59a5-b82f-5ab7c6b30620/58844885e0d1d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C219"}],"video":[]}}

There is no cure once an animal becomes infected. \n \nThe DNR met with hunters and landowners in Harpers Ferry and Waukon on Jan. 18 to discuss collecting additional deer samples from areas where data is limited and to get more samples from the immediate areas where new positive cases were confirmed. At each meeting, attendees volunteered to help collect additional samples. \n \n\u201cWe hope to collect 250 to 300 samples from mature deer from a specific area around Harpers Ferry and that will do two things \u2014 provide information on specific areas in the target zone where we do not have any data and to remove animals from the area where CWD-positive deer have been found,\u201d said Dr. Dale Garner, chief of the Iowa DNR\u2019s Wildlife Bureau. \n \n\u201cThere is no good news when it comes to chronic wasting disease. We know that if we leave it alone, it\u2019s going to spread. By removing adult deer, we are trying to target animals that are most likely to carry the prion, which will slow the spread of the disease while still allowing for quality deer hunting experiences each fall.\u201d \n \nChronic wasting disease involves a misshapen protein called a prion. Since this is a protein, a deer\u2019s body does not recognize it as a foreign substance, so it does not produce an antibody response. \n \n\u201cThere is no way to kill the prion and the disease is always fatal,\u201d Garner said. \n \nThe DNR established a scientific collection effort from Jan. 21 to Feb. 5 in a defined area near Harpers Ferry. \n \nParticipants met with local DNR wildlife staff to discuss how to remove the deer, where they planned to focus their effort, and how to contact the DNR to provide the lymph nodes for testing. \n \nOnce a sample is submitted, it takes two-to-three weeks to get results back. \n \nParticipants must have a scientific collectors permit and tags and must contact the DNR within 24 hours of collecting deer to arrange for sample collection. There is no fee for the permits. Participants may use shotguns, muzzleloaders, bows and rifles .24 caliber and larger. All other regulations, including the blaze orange requirement and shooting hours restrictions, apply. \n \nPermits are available from noon to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekends until Feb. 5 at the Allamakee County Conservation office at 427 North First Street, in Harpers Ferry. A group leader may sign up other members by having their names and phone numbers. \n \nA similar effort took place in 2015. The collection had a goal of 200 samples, of which 105 deer were collected, providing 85 usable samples. Twenty fawns were not sampled. \n \nThe Iowa DNR began collecting deer tissue samples in 2002 after the CWD outbreak in Wisconsin. Since then, more than 61,000 samples from wild deer and 4,000 samples from hunting preserve deer have been collected and tested. The first wild deer tested positive in 2013, followed by three in 2014, two in 2015 and nine so far in 2016. \n \nChronic wasting disease is not just an Iowa issue; Minnesota has had a spike in deer testing positive for the disease as well. Illinois, Nebraska, Missouri and Wisconsin are all battling this disease. \n \nParticipation is voluntary and there are ways other than removing deer to help slow the spread of CWD in this area. \n \n\u201cWe encourage everyone to not use piles of feed or salt-mineral licks to attract deer. These baited sites increase the concentration of deer which facilitates transmission of the disease,\u201d said Garner. \u201cAnd don\u2019t leave a carcass or bones from this region to decay on the land. Place remains in heavy-duty plastic garbage bags to be properly disposed of in a landfill.\u201d \n WISCONSIN DEER PLAN ACCEPTS APPLICATIONS  \nConservation-minded people throughout Wisconsin are encouraged to enroll in the Deer Management Assistance Program to improve wildlife habitat on property they own or hunt. \n \nDMAP provides resources for wildlife habitat management, which complements land use activities like agriculture and timber management on properties of any size. \n \nThe application deadline is March 1 for properties larger than 160 acres, which may be eligible for a site visit and management plan in 2017. While applications may be submitted at any time, landowners are encouraged to apply now to receive immediate access to informational resources, including: \n \n\u2022 Habitat and deer management information \n \n\u2022 Communication with local DNR staff \n \n\u2022 Annual DMAP reports and publications \n \n\u2022 Volunteer opportunities \n \n\u2022 Invitations to DMAP workshops \n \n\u201cDNR staff currently work with more than 1,000 DMAP cooperators and two public land agencies on nearly 221,000 acres of land across the state to improve habitat for the wildlife resources we all enjoy,\u201d said Bob Nack, DMAP coordinator for the Department of Natural Resources. \u201cWe continue to develop new ways for cooperators to get involved and expand their knowledge of habitat and wildlife management.\u201d \n \nNeighboring landowners with properties within one-half mile of each other are encouraged to enroll as a group cooperative. Landowners in a group cooperative with a combined acreage of 160 acres or more receive a site visit and management plan. Group cooperatives also provide an opportunity to monitor local wildlife populations and share costs and equipment on habitat projects to benefit deer and other wildlife over a greater area. \n \nAnother benefit open to all DMAP cooperators is a series of annual DMAP workshops held regionally throughout Wisconsin. Six deer and habitat workshops were offered to DMAP cooperators in 2016, and additional workshops are slated for spring and summer 2017. Topics range from invasive species management and how to conduct a timber harvest to aging deer by tooth wear. \n \n\u201cDMAP workshops are a great opportunity to network with other conservation-minded people,\u201d Nack said. \u201cDMAP cooperators share a common goal of promoting the principles of land stewardship and sharing their experiences with others.\u201d \n \nFor more information regarding DMAP and to apply, go to dnr.wi.gov and search keyword \u201cDMAP.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"WENDY PAULY For the TH"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Tri-state outdoors notes: Positive tests found for chronic wasting disease in deer near Harpers Ferry","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://dnr.wi.gov/"],"sequenceId":"695202480720","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It showed the scores when the U.S. beat Russia in the hockey semifinals, then Sweden for the gold medal. \n \nDaktronics will get one of the scoreboard\u2019s four panels, while another will go to the Lake Placid Olympic Museum. Locations for the other two panels haven\u2019t been determined. \n NHL leaning toward Olympic shutout  \nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The NHL\u2019s top officials are still leaning against allowing the world\u2019s top hockey players to participate in the Pyeongchang Olympics next year. \n \nDeputy commissioner Bill Daly acknowledged Saturday that the NHL\u2019s Board of Governors doesn\u2019t want to shut down the league to allow its players to participate in South Korea. \n \nDaly says the owners\u2019 minds would have to be changed by something dramatic, but he doesn\u2019t know what that change would be. \n \nThe league and the International Ice Hockey Federation have no firm deadline to decide whether NHL players will participate in their sixth consecutive Olympics, but the final decision has already been left for later than in previous years. \n The players gathered in Los Angeles for All-Star weekend are unanimously hopeful they\u2019ll be allowed to play.  \nBASEBALL \n Twins to erect statue of Tom Kelly  \nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 The Minnesota Twins plan to honor former manager Tom Kelly with a bronze statue outside Target Field. The team made the announcement at TwinsFest on Friday night. The statue will be unveiled this season, although the date is not yet set. Kelly led the Twins to World Series titles in 1987 and 1991. His record of 1,140-1,244 places him first on the Twins\u2019 managerial list in wins and games. Kelly retired after the 2001 season. His No. 10 was retired in 2012, the first Twins manager to be so honored. \n \nAt Target Field, Kelly\u2019s statue will join the likenesses of Kirby Puckett, Rod Carew, Harmon Killebrew, Calvin Griffith, Carl and Eloise Pohlad, Tony Oliva and Kent Hrbek. \n Dodgers sign 1B Ike Davis  \nLOS ANGELES \u2014 First baseman Ike Davis and the Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to a minor league contract with an invitation to the team\u2019s spring training camp in Arizona. \n \nDavis played eight games last June for the New York Yankees. His last full year in the majors was 2014 when he split time with the Mets and Pirates, hitting .233 with 11 home runs and 51 RBIs in a combined 427 plate appearances. \n \nThe Dodgers said Friday that Davis will join 21 other non-roster invitees next month in Glendale, Arizona, including infielder Charlie Culberson, outfielder Tyler Holt, reliever Brandon Morrow and catcher Bobby Wilson. \n Rockies officially sign Greg Holland  \nDENVER \u2014 The Colorado Rockies made their deal with Greg Holland official on Saturday, signing the right-handed reliever coming off reconstructive elbow surgery to a one-year, $7 million contract. \n \nHolland was the closer for Kansas City through most of 2014 and 2015, when the Royals made back-to-back trips to the World Series. He injured his right elbow in late 2015 and missed all of last season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. Before his injury, the 31-year-old was considered as one of the most dominant closers in the game, posting a 1.21 ERA in 2013 and a 1.44 ERA in \u201814. \n Former Cy Young pitcher has throat cancer  \nSAN DIEGO \u2014 Randy Jones, the San Diego Padres\u2019 first Cy Young Award winner, is fighting throat cancer linked to tobacco use during his baseball career. \n \nJones told the San Diego Union-Tribune on Thursday that he has been undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatments since being diagnosed in November. \n \nThe 67-year-old former pitcher says the cancer was caught early and hasn\u2019t spread. Jones said doctors told him it\u2019s a result of the chewing tobacco he used as a player. He has smoked cigars throughout his adult life. \n \nHall of Famer Tony Gwynn, a longtime Padres star and franchise icon, died of salivary gland cancer in 2014 that he believed was related to using tobacco during his major league career. Jones was drafted by the Padres in 1972 and became the club\u2019s first pitcher to appear in an All-Star Game in 1975. He was an All-Star the following year when he won the NL Cy Young Award. \n \nATHLETICS \n Maine high school deploys deaf mascot  \nPORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Kamron King says his goal as the first deaf mascot at Portland High School is something he won\u2019t always notice: making the crowd louder. \n \nFifteen-year-old Kamron is a freshman from Saco who started donning a bulldog costume during the fall football season and is now working the sidelines at basketball games. \n \nKamron says being deaf doesn\u2019t interfere with performing, other than occasionally needing someone to direct him toward young children in need of a high-five. The costume\u2019s heavy mask obscures his vision. Kamron\u2019s parents say it\u2019s a natural fit for a kid who loves sports and costumes.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: MLB - Minnesota Twins news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - San Diego Padres news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NHL - Chicago Blackhawks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - Los Angeles Dodgers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sports in brief: Nine Blackhawks land on NHL 100 list","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202481108","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I think we see an emerging leader.\u201d \n \nPayton Banks added 17 points, Tony Carr picked up 13 and Mike Watkins chipped in 10 and pulled down nine rebounds to help Penn State (12-10, 4-5 Big Ten) snap a 3-game losing skid. \n \nThey couldn\u2019t have done it without those free throws from Garner as Illinois (13-9, 3-6) closed the gap after trailing by 20 at halftime. \n \nMalcolm Hill led Illinois (13-9, 3-6) with 19 points and Jalen Colman-Lands added 13. Coleman-Lands cut the lead to 65-62 with a 3-pointer with 1:58 left before Garner hit four free throws in the final 38 seconds to keep it out of reach. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t like our disposition at all in the first half,\u201d Illinois coach John Groce said. \u201cI thought it was unacceptable. Just didn\u2019t think we were really good. We could be here for 30 minutes picking on a variety of areas in the first half.\u201d \n BIG PICTURE  \nIllinois: The Fighting Illini dropped to 0-5 on the road. They\u2019ll return home for their next two but it won\u2019t get any easier \u2014 their next two opponents are a combined 33-10 \u2014 before heading back out of town to face third-place Northwestern (17-4, 6-2). \n \nPenn State: The Nittany Lions needed to reboot after being outscored by an average of 26 points in their last two losses on the road. \n BIG FIRST HALF  \nGarner, who entered the game shooting just 36 percent from 3-point range, admitted he had been frustrated with his shots not falling. \n \nHis solution? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely got in the gym more over the past week,\u201d Garner said. \u201cA little bit of extra work didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d \n \nPenn State led for all but 1:15 and took control early with pinpoint shooting sparked by Garner\u2019s first make \u2014 the first of nine 3-pointers for Penn State \u2014 on his first attempt. \n \nThe Nittany Lions made 60 percent of their first-half shots and Garner and Banks combined to make 8 of 13 from the field and 6 of 9 3s. \n \nDUNKS FOR THE WIN \n \nPenn State got it done inside, too, mostly with big dunks that brought a sizable Bryce Jordan Center crowd to its feet. \n \nNone of Penn State\u2019s six dunks were nicer than a big slam by Watkins with less than a minute in the first half. Garner noted the setup \u2014 a drive and behind-the-back feed from Terrence Samuel \u2014 might\u2019ve been prettier. \n \n\u201cThose guys are slashers, they like to get in the paint and finish,\u201d Garner said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re hitting shots, the defense has to try to contain (Banks and Garner) and the Red Sea opens. When we\u2019re open, they\u2019re tough to guard.\u201d \n \nUP NEXT \n \nIllinois hosts No. 15 Wisconsin on Tuesday. \n \nPenn State travels to Indiana on Wednesday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TRAVIS JOHNSON The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: college basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"College basketball: Banks, Garner lead Penn State over Illinois","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202481277","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/aa/caabfe90-68c7-575f-8faa-213598bd3292/588d4bf5259d4.image.jpg?resize=300%2C441"}],"video":[]}}

Fundraising for the $5.5 million project will begin immediately, and Yoko said the group will seek corporate sponsors, private donors and other potential grants and awards. \n \nFollowing a business model similar to the non-profit Dubuque Community Ice & Recreation Center, Inc., the complex will serve as the home base for the local Protect Our Nation\u2019s Youth organization, with the Northwoods League franchise serving as the marquis tenant in a 1,500- to 2,000-seat stadium. The high-profile of the Fighting Saints and the United States Hockey League played a pivotal role in the development of the Mystique Community Ice Center from a small facility to a 3,000-seat arena prior to the 2010-11 season. \n \n\u201cThe ice arena has made our community a better place to live because it\u2019s created so many more opportunities and things to do, and we believe this project will do the same thing from a baseball perspective,\u201d said Greg Yoko, one of the organizers of the Dubuque Area Youth Baseball and Softball Club. \u201cJust like the Fighting Saints have been a great asset to the community, the Northwoods League franchise will do the same.\u201d \n \nThe 20-team Northwoods League, which features top NCAA Division I underclassmen competing in a setting much like the professional minor leagues, has blossomed into the largest collegiate summer league in the United States. Last summer, the Madison Mallards led the league in attendance with an average of 6,039 fans to 34 home dates, while the league average hovered around 1,700. \n \nUnder the Dubuque proposal, the new Northwoods League franchise will lease the stadium from the non-profit group and manage the complex. \n \n\u201cAs a non-profit group, we have a hard time every year finding parents to volunteer their time to sell team sponsorships, sell outfield signs and raise money,\u201d Yoko said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we do for a living. We just want to play baseball. A Northwoods League franchise understands the business of selling sponsorships and revenue enhancements a lot better than we do. Hopefully, that includes securing a business or individual who sees the benefit in having their name attached to our project.\u201d \n \nThe PONY League, which annually averages 600 players of all abilities ranging in age from 4 to 18, currently leases three diamonds at the Derby Grange Golf & Recreation facility but has been scouting locations for a permanent home for more than two years. The league initially hoped to relocate to an 80-acre area along West 32nd Street but drew opposition from neighbors concerned about traffic, lighting and noise. \n \nThe PONY League plans to initially lease the land from current owners John and Sally Jo Herrig with the intent of purchasing it before the end of 2019. \n \n\u201cI applaud the group for having the tenacity they\u2019ve shown in getting this project off the drawing board,\u201d said Keith Rahe, the president and CEO of the Dubuque Convention & Visitors Bureau, who also understands the business of organized baseball as a long-time member of the Field of Dreams Ghost Players. \u201cFinding the necessary funding isn\u2019t easy, but the addition of a Northwoods League-type stadium is a huge part of any success. The Northwoods League has been very successful over the last decade or so, and their business model certainly works. \n \n\u201cThe Northwoods League is nothing like what Dubuquers remember from the Mud Puppies. Having worked with a lot of those franchises through the Ghost Players, it\u2019s amazing how well some of these franchises do.\u201d \n \nAnd the new team won\u2019t have to look far for business advice. \n \n\u201cThe Fighting Saints are a perfect example of, if you have the right organization that\u2019s well run, people will get behind it and support it, not only as fans but from a financial standpoint,\u201d Rahe said. \u201cIt\u2019s great entertainment and another thing to do to enhance the community.\u201d \n HISTORY IN DUBUQUE  \nThe Mud Puppies joined four other franchises \u2014 Rochester, Minn., and the Wisconsin communities of Kenosha, Manitowoc and Wausau \u2014 when the Northwoods League opened for business in 1994. But the minor league business model never took off at Petrakis Park, a facility more suited for recreational use in the McAleece Sports Complex, so the franchise relocated to St. Cloud, Minn., for the 1997 season. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve both changed a lot since then. Dubuque has changed, and obviously, we\u2019ve changed,\u201d said Dick Radatz Jr., the chairman of the Northwoods League. \u201cWe were kind of in our embryotic stage at that point, and we were still trying to figure ourselves out. Obviously, we\u2019ve grown substantially since then, and our business model has proven itself. \n \n\u201cNothing against Petrakis, because it has served a purpose to the community for many, many years. But we wouldn\u2019t consider a venue like that now. It was necessary at the time, but it\u2019s awfully difficult to create the kind of minor league environment you need to make this work from a business standpoint.\u201d \n \nThe Northwoods League will begin its 24th season in 2017 with 20 teams in two divisions. Despite humble beginnings, it has evolved into the largest collegiate summer league in the country and, because of its business model patterned after professional minor league baseball, the most widely attended. \n \nIts footprint ranges from Thunder Bay, Ontario, in the north to Waterloo, Iowa, in the south and from Bismarck, N.D., in the west to Battle Creek, Mich., in the east. In addition to Madison and Waterloo, Dubuque could develop natural geography rivalries with teams in LaCrosse, Wis., and Rockford, Ill. \n \n\u201cWe were pretty big dreamers when we started the league, but this has developed into way more than even we envisioned,\u201d Radatz said. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a journey, and we had a lot of ups and downs in those early years when Dubuque was involved. Lately, fortunately, we\u2019ve had a lot more ups than downs.\u201d \n \nDespite its previous struggles and lack of a suitable stadium, Dubuque has been on the league\u2019s radar for several years. And Radatz believes it could follow in the footsteps of Kenosha, which departed the league in 1998 but returned in 2014 and finished third in attendance with an average of 2,514 fans last season. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re both communities that couldn\u2019t survive for one reason or another back in the early days but we believe can thrive now,\u201d Radatz said. \u201cJust as our league has grown a lot since those early days, Dubuque has grown, too.\u201d \n \nLaCrosse Loggers general manager Chris Goodell, a former honorable mention all-state baseball player at Oelwein (Iowa) High School who played at the University of Dubuque under Dennis Rima in the late 1990s, said his organization would jump at the opportunity to operate an expansion franchise in Dubuque. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been poking around Dubuque for the last couple of years, and we love the market,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThere are a lot of similarities between LaCrosse and Dubuque in terms of the size of the market, the rich baseball history and the fact that the economic development group has a lot of positive, forward-thinking things going on. And we love the fact that, geographically, it fits perfectly within the footprint of our league, which will keep costs down. \n \n\u201cThe league is drastically different now than it was when the Mud Puppies were in Dubuque. There\u2019s so much more stability in it, and it really fits in well with the Midwest style of life. That explains why you have someone like me who has stayed in the league for the past 18 years.\u201d \n \nLaCrosse entered the Northwoods League in 2003 and immediately developed into one of the league\u2019s top draws. The Loggers built the Lumberyard at Copeland Park and have developed it over the years to suit growing needs. \n \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long to figure out that there are good organizations and those that just don\u2019t get it, and the Loggers are definitely one that get it,\u201d Rahe said. \u201cThey\u2019ve developed quite the atmosphere, and to have them as the main draw of a complex like the one in Dubuque brings a level of importance to the project.\u201d \n \nGoodell believes his organization could hit the ground running in Dubuque. \n \n\u201cWe have 15 years of experience, so we have the knowledge and the wherewithal to have success with our model,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe live and breathe baseball, and this is our main thing. There wouldn\u2019t be any kind of learning curve, like you\u2019d have with a new organization. We could come in and engage with the community right away.\u201d \n CALIBER OF PLAY  \nReed Stumpf loves the idea of the Northwoods League returning to Dubuque. \n \nThe University of Dubuque senior pitcher spent the last month of the 2016 season with the Wisconsin Rapids Rafters and helped the team win its first Northwoods League playoff championship in franchise history. \n \nStumpf, a former Dubuque Hempstead standout, appeared in six regular-season games and went 2-0 with a 2.45 ERA and six strikeouts in 11 innings of work for the Rafters. The reliever earned a victory in his only postseason appearance, striking out four and not allowing a run in four innings. \n \n\u201cIt was an experience I\u2019ll never forget, because the environment, the atmosphere and the level of play was exactly like what you could expect if you were playing professional baseball,\u201d said Stumpf, one of the rare NCAA Division III athletes to earn an opportunity to play in the Northwoods League. \u201cSo many of the guys who played in the league last year will be playing pro ball in the next couple of years, and the Northwoods League is great preparation for that. \n \n\u201cThe talent level was unbelievable. You had elite college players who were so smooth and so advanced, and the community really embraced it. It\u2019s something Dubuque doesn\u2019t get to see right now, so I\u2019d love for the city to get a franchise.\u201d \n \nThe Northwoods League has proven to be fertile proving ground for future Major League Baseball players. Jeff Weaver, who played for the Mud Puppies in 1995 and won a World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006, became the first Northwoods League graduate to reach the big leagues in 1999, and 162 players have followed suit. The Mud Puppies produced two other big leaguers, Shawn Sedlacek and Robb Quinlan. \n \nThe list of Northwoods League graduates includes Juan Pierre (Manitowoc), Curtis Granderson (Mankato), Andre Ethier (Rochester), World Series MVP Ben Zobrist (Wisconsin), National League Cy Young winner Max Scherzer (LaCrosse) and Chris Sale (LaCrosse). \n \n\u201cEvery team is loaded with high-end talent that you\u2019re going to be seeing in the big leagues in a few years,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re still amateur athletes and we don\u2019t have to pay salaries, we can keep the ticket prices very family friendly. It\u2019s a great opportunity to see the up-and-coming talent at an affordable price before they make it.\u201d \n \nThe Northwoods League environment advances the careers of more than just the players. Stumpf said several of his University of Dubuque classmates have served sports management internships with Northwoods League franchises. \n \nThe typical Northwoods League franchise employs up to 10 full-time staff members and several dozen seasonal workers. \n NEED FOR STADIUM  \nLast season, the Loggers played just 36 home games at the Lumberyard in LaCrosse. Local colleges, high schools and American Legion teams accounted for the other 184 games at the one-diamond facility. \n \nYoko expects the stadium diamond at the proposed complex to experience similar usage. \n \n\u201cThe facility won\u2019t be exclusive to the Northwoods League or the PONY League,\u201d Yoko said. \u201cObviously, the No. 1 reason for us doing this is to have a place to play, and we will have priority as far as scheduling goes. But we really want this to be a community amenity that enhances the quality of life in Dubuque. \n \n\u201cWe want it to be so much more than just a baseball facility.\u201d \n \nFor years, baseball visitors to Dubuque have complained about the lack of quality facilities. The county\u2019s top diamonds reside in the outlying communities of Cascade, Dyersville, Farley and Peosta. \n \n\u201cHaving a nice baseball facility is huge for Dubuque,\u201d Rahe said. \u201cWe definitely need that. I\u2019m a baseball guy, and from a fan\u2019s perspective, I really love this.\u201d \n \nYoko said plans for the complex include a walking/biking trail as well as park-like amenities, such as playground equipment, to make it a more well-rounded recreational outlet. It will also include ample concessions and restroom facilities. \n \nYoko hopes the complex can include a display honoring the Dubuque County Baseball Hall of Fame and the local history of the sport.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JIM LEITNER jim.leitner@thmedia.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Northwoods League returning to Dubuque in 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202482618","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/f8/df865ec8-85eb-5681-b6db-ed00639b2ee5/588d57c84f6ca.image.jpg?resize=300%2C166"}],"video":[]}}

According to its sources, Assad is being treated by a Russian-Syrian medical team on a weekly basis, adding that he has undergone medical tests when he was in Moscow in October. \n \nPro-Syrian regime Lebanese newspaper al-Diyar reported on Friday that Assad suffered from a stroke, but denied the news today. \n \nThere were also rumors that Assad is at the American University Hospital (AUH) in Beirut. However, Al Arabiya contacted the hospital and no information on the issue was given. Al Arabiya has also tried to contact Damascus Hospital, but there has been no response. \n \nOn the other hand, in a statement carried by the Presidency of the Syrian Arab Republic page on Facebook, Syrian authorities said that such rumors were incorrect. \n \nEarlier this week, Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat claimed the president\u2019s mental health has deteriorated after almost six years of civil war. \n \nCiting unnamed sources it said Russian officials believed Assad was \u201cexhausted by five years of war and tension\u201d and had developed a nervous tick in his left eye as a result of \u201cpsychological pressure\u201d. \u2013 Samaa/Agencies \n \n Tweet  \nStory first published: 29th January 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Rumors about Assad\u2019s assassination and critical health","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"PK","country":"Pakistan"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"SAMAA TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"361821793","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"232"},"name":"SAMAA TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.samaa.tv"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://english.alarabiya.net/en/media/print/2017/01/28/News-of-Bashar-al-Assad-suffering-a-stroke-has-gone-viral.html","https://twitter.com/share"],"sequenceId":"695202483829","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We get in the post to Ethan and he\u2019s a great player and made the right reads.\u201d \n \nHapp was the only player for the Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) to shoot above 50 percent (12 for 18) and the team finished at 33.3 percent for the game (20 for 60) including 3 for 23 from 3-point range. \n \nCorey Sanders had 15 points for the Scarlet Knights (12-10, 1-8), who lost for the ninth time in 10 games. \n \nThe Badgers came into the game tied for first in the Big Ten with No. 22 Maryland. They have won 14 of their last 15 games. \n \nWisconsin struggled with its shooting but the Badgers made six of their seven shots in the overtime. \n \n\u201cWe had to find other ways to win besides scoring,\u201d Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said. \u201cThe maturity of this group was evident. They didn\u2019t panic in the huddles. Credit our guys for the way they gutted it out defensively.\u201d \n \nThey took the lead for good on a reverse by Happ on which he was fouled. He missed the free throw but corralled it and laid it in for a 51-48 lead with 2:42 to play. \n \nBoth the field goal percentage and 3-point percentage were season lows for Wisconsin. \n \n\u201cI thought their defense had an extra gear tonight,\u201d Koenig said of Rutgers. He finished 2 for 13 from the field including 2 of 10 from 3-point range. \n \nRutgers finished with a 44-41 rebound advantage but the Scarlet Knights committed 19 turnovers that turned into 17 points for the Badgers. \n \n\u201cWith them it\u2019s pick your poison,\u201d Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said. \u201cThey have the 3-point shooters and they have Happ inside. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d the first-year coach said. \u201cWe have to figure out a way to win down the stretch and make that big bucket.\u201d \n BIG PICTURE  \nWisconsin: The Badgers were making their third appearance at the current Madison Square Garden. They split two games last season. ... Nigel Hayes is the only player in Division I to accumulate 1,600 points, 650 rebounds and 250 assists. He is third highest active scorer behind Bryce Alford of UCLA and Josh Hart of Villanova. Hayes had seven points, 11 rebounds and four assists on Saturday. \n \nRutgers: The Scarlet Knights were making their 100th appearance in the current Madison Square Garden and they have a 45-55 record. They won their earlier appearance this season, beating Fordham 68-53. ... Rutgers\u2019 last win over a ranked opponent was a 67-62 victory over then-No. 4 Wisconsin on Jan. 11, 2015. \n BROADWAY BOUND  \nThis was the second time the Big Ten hosted a basketball-hockey doubleheader at Madison Square Garden. Last year it was Penn State and Michigan in both games. This year, Wisconsin plays Ohio State in hockey. \n \nThe Big Ten will play its conference tournament at Madison Square Garden in 2018. \n POLL IMPLICATIONS  \nWisconsin is on a roll, and this week\u2019s wins over Penn State and Rutgers won\u2019t impress many voters but the Badgers should be flirting with the top 10. \n UP NEXT  \nWisconsin: The Badgers are at Illinois on Tuesday. \n \nRutgers: The Scarlet Knights host Iowa on Tuesday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JIM O\u2019CONNELL The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: college basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"College basketball: No. 15 Wisconsin beats Rutgers in OT","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202484017","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/42/e42197b4-2157-5960-a381-bac9fcf1154e/588d1914e2558.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

This time at the highest level. \n \nMcCarron, the Dubuque Wahlert grad who rose from walk-on to starting wide receiver with the Iowa Hawkeyes, and LeShun Daniels both said they would be attempting a career in the NFL. \n \nThe two Hawkeyes were at the Grand River Center on Saturday, signing autographs during the Dubuque Sports and Recreation Festival. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m going to train for pro day in March and then see what happens after that,\u201d said McCarron, who led the Hawkeyes this season with 42 receptions for 517 yards and four touchdowns. \u201cI\u2019m going to give the NFL a chance and if that doesn\u2019t work out then I\u2019ll move on to the real world just like everyone else. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I have to give it a shot.\u201d \n \nDaniels said he expects to be either a third-day selection or sign as an undrafted free agent. \n \nBoth players have fallback options if the NFL doesn\u2019t work out. \n \nMcCarron has a degree in accounting and already has a job offer in hand. Daniels said he would go back to school and pursue a Master\u2019s degree to pursue a career as a strength and conditioning coach. \n \n\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll get drafted or get picked up by a team to allow me to have a chance to go out there and compete,\u201d said Daniels, who ran for 1,099 yards and 10 touchdowns. \u201cBasically, I know that I\u2019m going to be a Day 3 guy or a free agent type of player. That\u2019s kind of what I knew, kind of what I expected and what I\u2019ve been hearing. We\u2019ll see how the process goes. \n \n\u201cAll I\u2019m ready for is just a shot to go out there and compete.\u201d \n \nSigning autographs in Dubuque was a unique experience for McCarron, who remembers Hawkeyes players who visited to sign at previous events. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to be back in Dubuque, the hometown, my roots, and see all these young kids going through the same things that I did when I was a little kid here in Dubuque growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cJust being a little motivation or encouragement for these guys is awesome. \u201c \n \nBoth McCarron and Daniels contributed to Iowa\u2019s rebound from a disappointing 7-6 campaign in 2014. \n \nIowa posted its first 12-0 regular season in program history in 2015, reaching its first-ever Big Ten Championship game and earning its first Rose Bowl appearance in close to three decades. \n \nThe Hawkeyes finished 8-5 this fall, losing to Florida in the Outback Bowl. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great step in the right direction where the program is trying to go,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cObviously you want to win championships going to a Big Ten school, especially at the University of Iowa.

They started out playing together in Compton, California, hardly a hotbed for tennis, with their father Richard and mother Oracene as coach and mentor. And they still practice and travel together around the world. \n \nThey met for the first time at a major at Melbourne Park in 1998 \u2014 Venus won that one. In 2003, when the younger of the Williams siblings completed her \u201cSerena Slam\u201d of four consecutive titles, Venus was on the other side of the net. She didn\u2019t reach another Australian final for 14 years. \n \nWhen Serena sat on the court, holding both arms up to celebrate on Saturday, Venus walked over to her sister\u2019s side of the net for a hug. \n \n\u201cThis was a tough one,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she\u2019s an amazing person \u2014 she\u2019s my inspiration. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be at 23 without her \u2014 there\u2019s no way I would be at one without her. Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be and inspiring me to work hard.\u201d \n \nAsked if it felt awkward to be on the receiving end of so many losses to her sister, the 36-year-old Venus didn\u2019t flinch. \n \n\u201cNo, because I guess I\u2019ve been here before,\u201d she said. \u201cI really enjoy seeing the name Williams on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\u201d \n \nVenus won the last of her seven majors in 2008 at Wimbledon. She didn\u2019t make the second week of a major for a few years as she came to terms with an energy-sapping illness after being diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome in 2011. And she only made it back to the semifinals last year at Wimbledon. \n \nAnother shot at a first Australian Open title was a sign of progress, she said. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly where I want to be standing during these Grand Slams, is on finals day, having an opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the highlight of all this, is to be in that moment.\u201d \n \nSerena Williams, meanwhile, enjoyed the fact she made history in Melbourne. Only Margaret Court, with 24, is in front of her in terms of overall Grand Slam singles titles, although the Australian great won 13 of her Grand Slams before the Open era began in 1968. \n \n\u201cMy first Grand Slam started here, and getting to 23 here, but playing Venus, it\u2019s stuff that legends are made of,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written a better story.\u201d \n \nThe match didn\u2019t live up to its classic billing, with nerves and tension causing uncharacteristic mistakes and unforced errors, with four consecutive service breaks before Venus finally held for a 3-2 lead in the first set. That included a game when Serena had game point but served back-to-back double-faults and three in all to give up the break. \n \nThere were six service breaks in total. Both players were relatively subdued, except when Serena smashed her racket in the third game. \n \nAfter the fourth game, however, Serena Williams didn\u2019t face another break point in the 1-hour, 22-minute match. \n \n\u201cSerena Williams, that\u2019s my little sister,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI have been right there with you.

Then there was a dispute over the way the players got off the plane once they landed in Miami. For some reason, receiver Terance Mathis decided the Super Bowl stage would be a good week to talk about his battle with alcohol and a feeling that he wasn\u2019t appreciated. And brash cornerback Ray Buchanan turned media day into a full-blown circus by wearing a dog collar \u2014 the Falcons were underdogs, you see \u2014 and saying Broncos star Shannon Sharpe looked like a horse. \n \nAll of that paled in comparison to what happened the night before the game, when safety Eugene Robinson \u2014 perhaps the most respected member of the team \u2014 was arrested for trying to pick up a prostitute. Robinson was bailed out of jail and played in the game, only to get beaten on a long touchdown pass. \n \nNot surprisingly, the Broncos cruised to a 34-19 victory and their second straight title in John Elway\u2019s final game. \n \n\u201cAny kind of distraction hurts,\u201d Reeves recalled in an interview from his Atlanta home. \u201cWhen one player causes a distraction the night before the game, it makes it more difficult. But we just got beat by a better team.\u201d \n \nDespite the loss, the team is still remembered fondly in Atlanta, a city that has produced only one championship team \u2014 the 1995 World Series-winning Braves \u2014 in any of the major sports. \n \nJamal Anderson, who rushed for more than 1,800 yards and takes credit for the arm-flapping dance that gave the team its nickname, said he can hardly go anywhere without someone remembering the \u201898 Falcons. \n \n\u201cNo matter what airport I\u2019m in, when people recognize me, they yell, \u2018Dirty Bird!\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \n \nEighteen years later, with the Falcons headed back to the Super Bowl for only the second time in franchise history, the team that paved the way left behind some useful lessons. \n \nFor one, never assume there will be a return trip if things don\u2019t work out. The Dirty Birds certainly thought they\u2019d get another shot, but they followed up their 14-2 season by going 5-11 the following year \u2014 the first of three straight losing campaigns. They didn\u2019t even get back to the playoffs until 2002, with a largely different cast. \n \nBy then, Anderson was out of the league, his career cut short at age 29 by two severe knee injuries. \n \n\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get a chance to be there, you\u2019ve got to lay it all on the line.\u201d \n \nPlus, the sting of losing the final game of the season never leaves you. To this day, the 44-year-old Anderson has never watched a replay of his lone Super Bowl. \n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever get over losing a Super Bowl,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get that title forever. I\u2019m very proud of winning the NFC Championship and the way we did it. At least we got to hang that banner. But I sure wanted to win the Super Bowl.\u201d \n \nThe NFC Championship Game remains the highlight of the season for Reeves, especially since it came just three weeks after he underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery. \n \nDespite their lofty record, the Falcons were huge underdogs going on the road to face the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost only one game while setting an NFL scoring record. In the raucous Metrodome, Atlanta trailed by 10 points early in the fourth quarter, and it looked as though the Vikings would clinch the victory when Gary Anderson lined up for a 38-yard field goal with just over 2 minute remaining. \n \nStunningly, Anderson missed for the first time all season. \n \nThe Falcons drove for the tying touchdown and won in overtime on Morten Andersen\u2019s 38-yard field goal. \n \nOn the stage in the middle of a stunned, emptying stadium, Reeves did the \u201cDirty Bird\u201d with his players. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s not any question, the win in Minnesota\u201d was the game Reeves remembers most. \u201cBecause of the circumstances and how good a football team they were and winning on the road, having everything really against you as far as the crowd and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, the fact I had bypass surgery made it little more special.\u201d \n \nUnfortunately for Reeves and the Falcons, they couldn\u2019t win the game that really counted. \n \nLittle did they know, their loss would have a profound effect on a current Falcons star. \n \nVic Beasley was just 6 years old, but he was already a huge fan of the team growing up about an hour\u2019s drive north of Atlanta. Now an All-Pro defensive end who led the league in sacks, he hasn\u2019t forgotten the pain he felt watching the Falcons\u2019 first Super Bowl. \n \n\u201cI cried that night,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cI still remained a fan through thick and thin.\u201d \n \nNow, he and his teammates have a chance to finish the job. \n \nThey\u2019ve got no bigger fans than the Dirty Birds. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for them,\u201d Jamal Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m really, really happy for the city. I\u2019m really happy for Falcons fans, the true and hardcore fans who are supportive and encouraging. You know, we have an interesting history in this city. I\u2019m just happy to see that we finally made it back.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"PAUL NEWBERRY The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Denver Broncos news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Minnesota Vikings news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Super Bowl LI: As Falcons return to big game, remember the Dirty Birds","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202484527","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/38/c388a4b7-f37c-58d3-819e-f1441f0b3fed/588d0d1f90116.image.jpg?resize=300%2C233"}],"video":[]}}

LOUIS \u2014 The offseason discussion surrounding Yadier Molina has long centered on whether the St. Louis catcher should rest more during the season. \n \nAfter Molina played in a career-high 147 games last year, that consideration is in the forefront more than ever for the 34-year-old winner of eight Gold Gloves. So is the awareness that his time as one of the dominant backstops in baseball might soon start winding down. \n \nThe discussion about Molina\u2019s playing time hasn\u2019t been limited to only fans, with Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak recently saying he feels Molina would be \u201cbetter off\u201d with more rest. This after a season in which the Puerto Rican star didn\u2019t win the Gold Glove for the first time since 2007. \n \nIt\u2019s not an opinion shared by St. Louis manager Mike Matheny. \n \n\u201cMy job description is to win games,\u201d Matheny said. \u201cAnd if I\u2019ve got a player I feel is going to help us win games, and that I feel is able to answer the bell, he\u2019s going to be in the lineup.\u201d \n \nMatheny knows more than most about the grueling demands of catching over the course of a 162-game season, having won four Gold Gloves of his own for his work behind the plate. \n \nHe\u2019s managed Molina since 2012, during which time the catcher \u2014 who has been a part of nine playoff appearances and two World Series titles since debuting in 2004 \u2014 has played in an average of 133 games per season. \n \nAnd while Matheny understands the long-term concerns about Molina\u2019s ability to continue playing at a high level, he\u2019s also aware that last season was the first time the Cardinals have missed the playoffs over that stretch \u2014 with much of the prior success coming in large part to Molina. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, frustrating for me because I remember the years when I was able to play a lot,\u201d Matheny said. \u201cThere were times I felt good, and it just made no sense. And for whatever reason, sometimes you can feel a lot of pressure of the outside influences saying that you shouldn\u2019t be playing.\u201d \n \nMozeliak\u2019s comments about resting Molina more weren\u2019t his first on the topic. However, his interest has likely taken on more of a big-picture feel as the five-year contract extension Molina signed in 2012 nears its end. \n \nThe catcher is under contract for $14 million in 2017, and there is a $15 million mutual option for 2018, with a $2 million buyout. \n \nMolina has said in the past he prefers to remain in St. Louis for the remainder of his career, and the idea of him in another team\u2019s uniform is upsetting for many fans. For Mozeliak, it\u2019s about balancing what Molina is now with what he hopes to be in the years to come. \n \n\u201cI do feel like, from a general manager\u2019s seat, that you would want to balance that and try to protect him better than we have,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cBut, the guy loves to play. He trains extremely hard to prepare himself in the offseason for that 162 (games), and he\u2019s not an easy guy to talk to get out of that lineup.\u201d \n \nDespite turning 34 during the middle of last season, Molina was at his best offensively over the last few months of the season. He hit .365 after the All-Star break, and his .307 batting average for the season was the third best in his career. \n \nMatheny said Molina is better than most about telling him when he needs a day off to rest, and the manager said he plans to continue watching the catcher for signs of wear and tear. All the while, though, he\u2019s well aware there\u2019s only one Yadier Molina behind the plate. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a shelf life to this gig and eventually there\u2019s going to be a finger to point of why this, that or the other, but right now this guy works really hard to continue to answer the bell,\u201d Matheny said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s doing it well.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"KURT VOIGT The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Cardinals debating resting Molina more behind the plate","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202484704","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The one win was an upset at then-No. 19 Florida a week ago only to blow a 15-point lead in a loss to Arkansas on Tuesday night. \n \nIt didn\u2019t look good in the first half as Iowa State (13-7) jumped out to an 11-point lead. \n \nThe Commodores tied it at 33 going into halftime, and then they controlled the second half leading by as much as 15 in pulling out a much-needed win. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely big, again especially against an NCAA Tournament team in Iowa State, and to have the same situation in the same week it\u2019s kind of ironic,\u201d Vanderbilt coach Bryce Drew said. \u201cBut it definitely will hopefully give them confidence moving forward that we can execute the right way and close out games.\u201d \n \nLuke Kornet led Vanderbilt with 21 points and Nolan Cressler added 20. Jeff Roberson had 16, and Matthew Fisher-Davis added 14 before fouling out. \n \nMonte Morris led Iowa State with 25 points before fouling out. Donovan Jackson added 16 points off the bench, Matt Thomas had 14 and Deonte Burton 13. Nazareth Mitrou-Long, who came in averaging 15.9 points per game, had only four. \n \nIowa State coach Steve Prohm didn\u2019t like how his Cyclones walked the ball up the floor at times, not when their pace is best when running up and down the court. He also didn\u2019t like their defensive intensity and focus with Vanderbilt hitting 59.3 percent (16 of 27) in the second half. \n \n\u201cYou can\u2019t win on the road giving up 60 percent from the field,\u201d Prohm said. \n \nThe timing for this game didn\u2019t seem good for Vanderbilt, having lost its first three games in the SEC/Big 12 Challenge. \n \nBut Fisher-Davis opened the second half with a dunk to start a 9-2 spurt by Vanderbilt to take the lead for good. Morris scored to pull Iowa State within 44-40 when the Commodores responded with an 11-2 run capped by back-to-back 3s from Fisher-Davis, the second with 12:41 left. \n \nJackson hit two free throws for Iowa State, then Jeff Roberson made another 3 to give Vandy its biggest lead at 58-44 with 11:05 to go. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s good to represent our conference in this way,\u201d Kornet said. \u201cIowa State\u2019s a very good team. It\u2019s kind of a cool little break between conference play, and we\u2019re definitely glad to get this win.\u201d \n BIG PICTURE  \nIowa State: The Cyclones now are 2-2 in the SEC-Big 12 Challenge. They just couldn\u2019t slow down Vanderbilt, which went 21 of 26 at the free throw line (80.8 percent) and was 13 of 30 outside the arc (48.1 percent). \n \nVanderbilt: The Commodores desperately needed this performance against a team that came in with a 40 RPI. They jumped out to a big lead for a second straight game in the second half only to have Fisher-Davis go to the bench with four fouls with 6:47 left. Unlike against Arkansas, they kept going inside to protect their lead. \n MORRIS TOPS HORNACEK  \nMorris came in needing two assists to match the school record held by Jeff Hornacek. Morris got the second, giving him 665, with 16:14 left with an assist on Donovan Jackson\u2019s 3-pointer. He finished with three. \n UP NEXT  \nIowa State: Hosts No. 18 West Virginia on Tuesday night. \n \nVanderbilt: Visits Texas A&M on Tuesday night.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TERESA M.

The play truly encapsulates everything about the Bobcats\u2019 program this season. \n \n\u201cIt really does represent this team,\u201d WD coach Amy Ostwinkle said. \u201cWe tell them that every loose ball is ours and that it\u2019s all about heart and how bad you want it. You have to want it more than the other team and that was a perfect example of it. Lindsey sacrificing her body and making a great pass in the transition for a layup. That was just a heads-up play.\u201d \n \nWhile Western Dubuque may have firepower on offense, it begins with its scrappiness and defense. That was on full display against Wahlert, as the Iowa Class 4A No. 7-ranked Bobcats forced 15 turnovers and held the Golden Eagles to 21 percent shooting from the field in a 66-28 victory at Wahlert High School. \n \n\u201cEach and every day we come to practice and we work hard on defense,\u201d said WD senior guard Morgan Pitz, who scored a game-high 21 points behind four 3-pointers. \u201cWe really get down, rotate and help each other. That\u2019s what gets it done.\u201d \n \nWestern Dubuque (15-1) won its eighth straight game by executing on the defensive end. The Bobcats are allowing just 33.5 points per game this season and are winning games by an average of 24 points. Their total points allowed on the season (530) ranks in the top 10 in the state for all classes. \n \n\u201cWe have really talked to them about getting up in the passing lanes and doing the little things,\u201d Ostwinkle said. \u201cHaving weak side rotation and they\u2019re believing in it. Any team would rather play offense but it has to start with defense. They understand that and that\u2019s what\u2019s making the difference right now.\u201d \n \nThe game got away from Wahlert (4-13) early. Pitz scored in transition, then Peyton Koerperich canned a baseline 3-pointer. Ireland Hill made a basket inside and Pitz grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to give the Bobcats a 16-5 lead at the 2:06 mark of the first quarter. \n \nThe Bobcats put the game out of reach to open the second with a 12-0 run.

That order came from the President\u2019s inner circle, led by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon. Their decision held that, on a case by case basis, DHS could allow green card holders to enter the US. \n \nThere had been some debate whether green card holders should be even allowed to board international flights. It was decided by the Department of Homeland Security they could fly to the US and would be considered on a case-by-case basis after passing a secondary screening. \n \nBut the guidance sent to airlines on Friday night, obtained by CNN, said clearly, \u201clawful permanent residents are not included and may continue to travel to the USA.\u201d \n \nAs of Saturday afternoon, Customs and Border Protection continued to issue the same guidance to airlines as it did Friday, telling airlines that fly to the US that green card holders can board planes to the US but they may get extra scrutiny on arrival, according to an airline official. \n \nBefore the President issued the order, the White House did not seek the legal guidance of the Office of Legal Counsel, the Justice Department office that interprets the law for the executive branch. \n \nA source said the executive order did not follow the standard agency review process that\u2019s typically overseen by the National Security Council, though the source couldn\u2019t specifically say if that included the decision to not have the order go through the Office of Legal Counsel. \n \nSeparately, a person familiar with the matter said career officials in charge of enforcing the executive order were not fully briefed on the specifics until Friday. \n \nThe officials were caught off guard by some of the specifics and raised questions about how to handle the new banned passengers on US-bound planes. \n \nRegarding the green card holders and some of the confusion about whether they were impacted, the person familiar with the matter said if career officials had known more about the executive order earlier, some of the confusion could have been avoided and a better plan could be in place. \n \nAdministration officials also defended the process Saturday. They said the people who needed to be briefed ahead of time on the plane were briefed and that people at the State Department and DHS who were involved in the process were able to make decisions about who to talk and inform about this.

Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina\u2019s Zay Jones with 1:51 left but the North went for two points and a potential lead. \n \nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga\u2019s Keionta Davis, Peterman\u2019s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU\u2019s Harvey Langi. The South ran out the clock from there. \n \nWebb was the game\u2019s overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech. \n \nHe led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on a touchdown drive late, moving downfield on connections of 21 and 13 yards before the touchdown. \n \nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South\u2019s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 6-3. \n \nFor the North squad, Iowa quarterback C.J. Beathard completed 1 of 2 passes for 4 yards while carrying once for 12 yards. Wisconsin running back Corey Clement rushed three times for 26 yards. \n AWARD WINNERS  \nToledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors. The South\u2019s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. \n HEAVY TURNOVER  \nThe South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. That included a pair of interceptions thrown by Antonio Pipkin of Division II Tiffin and another by Tennessee\u2019s Dobbs. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North. \n COACHING STAFFS  \nHue Jackson and his Cleveland Browns staff led the South team, and have the first, 12th and 33rd overall picks in the April draft. The Chicago Bears\u2019 John Fox, who has the No. 3 pick, coached the North. They\u2019re mostly looking for players beyond their top pick in Mobile, since stars like Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson and Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen turned down invitations and Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett is a junior and not eligible.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JOHN ZENOR The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: college football news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"College football: Webb, South hold on for 16-15 win over North in Senior Bowl","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202490899","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/8d/b8da1356-333c-5be7-9d68-5911c6b5c8f5/588d4b3dc2147.image.jpg?resize=300%2C236"}],"video":[]}}

This year, the Winter Iowa Games celebrated its 25th year, and Dubuque, as a host city, has been instrumental in making the event an annual opportunity for Iowans to stay active. \n \nChuck Long, executive director of the Iowa Sports Foundation, said the Iowa Winter Games started with a group of 500 athletes. This year, more than 4,000 are participating, with Dubuque hosting 12 competitions at 14 different venues. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve just seen the chart of how it\u2019s grown,\u201d said Long, who is in his third year running the Games. \u201cIt\u2019s grown in a great way. We love having it in Dubuque. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that people in Iowa want to be active, and we\u2019re trying to push sports, recreation, health and wellness statewide. We have a great Eastern Iowa presence and it\u2019s really because of the games.\u201d \n \nOn Saturday, the Dubuque region hosted alpine ski racing, girls basketball, fitness walking, ice hockey, indoor soccer, martial arts, swimming, table tennis and volleyball. Today\u2019s schedule contains boys basketball, pickleball, road racing and Zumba, and on February 11-12, four more Winter Games events will take place in Cedar Rapids. Another 11 competitions have or will take place at varying locations throughout the state. \n \nThe Games attract athletes of all ages and experience, said Long. The youngest competitor is 4-year-old Urbandale figure skater Faline Senne; the oldest is Garner-native Marvin Engstler, an 84-year-old horseshoe thrower. Dubuquer Sarah Smith is the second-oldest female athlete at 77, competing today in the pickleball tournament. \n \n\u201cWe want a wide variety,\u201d Long said, adding that people from all 99 Iowa counties are participating this year. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an athlete to participate. Anybody can be an athlete at these games.\u201d \n \nWhile the event drives competition, organizers try to instill values of sportsmanship and camaraderie in the athletes. Dubuque-native Jim Rolling served as the commissioner of Saturday\u2019s youth volleyball tournament, and after five years helping run it, he said the reason he loves working the Iowa Games is helping young athletes learn. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re here to have fun, they\u2019re here to learn, it\u2019s not all about winning,\u201d Rolling said. \u201cTypically it\u2019s a good way to learn.

Kennedy International Airport on January 28, 2017 in New York City \n        A Brooklyn judge issued an emergency stay, temporarily freezing the expulsion of travelers under the newly-signed executive order by President Donald Trump that covers 7 Arab nations, after a habeas corpus petition was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. \nJudge Ann Donnelly of the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York issued the ruling after the American Union of Civil Liberties (ACLU) filed a legal challenge on behalf of two Iraqi immigrants, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi. \n \nBoth were denied entry to the US after landing at the airports despite having valid visas. US President Donald Trump, US Department of Homeland Security and US Customs and Border Protection are listed among the respondents. \nThe emergency stay does not only apply to Darweesh and Alshawi, but will also temporarily forbid US authorities from deporting immigrants with valid travel documents who are stranded at airports across the US due to the Trump's order. \n\n\"Class is pretty well defined as outline in the papers - otherwise would be reviewing stays for a hundred people,\" the presiding judge said, elaborating on the ruling, as reported by Jackie Vimo from National Immigration Law Center, on Twitter. \n \n\"The whole point of this hearing is to preserve the status quo. If this had been two days ago we wouldn't be here,\" she added. \nThe judge also requested a list of all people currently detained in the US as result of the implementation of the executive order. \n\nA statement released by the DHS late on Saturday said the department will \"comply with judicial orders\" of the federal judge. This does not cancel the president's executive order, however, the statement added, which means citizens from the list of seven Muslim countries included in the ban still cannot enter the United States. \n\n\"These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,\" the statement said. \n\nDarweesh, who was released later on Saturday, had been granted a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) for his year-long service to the US as an electrical engineer and contractor, ACLU said. According to a former Washington official, Brandon Friedman, the Iraqi \"was one of the first to sign up [as an interpreter] in 2003.\" \n\n\"Guy literally spent years keeping U.S. soldiers alive in combat in Iraq,\" he tweeted. \n\nACLU Executive Director, Anthony D. Romero, hailed the decision as the \"first loss in court\" for Donald Trump. \n\n\"Our courts today worked as they should, as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders,\" he said in statement. \n\nMeanwhile, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it has not yet seen a copy of the emergency stay, Reuters reported. The DHS continued to monitor litigation over the executive order, it added. \n\nSome 375 travelers have been affected by the order, according to a DHS source cited by Reuters, including 109 people who were denied entry into the US while in transit. Over 170 people were reportedly barred from boarding US-bound aircraft, the source said. \n \nEarlier on Saturday, President Trump insisted that his Friday order was \"not a Muslim ban,\" as the media had dubbed it, as he spoke to reporters in the White House's Oval Office. He said that measures were long overdue, Reuters reported. \n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump said. \n\nOn Friday, Trump signed the executive order, temporarily barring the citizens from seven countries with predominantly Muslim populations - Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Syria - from entering the US. \n\nThe controversial order led to hundreds of immigrants being stranded at airports across the US amid mounting public outrage. \n\nAt least 12 refugees were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport as a result of the ban, which sparked mass protests there with demonstrators demanding the immediate release of the migrants. \n \nThe executive order called for a pause for all refugee admissions for 120 days and barred travelers from the seven listed countries for at least 90 days. \n\"I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,\" Trump said on Friday, citing US national security concerns. Diplomatic passport holders are exempt from the order.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Federal judge blocks deportation of detainees over Trump refugee order","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sott.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"424104123","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"398"},"name":"Sott.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Science"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sott.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sott.net%2Fimage%2Fs18%2F373797%2Ffull%2FProtestors_rally_during_a_demo.jpg&hl=en-US","http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sott.net%2Farticle%2F341007-Federal-judge-blocks-deportation-of-detainees-over-Trump-refugee-order&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sott.net%2Fimage%2Fs18%2F373797%2Ffull%2FProtestors_rally_during_a_demo.","https://twitter.com/JackieVimo/status/825520915819720705","https://twitter.com/BFriedmanDC/status/824681213600403457","https://www.aclu.org/news/federal-court-grants-stay-challenge-trump-immigration-ban"],"sequenceId":"695202492655","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There\u2019s not enough drama. It\u2019s not real NFL football. \n \nBut Incognito, a Buffalo Bills guard, is like the vast majority of the 88 players invited to this all-star gathering Sunday night. He sees the Pro Bowl more as a celebration of achievement and as a way to thank the fans. \n \nHe wouldn\u2019t change a thing. \n \n\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s as good as it should be,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t ask guys to come out here and fly around at full speed when we\u2019ve been off for the last two or three weeks. And some guys are just coming down here after conference championship games. Maybe make it more fan interactive, get the fans involved more, do more of the skills competition.\u201d \n \nThe NFL has seemed open to ways to energize its end-of-the-year showcase that is now sandwiched between conference championship and Super Bowl weeks. A few years ago the league broke from the traditional AFC-NFC Pro Bowl matchup and allowed celebrity coaches to draft two teams. \n \nNow, in hopes of giving the game a lift, the NFL has moved the Pro Bowl from Hawaii to Orlando, where it has become more of a weeklong event, complete with a re-imagined Skill Showdown. The AFC-NFC matchup has also returned after three years of nonconference games. \n \nStill, it remains to be seen if the NFL can continue selling a game that bears little resemblance to the product it puts on the field during the season. The players come to the Pro Bowl to have fun, not get hurt and maybe win. \n \n\u201cThis Pro Bowl for me in a sense is special because you are coming here to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d \n \nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman said the intensity would rise and more invited players would show up if the NFL gave them their weekly game salaries. Under the collective bargaining agreement, each player from the winning team will make $61,000 this week and the losing players will take home $30,000. \n \n\u201cYou pay them what you are paying them and you get this performance,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different element. ... I guarantee you less guys would miss the Pro Bowl if you told you are going to pay them their normal salary for one more game.\u201d \n \nFormer NFL player and coach Herm Edwards says the game as played now is fine. He says the Pro Bowl is not about the game, it\u2019s about the fans and the players giving back. Thousands of fans have been out at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex this week watching both the AFC and NFC practice. \n \nAfter the practices were over most of the players signed autographs and took pictures in the laid-back atmosphere. All of the practices are short and glorified walk-throughs, and the players are mostly having fun with each other and the fans. \n \n\u201cWe are all ambassadors to this great game of football and how you conduct yourself once you leave this practice field is more important than how you play the game,\u201d said Edwards, who now works as analyst. \u201cThe fans aren\u2019t going to remember the game. The fans remember if Odell Beckham, Patrick Peterson, or if Drew Brees takes a picture with them, signs an autograph.\u201d \n \nEdwards, however, understands the criticism. He even admits, as a football purist, he doesn\u2019t watch the Pro Bowl. \n \nBut he says if the game does become more fiercely contested it would come at a cost that players, teams and even fans may not want to pay. \n \n\u201cThe only way to make it better is you do this: If you want all of them to show up, make the game worth $500,000,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey will all show up and now they play. Here is the problem, when one of them gets hurt you have the same problem.\u201d \n \nOakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledges being torn when his players are selected for the Pro Bowl. On one hand, he is excited for their recognition. On the other, he\u2019s concerned about injuries. \n \nMcKenzie would be in favor of more of skills challenge than a game where key players can be injured. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d said McKenzie, who will have four players representing the AFC on Sunday. \u201cI cringe every time I go to practice, but it\u2019s the nature of the game. It\u2019s what it is. But you do everything you can to set your safety-type precautions. What else can you do? Not play? I don\u2019t think that\u2019 right.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TERRANCE HARRIS The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NFL: Pro Bowl tries to strike balance between fun and competition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202502561","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/1a/31a82b96-35f8-5233-a322-90612f698bae/588d2182be28b.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

It also could prove to be detrimental to other businesses in the surrounding area, many of them small shops and restaurants owned and operated by entrepreneurs and small business people who are struggling to make a living as it is. \n \nThe soup kitchen concept arrives at the worst possible time as it comes mere weeks after the recent launch of the Pine Avenue Redevelopment Project, a collective effort to improve the appeal of the commercial strip that is being led by several prominent small business owners in the area. \n \nTheir goal is to enhance Pine Avenue through various public improvement projects and neighborhood cleanup efforts. Members are also looking to support struggling business owners and prod those who own property to do more with what they have. \n \nIt\u2019s essentially a leadership group for a vitally important business district that hasn\u2019t had such a thing since the state of New York forced the dismantling of the old Pine Avenue Business Association many years ago. \n \nTheir effort is to be lauded. \n \nPARB members have made it clear a soup kitchen is not the sort of thing they are looking to promote as part of their efforts. \n \nNor should they. \n \nAgain, just to be clear, this is not a slight against the poor or the needy or individuals or organizations looking to provide them with food and assistance. \n \nUnfortunately, Niagara Falls has shown for years now that it has a significant population of people who are unable to make it on their own and require to support to live healthier lives. \n \nFather Mazur\u2019s heart is in the right place. \n \nHis project is not. \n \nCity officials, including Mayor Paul Dyster and members of the city council, as well as representatives from the Niagara County Legislature, have already joined PARB members in questioning the wisdom of this plan. \n \nIt would be in the best interest of all parties involved to identify an alternative location where the soup kitchen can run as needed and the Pine Avenue Business District can grow as intended. \n \nOpening a soup kitchen in a piece of prime real estate in the heart of the Pine Avenue Business District would be a prime example of \u201cwrong place, wrong time.\u201d \n \nWhile this may not be an ideal situation, it does not have to be another classic Niagara Falls battle where a lot of egos get bruised and nothing productive comes from it. \n \nWe call on city and county officials, members of PARB, Father Mazur and the Catholic Diocese to work together to identify a viable alternative.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"EDITORIAL: Alternative location is right call for Pine Avenue food center","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Niagara","zipCode":"14302","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Niagara Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Niagara Gazette","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169790986","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Niagara Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.niagara-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202503791","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I don't know whether they go for two or three spinners in a Test.\n\n\"I've just got a feeling we'll see something different, something maybe special. We'll see a very different side to what we're normally used to \u2013 we're going to see more spin bowling over there.\n\n\"That's a good thing because you've got to play the conditions in India. The stats say that our quicks are better over there but mostly it's the quicks that bowl over there, we don't really bowl a lot of spin.\n\n\"It was Shane Warne before that and over the last 10 or so years there's been a lot of changes with our spin bowling.\"\n\nAustralia lost their last Test tour of India 4-0, and not a single member of the Australian team has won a Test in the country.\n\nNot since 2004 when Warne was rubbing shoulders with Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Glenn McGrath has Australia won a series in India. \n\nJohnson played seven Tests there without success before retiring from the longer form of the game at the start of last summer.\n\nAfter some significant arm-twisting by Scorchers coach Justin Langer, the fearsome left-arm quick was enticed to have a season in the BBL and his signing proved a masterstroke.\n\nHe saved his best two performances for last, claiming a record 3-3 in the semi-final win over the Melbourne Stars before finishing with 1-13 in his side's towering nine-wicket win over the hapless Sixers.\n\n\"It's just a really good tournament, I was probably one that never embraced Twenty20 cricket when I was playing international cricket but now that's all I'm playing, that's very enjoyable,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"The crowds are amazing too. That was one thing that I probably noticed throughout this Big Bash is the crowd and support and talking to the guys \u2013 random punters coming up and saying 'I hope you have a good season' to guys that don't have the profile.\n\n\"To get that experience and that exposure through the Big Bash, it's great for them.\"\n\nAnd icing the cake on the Scorchers' third Big Bash title, Johnson said he planned on returning to the competition next year.\n\n\"I only want to do it if I'm going to perform and I guess this year was a bit of a see how it sort of goes,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"JL [Langer] was really good with me throughout, he just said: 'Come and have fun mate, there's no pressure, you're not the No.1 strike-bowler we just want you to go and have fun and enjoy it and whatever happens happens'.\n\n\"It turns out that competitiveness in me is still there so if the body holds up and I'm bowling well then yeah. It seems like fresh is best.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"James Buckley"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Johnson expects Australia to go slow in India","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Melbourne Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169652301","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3545"},"name":"Melbourne Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theage.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202505803","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Never mind the huge murder rate in Chicago under Obama, which that president didn\u2019t create either (nor say much about). \n \nYou want to find bullies, Meryl? Get your ilk out of Malibu and go for a walk at 11 p.m. in downtown Detroit, and even big swaths of the nation\u2019s capital. You\u2019ll find plenty of vicious thugs who\u2019d be operating even had Trump never embraced politics. \n \nBut yes, well-clad Hollywood types in attendance ate this up, including all the self-congratulation emanating from Streep on the importance of their products; and this despite horrid persecution which poor Tinseltown (along with the mainstream press) supposedly has to endure from bad old Trumpnicks. \n \nMeanwhile, many such \u201cdeplorables\u201d now take refuge in movies on TCM, old Perry Masons, etc. Back when, Hollywood didn\u2019t complain so much, or repetitively blow its trumpet, and instead concentrated on putting out good work that has lasted, as much of what currently appears probably won\u2019t. \n \nThese people in their Golden Globes La-La Land reminded me of the old New Yorker cartoon, where the entire U. S. is almost all Manhattan. For Streep\u2019s acolytes, the millions in heartland states who so helped propel Trump into office are just misguided yahoos stuck in fly-over country. For Hollywood true problems apparently mean little, starting with a gargantuan, unpayable debt, which grew under President Obama from circa 10 to 20 trillion dollars. To them that\u2019s a small detail to be ignored in favor of more important needs in our society, such as for more inclusive bathrooms and media that can be biased but not criticized. \n \nSure, Streep has been a fine actress, no question. She astonished back in the day opposite Dustin Hoffman in \u201cKramer vs. Kramer\u201d (1979) and kept evolving in a long, distinguished career that isn\u2019t yet done. \n \nBut when she lauds today\u2019s aggrieved Hollywood as uniformly wonderful in all it does and feels, she\u2019s off base. For some reason my mind flips to a contrastive era personified in two great actors featured in Hitchcock\u2019s film classic, \u201cVertigo.\u201d \n \nI recently gave sustained attention to that flick which had baffled this boy when I first saw it back in 1958. And in fact, it didn\u2019t do well at the box office. \n \nNow it\u2019s rightly hailed as one of the great American films of all time. And in good part due to its stars, James Stewart, a WW II hero who would never have approved all of today\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d twists and turns so beloved by contemporary Hollywood. Just for openers, the war on law enforcement, which rarely seemed to bother the previous president\u2019s supporters in Tinseltown, would have totally repelled Mr. Stewart. \n \nThat actor persuaded in \u201cVertigo\u201d because of his American normality, his heartland qualities, if you will. And according to his female co-star, Kim Novak, he made her work better, too, due to his concentrated emotionality, which he enhanced in her. \n \nNovak had had to tilt with Columbia\u2019s czar Harry Cohn, who wanted to change her too ethnic last name and much else. Proud of her full Czech origins (growing up in Chicago), she fought for the Novak part and won. \n \nThen when Hitchcock tapped her for \u201cVertigo\u201d (only because his preferred female lead, Vera Miles, got pregnant), he made sure to cold-shoulder her throughout the shooting, and to deride the final product, in good part due to Novak\u2019s contribution. And wrongly! \n \nIn the past decade or two, she\u2019s been showered with accolades for her standards in films like \u201cVertigo,\u201d including via sustained applause at the Cannes Film Festival. \n \nProgressive? Probably more than Stewart, but Novak would never be so brutal as well as mewling (a lethal combination) as today\u2019s Hollywood re Republicans, as if only one party should ever win elections and set policies. \n \nStewart and Novak did it their way, but with class; not so Meryl and the many who endorse her brand of pampered, superior, chip-on-the-shoulder thinking in current Hollywood. More\u2019s the pity ... \n \nB.B.

Это могут быть дети от 0 до 5 годиков. То есть диапазон все же большой. Мне, например 21, и я не стесняюсь тестировать игры этого жанра, чтобы они были вполне нормальными и адекватными и мне не предъявляли требования с целью удалить игру (надеюсь, этого не будет). Ну а теперь давайте пройдемся по основным позициям игр и посмотрим, что они (игры) представляют с себя. Но сначала порекомендую вам обратится , где можно найти множество классных детских игр!\\r \n\\r \nИтак, поехали: Игра под названием \u201cСоздатель книги\u201d, которая вышла в наш мир в 2006-м году получила широкое распространение из-за раскрученности того бренда, который там есть. И этот бренд имеет имя \u201cWalt Disney\u201d. Все сделано от души, красиво и грамотно. Любой и каждый ребенок может почувствовать атмосферу любви и заботы со стороны авторов идеи проекта. В любом случае, есть инструкции на этот счет, если что-то пойдет не так, как хотелось бы. Цель игры \u2013 создать книгу с несколькими ее страничками. Вы можете себе представить, если применить все это дело на практике. Будут создаваться десятки, а то и тысячи качественных книг (конечно, все зависит от того, как ребенок ведет свой дневник). То есть таланты появляются прямо из экранов мониторов, и это хорошо. Надеюсь, что будут применять полученные навыки. Но давайте сделаем резюме следующей игрушки.\\r \n\\r \nИгра \u201cСоедини пару\u201d кажется безобидной до поры до времени, но когда перед тобой несколько десятков героев \u2013 становится не до шуток. Сложность присутствует, ну а как же без нее родимой. Дети должны и просто обязаны подвергаться определенным сложностям, даже на начале своего жизненного пути. Конечно, смотря какие трудности, но они должны быть. В этой игре по диснеевской задумке, ребенок видит мультипликационного героя и пытается подобрать этому персонажу пару. Я думаю, девочки с этим заданием справятся на все 100. Но только, если смотрели мультики с этими мультяшками. Если вы не знаете, кто такой Алладин, тогда придется действовать наугад. С вами была команда сайта, где расположены прикольные и оригинальные детские игры для девочек.

You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\u201d Trump told reporters even as the sweeping immigration order caused chaos and confusion at airports across the country, triggering widespread protests. \n \nHe, however, denied that barring refugees from several predominantly Muslim nations amounted to a ban on Muslims. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared,\u201d Trump told reporters after he signed three more executive orders related to lobbying ban, plan to defeat ISIS and reorganisation of National Security Council. \n \nPresident Trump yesterday ordered \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of people entering the US from seven Muslim-majority countries and banned the entry of Syrian refugees until further notice, as part of new measures to \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists\u201d out of America. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. \n \nThe controversial move, signed a week after he was sworn- in as the President, fulfills the vow Trump made on the campaign trail to limit Muslim immigration to the US. \n \nThe immigration order, however, hit a roadblock when a federal judge today issued an emergency order temporarily barring authorities from deporting refugees and other visa holders who have been detained. \n \nEarlier, a senior Administration official also pushed back on the notion that the controversial executive order was a Muslim ban. \n \nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the official listed off several predominantly Muslim countries that the order does not apply to. \n \nThe official said the US still took in \u201cmore foreigners than any other country in the history of civilisation\u201d and that the number of people impacted by the executive order was relatively small. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\u201d the official said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the US,\u201d the official added. \n \nGreen Card holders from one of the seven affected countries who are currently outside the US will need a case by case waiver to return to America, according to the official. \n \nThose Green Card holders in the US will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, the official said. \n \nThe official said the administration is still working to define what \u201cin transit\u201d means for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the US but are currently in a third country. \n \n\u201cThe White House is aware of reports that Iran plans reciprocal steps in response to the executive order,\u201d the official said, adding if those measures are indeed reciprocal, it means that the Iranians will review each individual on a case by case basis. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive orders signed yesterday imposes a five year lobbying ban on administration officials and a lifetime ban on administration officials lobbying for a foreign country. \n \nThe other executive action calls on military leaders to present a report to the president in 30 days that outlines a strategy for defeating ISIS.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"\u2018It\u2019s not a Muslim ban\u2019: Donald Trump defends immigration order on refugees","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Siasat Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169680243","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Siasat Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.siasat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202509110","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:44Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trump-Muslims-US.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The role of the press, especially the political press, is to be skeptical of everything. To question everything. To refuse to get sucked into carrying water for politicians\u2019 narratives in exchange for access to supposed \u201cscoops.\u201d \n \nAnd it has been a week of unbridled skepticism \u2013 of questioning everything. \n \nWhen Trump claimed it stopped raining moments after he began his inaugural address, the press showed otherwise. \n \nWhen Trump claimed (again) that he lost the popular vote because millions of illegal immigrants voted, all the newscasts carried comments from Republicans and Democrats declaring it both outrageous and unsubstantiated. \n \nWhen Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, claimed that attendance at his inaugural was the highest in history, the press pounced again, with photos and video that showed it wasn\u2019t true. \n \nWhen presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and tried to argue that Spicer had simply been providing some \u201calternative facts\u201d to the media accounts, host Chuck Todd exploded. \n \n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d he yelled. \u201cAlternative facts? Alternative facts? Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts! They\u2019re falsehoods!\u201d \n \nAmen! Preach it, brother Todd! Speak truth to power! \n \nThese were not cosmic, world-shaking lies. They were more about Trump massaging his ego than the policy stuff that supposedly has millions of Americans \u201cterrified\u201d of his presidency. \n \nBut they are still important. There are no small lies, in my view. Someone who is willing to lie about small things will lie about big things. \n \nOne of the first lessons I learned from my journalistic mentor was that simply misspelling someone\u2019s name in a news story is a very big deal. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even spell somebody\u2019s name right, why should anybody trust anything else in the story?\u201d he said. \n \nThe same applies to what is frequently called political \u201cspin.\u201d If you shade the truth on something little, there is no reason to trust you on the big things. \n \nSo, good for the media for going after the lies. \n \nHowever \u2013 and it is a very big however \u2013 the problem for the press is that its sudden willingness to do the job it is supposed to do all the time is undermining its credibility even more than before. It makes it clear that it is personal. The press can\u2019t stand Trump, and it practically worshiped President Obama. \n \nSure, the media did some \u201cfact-checking\u201d of Obama. But overall, once they had reported on a lie, they dropped it. They were much more consistent, loud and repetitive about the \u201cprogressive\u201d narrative that those who opposed Obama were doing so simply because they were racists and bigots. \n \nPerhaps Obama\u2019s most famous lie was his declaration, multiple times, that \u201cif you like your health plan, you can keep your health plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\u201d \n \nPolitiFact, which is supposedly nonpartisan on truth as opposed to \u201calternative facts,\u201d finally got around to calling it the \u201clie of the year\u201d in 2013, after concluding six previous times that it was true. \n \nBut I don\u2019t recall the host of any major mainstream news show like \u201cMeet the Press\u201d yelling at a presidential spokesperson about spreading \u201cfalsehoods\u201d about something vastly more significant than attendance at an inaugural. \n \nAs long as we\u2019re all supposed to be \u201cterrified\u201d about Trump promising to enforce immigration laws, why weren\u2019t we hearing much more about the truly terrifying scandal of the Obama administration - the IRS selecting conservative groups for special scrutiny, and lengthy delays, in determining their tax-exempt status? \n \nThe most powerful federal agency in the country was targeting groups for their political beliefs. You\u2019d think the press would have latched onto that like a pit bull, which is what it would have done had Trump had been president and the target was liberal groups. \n \nNot with Obama as president. Sure, media reported that Lois Lerner, the IRS director of exempt organizations, took the Fifth numerous times when called before Congress. But few reported on the preposterous story lines that emerged, of \u201clost\u201d emails. Or that she was never fired but simply \u201casked to resign,\u201d and refused, so was then placed on paid leave. She retired shortly after that with a full pension. \n \nNo speaking truth to power about that. No insistent, ongoing questions about why nobody was held accountable. It all went away. \n \nI don\u2019t recall any mainstream media stars yelling about Obama\u2019s demonstrably false claim in the final months of his presidency that his administration had been free of scandal. That \u201calternative fact\u201d is apparently OK. \n \nMuch the same was true about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s multiple lies about her use of a private email server. Yes, the Washington Post (not a right-wing news outlet) did list them in a post by its fact checker. \n \nBut Clinton challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, got vastly more press when he said during a debate, \u201cthe American people are sick of hearing about your damn emails.\u201d \n \nWhether they were sick of it or not, the press endlessly replayed that line, so the American people would know what to think. \n \nMost Americans, including Trump supporters, want the press to do its job. But if those in the media want to restore some credibility, they need to admit that they didn\u2019t do it very well for the past eight years. \n \nTaylor Armerding is an independent columnist.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get.

Savage cracked that code with its A17, which is a big part of why it won the 2016 American Hunter Golden Bullseye Award for Rifle of the Year. Why\u2019s that important?

But I\u2019ve been through some rough shit in the last few years\u2014just personal mountains that I\u2019ve had to climb and in my opinion, that helped me decide exactly where I want to be. It made me see exactly how trivial everything is and made me only care about the stuff that really matters.\u201d \n \nOn current trends and defining meaning \n\u201cI think trends work in a circle. And everything that\u2019s trendy now, had been trendy before. The only new trends in my opinion are ones created in technology that didn\u2019t exist before. But human expression in terms of clothing, design, and art, even if it\u2019s new, is a recreation of something in the past. Because the human mind hasn\u2019t really evolved in the last 200 years.\u201d \n \nOn what he considers valuable \n\u201cWhat I think is valuable is the stuff that\u2019s inspiring everything. Like if you look back to the original\u2014and even the originals are interpretations of something else\u2014it almost works in the way a virus spreads. This person gets the idea, and they took it from something they noticed in their childhood or in the culture where they\u2019re from, they do something with that, and then people all over the world see it because of the internet. Then that keeps spanning out and it dilutes itself and changes. It\u2019s like a game of telephone.\u201d \n \nOn Vetements \nBut when you look at synthetic Vetements and then the real thing, you really see how the real thing is special. No matter what brand tries to do a heavyweight sweatshirt, no one is as heavy as Vetements\u2019. And, in my opinion, Vetements isn\u2019t even streetwear. People just term it that because you see all these hypebeasts in their hoodies, or in their fake hoodies.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Marcus Cho"},"topics":[],"title":"Mike the Ruler Talks About the Roots of Fashion\u2019s Perpetual \u201990s Rehash With SSENSE","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe","countryCode":"DE","country":"Germany"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Highsnobiety","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"411071377","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4627"},"name":"Highsnobiety","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Fashion"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://highsnobiety.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.instagram.com/miketheruler/?hl=en"],"sequenceId":"695202514462","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T09:14:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/27233841/Mike-The-Ruler-SSENSE-1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Horry","zipCode":"29578","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Myrtle Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657695","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1140"},"name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202518207","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The prevalence of type two diabetes is growing at a frightening rate and we are seeing younger patients with this type of diabetes, which was almost unheard of 20 years ago. \n \nDiabetes can have a devastating effect on the leg and foot. Today, I want to share two stories with you about what my patients have experienced. \n \nPATIENT ONE \n \nWe shall call this young lady Jane for the sake of the article. Jane was a 35-year-old teacher who was an insulin-dependent diabetic. She had been diagnosed at age 13 with type one diabetes. This is where the pancreas stops producing insulin. It is often diagnosed in early childhood and the cause is not yet known. \n \nThe condition had left her with severe numbness in her feet (neuropathy). One evening while dining at home with her family, she became aware of a burning smell. Jane couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on where the smell was coming from. \n \nShe sent one of her children to the kitchen to check if she had left anything on the stove. It was turned off. \n \nThe smell became progressively worse and after about five minutes, her youngest child looked under the table. She screamed out in horror when the source of the burning smell was discovered. \n \nFor the entire meal, Jane\u2019s foot had been resting on a lit mosquito coil and it had literally burnt a hole through her flesh. Jane could not feel a thing due to the neuropathy, even when she looked at her burning flesh. \n \nShe washed the foot with cool water and wrapped it in a bandage and decided to visit me the next day. \n \nNow, what she should have done was to go to her local hospital for emergency treatment, but because of how late it was when the incident occurred and having to take care of two young children, she left it until the following day. \n \nWhen she arrived at my office her foot was swollen, infected and hot to the touch, but Jane could not feel a thing. Of course, this gave her a false sense of security. \n \nIt took four months of intense treatment to heal the foot. Luckily, she only needed to have one toe amputated. Had she waited longer to seek assistance the situation could have been more grave. However, if she had attended the hospital on the night of the injury, we could have been able to save the toe. \n \nThe moral of this story is to immediately seek help if you have any injury or problem with your feet and you are diabetic. \n \nTo be able to feel pain is a defence mechanism. It warns you of danger and alerts you to injury. If you lose your pain sensation you become vulnerable. This can be as simple as a pair of shoes rubbing against a toe where the patient cannot feel it. This can ultimately lead to amputation. \n \nBe aware of your surroundings; wear supportive, roomy footwear and check your feet for injury every night. \n \nPATIENT TWO \n \nWe will call patient two John. John had type two diabetes, which means there is insulin resistance in the cells of the body. \n \nThe cause includes obesity, hereditary factors, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle. John was a well-controlled diabetic patient. He was fairly well educated in the knowledge of how to look after his feet. He knew it was important never to go barefoot as he had neuropathy and could not feel anything up to his ankles. \n \nOne day he went up a ladder to pick fruits from a tree in his yard. As he finished he jumped down the last steps and headed towards the house. He kicked off one of his yard slippers and put his foot in his house slipper. As he tried to kick off the other slipper he noticed that it wouldn\u2019t come off. \n \nHe looked down to see a six-inch nail poking through the top of his shoe and it had wedged his shoe to his foot. He felt no pain at all. \n \nJohn sensibly wrapped the foot with the shoe and nail still attached in a towel and took a taxi straight to the hospital. That night he underwent surgery and his foot was saved. \n \nHe attended my office for the next few months for follow-up treatment and now he is fit and healthy. \n \nThis story had a great outcome. John sought immediate medical help when he saw how serious the situation was. The advice from this story is similar to the last. Wear the appropriate footwear for the job at hand. A flimsy pair of flip-flops were obviously not adequate. \n \nThe good thing is that he sought treatment immediately and didn\u2019t try to deal with the situation himself. I have seen patients over the years who have had a very bad cut and have been trying to self-treat. With the diabetic patient this will often lead to infection and possible amputation. \n \nIn my next article I will focus on how to protect your feet and diabetic foot health education. \n \nAngela Davis BSc (Hons) DPodM MChS is a podiatrist with offices in Montego Bay (293- 7119), Mandeville (962-2100), Ocho Rios (974-6339), Kingston (978-8392), and Savanna-la-Mar (955-3154).

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Let\u2019s see what he has been up to. \n \nGareth weighed in at 482 pounds on Januray 24, 26 pounds down from the 508 pounds he weighed in September 2016. When we last checked in with Gareth, he had lost 27 pounds since his start date. \n \nStill reeling from the holiday period that was compounded by his duties as a chef and his effort to deliver superior products for his Christmas cake catering business, this masked a bigger problem \u2014 his food addiction. \n \nBeing faced with food all day has been tough mentally for Gareth, but he is seemingly getting stronger everyday. \n \nAs a result of the constant battle, Gareth gained a few pounds, causing him to slip on his weight loss target, but the coaching by Selena DeLeon of Core Fitness Studios has helped him to get back on his feet and drive his heels down in a new resolution for 2017. \n \nThe support of the followers on social media and from those people who recognise him everywhere he goes has also helped him to regain his mindset and get himself back on track. \n \nOver the 10 days prior to his weigh-in on January 24, Gareth lost five pounds. This was due largely to him eating on time, every 3.5 to 4 hours, increasing his water intake, and committing to walking four days per week. \n \nGareth is now so excited about his progress that he has added a fifth day at the beach where he swims, walks in the water and in the sand for an extra burn. The activity also helps him with his blood circulation problems, which he has developed as a result of the excess weight. \n \nHis carbohydrate portions are now carefully measured \u2014 no more than two fingers of green banana per meal \u2014 and the meats are slowly transitioning from stewed, which is his trade specialty, to grilled and baked instead. \n \nHe needs the daily contact with his coach to stay on top of things, and this communication has helped him tremendously. He knows that he has a weakness, so he keeps his daily food diary and sends it in every night as a rule so that he is held to account. This his has been the one thing that has really made the difference over the 10-day period. \n \nThis is the time of year when most people battle to uphold their new year\u2019s weight loss resolutions and maybe feel the confines of their commitments around about now. One thing that we can remember is that when we feel that we are struggling with our own hurdles of pounds to lose, there is always someone else out there who has to dig even deeper. The support that we all can show Gareth is helping to lift him up out of a place where he sometimes feels deeply trapped, and this also serves us to know that our own goals are also possible. \n \nTake heart in knowing that if it is possible for Gareth to overcome this fight, it is possible for you too. \n \nYour support goes a long way in helping to keep Gareth going on his #journeyof100pounds. Use the hashtag and log on to the \n \nJamaica Observer social media as well as Core Fitness Studios to throw your support behind this young man\u2019s journey back to health and a better life.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Gareth gets back on track","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202520946","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n \nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon\u2019s first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n \nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n \n12:30 a.m. \n \nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n \nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley\u2019s No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n \nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n \nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n \nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n \nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n \nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n \nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n \n\u201cThat time in the rain for me went better,\u201d said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \u201cYou can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n \n\u201cIt is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\u201d \n \nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n \nPatricio O\u2019Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n \nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing\u2019s No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n \nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He\u2019s part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n \nHe\u2019s running in this year\u2019s endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n \nSo why is he giving up racing? \n \n\u201cI am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there\u2019s no time to do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n \n\u201cThere is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\u201d \n \nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n \nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n \n\u201cThat would be everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\u201d \n \n8:15 p.m. \n \nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world\u2019s largest slip and slide. \n \nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n \nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n \n7:15 p.m. \n \nAustin Cindric\u2019s meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n \nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday\u2019s twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he\u2019s ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n \nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n \n\u201cThey trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I\u2019m very grateful for that opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I represented myself well.\u201d \n \nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n \n\u201cNever thought I\u2019d be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\u201d Tim Cindric wrote. \n \nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR\u2019s Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He\u2019ll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n \n\u201cI drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it\u2019s what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don\u2019t want to be specialized. \n \n\u201cI want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\u201d \n \n__ \n \n6:15 p.m. \n \nJeff Gordon\u2019s first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n \nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n \n\u201cI just don\u2019t have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know which way to go.\u201d \n \nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \u201cthat was the wrong move.\u201d He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n \n\u201cI wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\u201d \n \nGordon\u2019s teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n \n\u201cEveryone was telling me, \u2018Build a gap, build a gap,'\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn\u2019t get to get in the car. That would be the worst. \u2026 The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn\u2019t how it ended up working out.\u201d \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nScott Pruett\u2019s shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n \nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he\u2019s helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n \nHe wasn\u2019t sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n \n\u201cWe were just putting in the hours, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing \u2019cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\u201d \n \nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n \n\u201cThis is not how you want to start,\u201d he said. \n \n4:20 p.m. \n \nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n \nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n \nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n \nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year\u2019s banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford\u2019s historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n \nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 50 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202521641","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But a range of local companies, from logistics providers to auto auctioneers, say they\u2019re keeping an eye on the situation. \n \n Story continues below gallery  \n \n\u201cWe have 500 drivers, so it\u2019s something we watch pretty closely,\u201d said Ryan Schwalbach, CEO of Indianapolis-based Now Courier Co. \n \nThe company, which offers delivery, warehousing and logistics services, also has offices in Evansville, Fort Wayne, Merrillville and South Bend, as well as in Louisville and Cincinnati. \n \nWith the economy doing well, Schwalbach said, the company already is in the midst of a \u201csevere drought\u201d of drivers. \n \nWhen gas prices go up, he said, it becomes even harder to recruit drivers because Now\u2019s drivers are independent contractors who pay for their own fuel and vehicle expenses. \n \nMost of Now\u2019s customers pay a fuel surcharge that kicks in when gas reaches $2.10 a gallon. That surcharge is a percentage of the overall delivery fee, Schwalbach said, and as gas prices increase, so does the surcharge. But he said the surcharge isn\u2019t enough to fully reimburse drivers for their increased fuel costs. \n \nSchwalbach said he doesn\u2019t expect a return to the record-high $3.62-a-gallon average from 2012, but he believes prices could climb close to $3 a gallon. \n \nAccording to the Energy Information Administration\u2019s Short-Term Energy Outlook, issued monthly, the national average for unleaded gasoline this year is expected to be $2.38 per gallon, rising to $2.41 in 2018. Diesel prices are expected to rise, too \u2014 from $2.31 per gallon last year to $2.73 this year, and $2.84 in 2018. \n \n\u201cWe kind of reached a low point with all prices at the beginning of 2016,\u201d said Sean Hill, an economist with the Energy Information Administration. \n \nSupply and demand \n \nPrices for gasoline, diesel and oil all fell in recent years because their supplies grew faster than demand, Hill said. But U.S. production declined over the past year, he added, and overseas production is expected to drop this year.Companies across central Indiana, a hotbed for the transportation and logistics industries, will feel the consequences of higher fuel costs if predictions come true. \n \n\u201cWe pay very close attention\u201d to fuel prices, said Chip Edgington, vice president of operations at Fullbeauty Brands, an e-commerce firm selling plus-size women\u2019s clothing through a variety of websites, including Woman Within, Roaman\u2019s, Jessica London and Swimsuitsforall. \n \nThe company is based in New York City but has significant operations in Indianapolis, including about 170 corporate employees and another 500 or so at distribution centers in Indianapolis and Plainfield. \n \nEdgington is also chairman of Conexus Indiana, an Indianapolis-based organization focused on strengthening the state\u2019s advanced manufacturing and logistics sectors. \n \nFuel prices have an impact on shipping prices, which affect a wide range of companies, Edgington said. \n \nThe cost of fuel is \u201cgoing to go up, but is it going to be sustained?\u201d he said. \u201cIs it going to be significant? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d \n \nFullbeauty imports its goods from overseas via shipping containers, and its per-container shipping cost includes a fuel surcharge. \n \nShipping costs are also a factor on the other end, as Fullbeauty delivers its clothing to consumers. The apparel company uses FedEx, Edgington said, and the companies work together to each absorb some of the delivery cost. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do (to prepare) other than establish strong relationships with transportation partners and try to figure out where the meeting point is,\u201d he said. \n \nMark DeFabis, CEO of Plainfield-based logistics company Integrated Distribution Services, said transportation costs \u201care inevitably going to go up\u201d \u2014 driven in part by higher fuel prices. \n \nDeFabis is chairman of Conexus\u2019 Indiana Logistics Council and of the International Warehouse and Logistics Association. \n \nIDS specializes in logistics for e-commerce companies. When shippers like UPS and FedEx charge more to cover their increased fuel costs, some of that gets passed down the line to IDS\u2019 clients. It\u2019s the logistics company\u2019s job to help mitigate that pain. \n \nThat might involve helping clients redesign their packaging, rethink where they ship products from, or bundle shipping so they can get volume discounts. \n \n\u2018A bit of skepticism\u2019 \n \nA sustained increase in gas prices would ripple through the used-car market, including Carmel-based KAR Auction Services. KAR runs auto auctions and provides related services, such as funding for used-car dealers.Fuel prices crept up in December and early January in response to news that OPEC countries, along with Russia, pledged to cut back on oil production, said Tom Kontos, chief economist for ADESA Analytical Services, a KAR business unit. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m casting a bit of skepticism about whether the supply curtailments will actually happen,\u201d Kontos said. \u201cThis situation won\u2019t necessarily be dramatic going forward.\u201d \n \nKAR\u2019s customers are wholesalers who buy cars for resale. When gas prices go up dramatically and continually \u2014 say, 50 cents over several weeks \u2014 KAR sees stronger demand for compact cars. Likewise, the reseller sees more interest in pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles when fuel prices fall. \n \nBut the situation is complex, Kontos said, and fuel prices aren\u2019t the only factor. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s just like a stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the value of used vehicles fluctuate based on all known news at that moment.\u201d \n \nAnd changes in the vehicle industry itself are making gas prices a less reliable indicator of vehicle demand, Kontos said. \n \nWhen gas prices sometimes passed $4 several years ago, he said, both consumers and manufacturers lost their taste for large vehicles. \n \nThe situation is different today, Kontos said, because technology and lighter parts mean even large vehicles are more fuel-efficient. And with the rise in crossover vehicles, there\u2019s less of a distinction than there used to be between, say, passenger vehicles and SUVs. \n \nSome business and government units are blunting the impact of price swings by locking in prices. \n \nFor example, in December, IndyGo inked a 12-month diesel fuel contract with Avon-based Co-Alliance LLP. The $3.1 million deal allows the bus service to buy up to 1.7 million gallons of diesel fuel at $1.78 per gallon. \n \nThat should cover about 80 percent of IndyGo\u2019s fuel needs this year, said spokesman Bryan Luellen. \n \nIndyGo started using fuel contracts a few years back, Luellen said, when prices were fluctuating wildly. \n \n\u201cThis has been our strategy for several years, to evaluate the market and lock in when it\u2019s advantageous,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cThe fluctuations are really damaging to the business, and we need predictability.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Indianapolis news","group":"US regional"}],"title":"Pain at the pump: Gas prices heading up after years of decline","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bartholomew","zipCode":"47201","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbus","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Columbus Republic","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657345","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"993"},"name":"Columbus Republic","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.therepublic.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202523147","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mike Wolanin | The Republic \n    \n\u201cI was still crying after the pain was gone just because I was scared,\u201d Patberg said. \u201cI know that a pop comes with an ACL injury, so I knew that\u2019s what it was. But I was scared because I didn\u2019t want it to be that.\u201d \n \nPatberg, like Huffman and Norman, are Columbus North girls basketball players. All tore their ACLs within three months of each other last summer, and all have missed at least part of this season. \n \nBecause Patberg\u2019s injury did not happen until September \u2014 during a soccer practice \u2014 and because she\u2019s a junior, doctors advised her not to rush the knee to try to get back this basketball season. She does not plan to play soccer this fall and is focused on getting back for next basketball season. \n \nHuffman, a senior, and Norman, a junior, meanwhile, are back in their familiar roles for a North team that will host its sectional beginning Tuesday and concluding on Saturday. Huffman, who tore the ACL in her left knee July 8 while playing with the Skye Diggs Elite AAU team, missed the Bull Dogs\u2019 first five games before returning to her starting point guard spot. \n \nPreviously, Huffman had torn the ACL in her right knee while at Franklin Central before transferring to North. Then last February, she tore the meniscus in her right knee during the regional. \n \n\u201cBut even now that I\u2019m back playing, you get stuck in stuff, and some habits form that aren\u2019t always the best and it gets frustrating sometimes, like \u2018Will I ever be back to where I was?\u2019\u201d Huffman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of that that goes through your mind. But I know from my previous ACL, I made it back to where I was before that, so that helped a lot with my confidence, knowing that I can get there again.\u201d \n \nNorman tore her ACL on July 23 while playing for the Indiana Faith AAU team. The junior forward was along the baseline, and a teammate threw a low pass from the top of the key. Norman tried to catch it and landed awkward, and the knee popped. \n \nSince making a brief appearance in the North Invitational just before Christmas, Norman has seen increased playing time coming off the bench. \n \n\u201cI was really upset (with the injury) because I had been working hard all summer, trying to get better and getting in shape,\u201d Norman said. \u201cThen, when I got hurt, it was just kind of a bummer to know that hard work might not have paid off, or I might not be able to continue for awhile and have to redo everything.\u201d \n \nAnatomy of the knee \n \nThe ACL is in the center of the knee. Its main function is to stop the tibia from sliding forward when the knee stops. It is not used in straight-line running.\u201cI always liken the ACL to a seat belt,\u201d said Dr. Cary Guse, a surgeon with Southern Indiana Orthopedics. \u201cYou have it on at all times in the car, but it\u2019s not always used. There are many times when an ACL is not being used at all.\u201d \n \nWhen injured, the ACL can tear off the top side of the bone (the femur) or the bottom bone (the tibia) or can just tear in half. \n \nIf the ACL is not functioning and is torn, it will not recover. The knee will shift and give out. \n \nGuse said some middle-aged and older people can get by without an ACL since they\u2019re not running, jumping or shifting as much as young athletes. He said it would be atypical to return to high-level athletics with a torn ACL. \n \nGirls at higher risk \n \nGuse said there\u2019s no question that females have risk factors that can\u2019t easily be changed. He said girls are three to seven times more likely to tear an ACL than boys.Girls have a wider pelvis than boys, which causes a higher knee angle that puts more force on the ACL. Guse said females also are quad-dominant, which also puts more stress on the ACL. \n \nDr. Ilya Schwartzman, who doubles as the East girls soccer coach, agreed that these factors tend to put girls at greater risk. He has had players of all shapes and sizes tear their ACLs. \n \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter the build,\u201d he said. \u201cSoccer, because there\u2019s so much change of direction and stop-and-go-action and pressure on the knee, it happens. It\u2019s a risk that every athlete takes when they play sports.\u201d \n \nGuse said single-sport athletes also have a higher risk of injury than multi-sport athletes since they are using the same muscles over and over again. \n \nColumbus North girls basketball coach Pat McKee, who lost two of his players during summer basketball, thinks specialization might be a factor. He said the injuries tend to happen more on the summer AAU circuit where teams are playing game after game after game, putting more stress on players\u2019 knee ligaments. \n \n\u201cIs there adequate rest time? Is there adequate re-warmup time when you\u2019re in the second or third game of the day? I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s as much monitoring of that in a summer environment as there is in a winter school environment,\u201d McKee said. \n \nAfflicting the stars \n \nPossibly the two most accomplished female athletes ever to come out of Columbus haven\u2019t been able to avoid an ACL tear. \n \nSoccer player Morgan Proffitt was out of action about four months, while basketball player Ali Patberg missed an entire year. \n \nProffitt tore her ACL playing club soccer the summer before her senior year at North, calling it the worst pain of her life for about 10 seconds. She returned on senior night and played in the sectional, then enjoyed a stellar four-year career at Marquette University that was capped by selection as Big East Defensive Player of the Year. \n \nEarlier this month, Proffitt was selected in the second round of the Women\u2019s Professional Soccer League by the Chicago Red Stars. She said missing most of her senior year in high school wasn\u2019t easy. \n \n\u201cI hadn\u2019t been majorly injured up until that point. So to be out four to six months, that\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d Proffitt said. \u201cI had to do my rehab while they were out competing. It\u2019s definitely tough mentally and physically.\u201d \n \nAli Patberg, who is Kelsey\u2019s cousin, tore her ACL on Nov. 2, 2015, during preseason practice at Notre Dame. That happened just six months after leading the Bull Dogs to the Class 4A state title and earning Indiana Miss Basketball and McDonald\u2019s All-American honors. \n \nWhile working out with the team last summer, Ali Patberg began experiencing pain. She had a second surgery Aug. 3 to remove bone spurs from her surgically repaired right knee. \n \nFinally, Patberg returned to the court when Notre Dame practice began in October. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very long process,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gets better every day. I didn\u2019t play basketball for about a year, so it\u2019s rough.\u201d \n \nAli Patberg said she\u2019s not back to 100 percent yet, but she\u2019s close, noting that she has started to be more aggressive offensively and is moving well laterally on defense. \n \nSince coming back from a case of pneumonia that sidelined her for 2½ weeks and allowed the knee time to rest, Patberg has been playing without a knee brace that she wore at the beginning of the season. \n \n\u201cThe biggest part to the whole thing is mentally thinking you\u2019re OK,\u201d Patberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t even realize in a game that I tore my ACL. That\u2019s where you mentally get over the hump.\u201d \n \nPrevention and rehab \n \nSeveral years ago, North teamed with Columbus Regional Hospital to do an ACL prevention program for volleyball and basketball players. Players went through exercises designed to prevent ACL injuries every day before or after practice for six weeks.Guse said the biggest preventative measure is quad strength and making sure athletes have two equally strong legs \u2014 not one good leg and one bad leg. If they\u2019re landing in a knock-kneed position, there is much more force. \n \nThe prevention programs are designed to make the quads stronger and make sure the athlete is landing balanced \u2014 not on one leg more than the other \u2014 and with the knees straight up and down. \n \nGuse said the thinking was that if they do exercises such as hamstring curls for 5 or 10 minutes a day, they might minimize that risk. To his knowledge, nobody in that pilot prevention program at North tore their ACL that year. \n \nMeanwhile, Schwartzman began putting his girls soccer teams through plyometric and strengthening programs about 10 years ago. The plan worked \u2014 at the beginning. \n \n\u201cAfter initiating it, we had a few years of no injuries, and we thought we were onto something,\u201d Schwartzman said. \u201cBut then we had it again. Unfortunately, they still keep occurring, despite the best intentions to prevent it.\u201d \n \nPeople who tear their ACLs are at risk of tearing the same ACL or the one in the opposite knee. Guse cited a study by the Moon Group, a collaboration of ACL experts across the country, that showed a 7 percent to 10 percent recurrent rate nationally. \n \nFollowing surgery, Guse puts patients through six stages or rehab \u2014 swelling control, range of motion, strength, balance, sport-specific movements and explosion. A lot of the rehabilitation centers around getting rid of the recurrent risk factors that they can. \n \nThe long road back \n \nLike her first ACL surgery 2½ years ago, Huffman\u2019s absence from the court lasted about four months following her latest surgery.\u201cI\u2019m very, very thankful for that because you have to have a lot of things go right for a four-month recovery, and I have a mom who\u2019s a physical therapist, which was extremely helpful,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cThe first month is definitely the hardest in therapy. If you can get through that, you can get through almost anything after that.\u201d \n \nNorman was out for 15 weeks following her surgery. She said she could gradually do more and more exercised with every rehab appointment she attended. \n \nKelsey Patberg, who is 4½ months removed from her injury, has been cleared to run and jump but not practice. \n \nHuffman, who last week committed to play at Cedarville (Ohio) University, admitted she sometimes thinks about her surgically-repaired knees when she\u2019s out on the court. She hopes to get back to being as aggressive as she was before the latest injury. \n \n\u201cSometimes, I\u2019ll be sitting in a timeout, and be like, \u2018What if this is the next play that is another knee injury?\u2019\u201d Huffman said. \u201cOn the court, I\u2019ll tweak it sometimes and get a little nervous.\u201d \n \nNorman, meanwhile, said she usually doesn\u2019t think about her injury. \n \n\u201cI just go out there and play, and it usually doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d she said. \u201cI just try to play as hard as I can and do whatever I can to help my teammates and just play hard and work on my conditioning and get better.\u201d \n \nBoth Norman and Huffman said they\u2019re glad to be done with rehab and are happy to be back on the court. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a new love for the game when you\u2019re out for that long,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, but when you get back, even when things aren\u2019t going your way, it\u2019s good to be able to take a step back and say, \u2018At least I\u2019m playing.\u2019\u201d \n \nIncidence rates of high school sports injuries \n  \nA Journal of Athletic Training High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study from the 2007-08 through 2011-12 school years lists girls basketball as having the highest rate of ACL injuries as a proportion to all injuries in that sport.

You meet new people. You experience wonderful things, and it's all with the book held in your own hand.\" \n\nFor Edie Bustle and her husband Larry, reading is an important part of their lives \u2014 both volunteer in the community reading to children. In fact, former Manatee County Commissioner Larry Bustle says that in retirement, his occupation is reading. \n\n\"We both love to read,\" Edie Bustle said. \"This was a wonderful way to pay back and see kids read as opposed to play games on the computer.\" \n\nAs a way to ensure more of today's youth become lifelong learners, the Bustles are hoping that the upcoming \"An Evening with Nicholas Sparks\" event, which they are co-chairing, will be a success. Proceeds from the Feb. 7 event at Neel Performing Arts Center benefit Manatee Library System's \"I Am a Lifelong Learner\" program. \n\n\"It's a great way to support the library system in Manatee County and I think we are both very supportive of the lifelong learning project that the library foundation and the library is promoting,\" Larry Bustle said. \n\nWith tickets still available for the Sparks event, there are some ticket promotions \u2014 a 2-for-1 ticket special and a $25 ticket promotion for educators as well as Manatee County high school and Manatee/Sarasota college students. For tickets, call 941-216-8746. \n\n\"The Library Foundation's fund-raising efforts for this event are aimed at improving literacy in Manatee County through excellent library service,\" said Susan Wilcox, foundation event chairwoman. \"This year we are delighted to have the opportunity to offer a position of our seating to educators and to other literacy advocates in our community at a reduced rate. It is one small gesture to let these literacy partners and providers know how important they are and how much we appreciate their life's work.\" \n\nThe Sparks event is the third such program, which has previously brought authors Stephen King and John Grisham to town and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the county's library system. \n\n\"The money raised from this event is going to go into the lifelong learner program,\" Edie Bustle said. \"We strongly support that, and reading is one of the most important things a child ever learns to do because it opens so many doors.\" \n\nThe library's \"I Am a Lifelong Learner\" literacy program \"aims to improve literacy by targeting the area's youngest readers by providing a Lifelong Learner Campaign Coordinator to meet families at the point-of-need and offer outreach programs to develop literacy skills,\" a news release states. \n\nThe focus is getting students to read at grade level by third grade, Larry Bustle said. \n\n\"Prior to third grade, you are learning to read. After grade three, you are reading to learn,\" he said. \n\nAs a former commissioner, Larry Bustle said there is just not enough money to do all the things that are needed. \n\n\"That's going to go a long way to help lifelong learners,\" he said of the event. \n\nSince the announcement that Sparks would be speaking at the event, the Bustles have been diving into his novels as well as watching \"The Notebook.\" \n\nOn Wednesday morning, three of Sparks' books \u2014 \"The Last Song,\" \"A Walk to Remember\" and \"Message in a Bottle\" \u2014 were on the Bustles' coffee table. \n\n\"This one is another happy yet sad book,\" Edie Bustle said of \"Message in a Bottle.\" \"I really like this one \u2014 and the ending was a surprise.\" \n\nFor the Bustles, it came as a surprise that they would be co-chairs of the event, which comes just after Larry Bustle finished his time in public service and Edie Bustle ended her time on the Library Board of Trustees. \n\n\"That was a big surprise,\" Edie Bustle said. \n\nLarry added: \"It was.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CLAIRE ARONSONThe Bradenton Herald"},"topics":[],"title":"Couple ensures today's youth become lifelong learners","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Manatee","zipCode":"34205","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bradenton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bradenton Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657775","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"626"},"name":"Bradenton Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bradenton.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202528774","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n \nTrump\u2019s order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \u201cgreen cards\u201d or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n \nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n \nIt\u2019s not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n9:40 p.m. \n \nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. \n \nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n \nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n \nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n \nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n \n7 p.m. \n \nNew York City\u2019s Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. \n \nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn\u2019t have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n \nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n \nShe says her mother-in-law\u2019s sister had been detained. \n \nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n \nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n \n1 a.m. \n \nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister\u2019s praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \u201cPresident Trump is right\u201d for building a wall. \n \n\u201cI built a wall along Israel\u2019s southern border,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\u201d \n \nMexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \u201cprofound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister\u2019s message on Twitter\u201d to Israel\u2019s ambassador. \u201cMexico is Israel\u2019s friend and should be treated as such.\u201d \n \n____ \n \n12:20 a.m. \n \nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \u201cis not a Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it\u2019s \u201cworking out very nicely.\u201d \n \nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n \nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \n12:10 a.m. \n \nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration order. \n \nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n \nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn\u2019t proceed on flights to the U.S. \n \nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn\u2019t complete their trips. \n \nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n \n____ \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country\u2019s decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n \nZarif says on Twitter: \u201cUnlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\u201d \n \nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n \n____ \n \n11:20 p.m. \n \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n \nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\u201d \n \nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\u2019s airport. \n \nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n \nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n \nMore than 75 percent of Canada\u2019s exports are to the U.S. \n \n10:20 p.m. \n \nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \u201cthe land of freedom\u201d after being released from custody. \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n \nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n \nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n \nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\u201d \n \n9:50 p.m. \n \nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States\u2019 new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n \n\u201cI am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\u201d said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n \nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n \n\u201cHis intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\u201d said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \u201cBut you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\u201d \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nIran\u2019s foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n \nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \u201ccounteraction\u201d to Trump\u2019s executive order. \n \nThe statement says: \u201cIran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\u201d \n \nThe statement adds: \u201cIt will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\u201d \n \nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n \n8 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n \nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n \nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n \nThe officials said Saturday\u2019s action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n7:05 p.m. \n \nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n \nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM\u2019s press office, said: \u201cWe would love to bring them there. That\u2019s not the problem.

They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n \nThe official says there\u2019s an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it\u2019s unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n \nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n \nThe official wasn\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump\u2019s order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n6:35 p.m. \n \nIsrael\u2019s leader has endorsed President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel\u2019s wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n \n\u201cPresident Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel\u2019s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\u201d he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n \nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n \nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls\u2019 education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n \nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria\u2019s civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n \nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \u201cnot to turn his back on the world\u2019s most defenseless children and families.\u201d \n \nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \u201chelped build your country.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s mother was born in Scotland. \n \n5:15 p.m. \n \nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n \nA statement on the company\u2019s website says: \u201cNationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen \u2026 may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\u201d \n \nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n \n3 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport. \n \nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n2:45 p.m. \n \nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n \nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump\u2019s decision \u201cwill not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\u201d \n \nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won\u2019t harm national security. \n \nEgeland says the decision dealt a \u201cmortal blow\u201d to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution.

Now living in Cape Coral, Celia Rubin is committed to her promise that she'll continue to tell her father's story until her last breath in hopes of preventing another genocide. \n\n\"Hate teaches hate,\" she said. \"... Any tool I have I will use to stop that. I will keep talking. I will keep showing.\" \n\nAs Holocaust Remembrance Day dawns Friday, the world pauses to reflect on the mass slaughter of European civilians by the Nazis during World War II. Estimates indicate 6 million Jews died at their hands. The holiday's objective is to honor the deceased and surviving victims as well as promote awareness of the Holocaust. \n\n\"The only promise I ever made to my father is that we will never forget,\" said Rubin, who works as a business system analyst-project coordinator at Lee Health. Benjamin Rubin died at 80 in 1998. She frequently talks to middle school and high school students as part of history classes in the region he came to call home. But she doesn't limit herself to students. \n\nIt's the story of her father, whom she called \"Honey\", who was kind, generous and loved her beyond measure that she shares with anyone who'll listen. \n\nWhile she learned of the Holocaust growing up, it wasn't until her father had put it in the past that he shared details of one of humanity's darkest times, beer in hand and walking with her on the warm sands of Fort Myers Beach. He and his wife, Ann, made their retirement in Cape Coral, moving from Detroit in 1976. \n\nHe had rarely talked about the brutality he endured: family members disappearing, starvation, lice, attempting to keep warm using corpses, thwarted escape attempts met with torture and other horrors. \n\n\"People came out of the camps two ways: very bitter or glass half-full,\" Rubin said. Her father chose the glass half-full. \"He never let it influence him or how he treated anybody.\" \n\nStill she knew his years in the camps were bad. \n\nAs a child, blood-curdling screams often punctuated Celia Rubin's night. Night terrors included yelling and, less frequently, tears as memories surfaced in his sleep. \n\nLater, she learned the stories behind the screams: \n\n?After an escape attempt, guards cut off three fingers on his left hand up to the first knuckle. A tailor in the camp sewed the wound, stretching his skin over the bone. \n\n?As he was moved from camp to camp in open cattle cars, he and other victims used corpses to block the chill and stay alive. \n\n?While standing in a food line, he got clobbered with a ladle, sidelining him for two days and leaving a lump on his head for the rest of his life. \n\n?As liberation forces closed in on the Nazis, he and other prisoners were made to crush the bones left from crematoriums to hide evidence. \n\n?Made to march, those who fell would be shot. He stayed toward the front, where prisoners helped each other when they stumbled. \n\nRubin was part of a lawsuit against Germany for its complicity in the crimes against humanity, documenting his torture, backed by official Nazi records. \n\nHe also told his story as part of Shoah Foundation, a Steven Spielberg-backed project, in 1996. Shoah means \"the catastrophe.\" Two years before his death and a half-century removed from the camps, he shows the blurred number on his lower arm and recites it: 172066. As the interviewer attempts to draw him out, Rubin is sparing with the memories, saying the video will be what he leaves his children of the experience. He didn't talk with other Holocaust survivors about his experience, he said, because they already knew. \n\nLegacy Republic recently digitized it and put it on a secure online account, so Celia Rubin won't worry about losing it during her travels to schools or it wearing out. In it, her mother sums up Benjamin Rubin's legacy: \n\n\"Bennie is a wonderful father, a wonderful husband and, as a son in law, he could not be beat,\" Ann Rubin said on the recording. \"He's a good friend to people. He's a very understanding and compassionate person, and I was very lucky.\" \n\nThe digital memories help tell a story of a humble man who survived the most humbling of experiences, yet retained his humanity. \n\nHe arrived in New York City in 1949 with the clothes he was wearing, a spare shirt, a folder containing his important papers and a few dollars from the European Red Cross. He found a distant aunt who agreed to sponsor him in Detroit and went to work at a Jewish bakery. There, he met Ann, more than a decade younger than him. They had two children, Allen, and then Celia when Benjamin was 40. She was named for his mother, Allen for his father. \n\nThey lived in two-bedroom, one-bath home in a multicultural neighborhood. Benjamin clung to his faith, the family at temple every Friday and Saturday, and in later years, on the high holy days. The only time each year he didn't go to work was during Passover \u2014 when Jews eat unleavened bread. \n\nRubin had eight siblings. An orthodox family, their lives revolved around the temple in Sosnowiec. They worked in the trades: He was a baker like his father, others masons and tailors. Celia Rubin said her father called it a \"very happy life.\" At 18, he was forced into a Polish work camp, but in the video, he brushes it off as \"not so bad.\" He could go home for visits. Then, the guards started beating them. The food supplies dwindled.The Nazis took over the work camps. \n\nThe Polish government started confiscating businesses from the Jews. They shuttered the Rubins' bakery. \n\n\"They started moving people to the ghettos,\" Celia Rubin said. \"The roller coaster began. And that's history.\" \n\nBy twos and threes, his sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, parents and grandparents were taken away. It would be years before he learned all but one, his brother Harry, was killed. Another brother died two days before his camp's liberation. \n\nStill, in the Shoah Foundation video, Rubin smiles while recounting a memory: An American captain saw Rubin was barefoot and wearing a tattered striped uniform. He ordered a captured SS soldier to give Rubin his boots. \n\n\"You got good people, you got bad people,\" Rubin said. \n\nHe would have been 99 this year, and Celia Rubin thinks about him each day. \n\n\"He was a pretty amazing man,\" she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"STACEY HENSONThe News-Press"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Jewish news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Marked for life, Holocaust survivor's daughter honors Dad","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Manatee","zipCode":"34205","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bradenton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bradenton Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657775","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"626"},"name":"Bradenton Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bradenton.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202529745","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year.\n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market.\n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds.\n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period.\n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent.\n\nBonds are for fear\n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel.\n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again.\n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half.\n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER\n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVIS Chicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep.

The \"sanitized\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyzes and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian president ......(deleted),\" it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P.V. Narasimha Rao and V.P. Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the prime minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\" \n \nBesides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also analyzed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate - as we do - that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n \nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\" \n \n\"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\" among others, and their outcome. \n \n\"Although some of prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.  ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"CIA assessed Rajiv Gandhi assassination 5 years before he was killed!","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Manorama Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169870963","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"154"},"name":"Manorama Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.manoramaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202543938","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Ohrid region is one of them.\n\nOn the lake's Macedonian shores, the city of Ohrid is one of Europe's oldest human settlements with a wealth of Byzantine-style icons, frescoes and churches, which together with the lake's natural beauty drew more than 200,000 tourists last year.\n\n\"It's amazing. The beautiful thing is it's so close to nature,\" said visiting Polish student Aleksandra Walerych by the 13th-century Church of St John at Kaneo, which overlooks the lake and is thought to be the most photographed spot in the country.\n\nThe lake covers an area of 358 square kilometres (143 square miles), two-thirds of which lie in Macedonia and are covered by the World Heritage status and work is under way to try to extend this to the third lying in Albanian territory too.\n\nBut at its annual meeting in Istanbul in July last year, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee said it \"notes with concern that a number of large-scale infrastructure projects have been proposed\" on the Macedonian side.\n\nIt warned that Ohrid could find itself on the \"List of World Heritage in Danger\" if threats to the site were confirmed, suggesting alternative routes and locations should be identified for major projects.\n\nSites can lose their heritage status if they are deemed to be improperly protected.\n\nAlexandra Fiebig, project officer for Europe and North America at UNESCO's World Heritage Centre, told AFP there had been \"a lot of close contact with the (Macedonian) authorities\" and a UNESCO \"reactive monitoring mission\" was due to start work in Ohrid soon.\n\n- 'Political agendas' - Of the raft of controversial proposals, expected to involve both private and public investment, some fall under the remit of central government ministries while others are part of municipal plans.\n\nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a potential investor in the expressway, says it is \"assessing the feasibility\" of the project.\n\nMacedonia's conservative VMRO-DPMNE party, in power nationally since 2006, has been accused by critics of authoritarianism and corruption but narrowly won a general election in December.\n\nOhrid's mayor Nikola Bakraceski, from VMRO-DPMNE, insists environmental regulations have been followed and the public sufficiently consulted in city planning. He accuses activists of having \"political agendas\" and lacking expertise.\n\nHe told AFP that one of his priorities is finding resources for a 54-million-euro ($57.6-million) upgrade of the Ohrid area's antiquated and damaged waste collection system, in order to protect the lake.\n\nOn a national level, the government has prepared an \"action plan\" to implement the requests of the Istanbul meeting, said Lidija Topuzovska, the top Macedonian official for UNESCO matters, without giving specific details.\n\n\"The general intentions are that all standards for preserving the cultural and natural values of the Ohrid region are respected,\" she said.\n\nBut campaigners are not reassured.\n\nAnother citizens' group, Ohrid SOS, is campaigning to protect Studenchishte Marsh, the last remaining wetland by the lake.\n\nOne of its members, Macedonian scientist Nadezda Apostolova, has written in depth about the importance of the marsh -- both for its own biodiversity and its role in cleaning pollution flowing into the lake.\n\nA professor at Spain's University of Valencia, she says the wetland is already under \"severe attack\" from construction as trees are gradually replaced by concrete.\n\nActivists say they are not against all types of development, but want to see transparent plans that protect the \"jewel\" of the landlocked nation and keep it attractive to visitors.\n\n\"Everything is at risk with these developments,\" Apostolova said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rachel O'BRIEN"},"topics":[{"name":"Macedonia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Balkans news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Macedonians send out SOS from Europe's oldest lake","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MSN News US","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"530694805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN News US","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news.msn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202544556","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

So the skaters start again. \n\nNow, a community effort is underway to give Nipomo\u2019s skaters a permanent park of their own. \n\nTom Slater, a teacher at Mesa Middle School in Arroyo Grande, is championing building a skate park at Nipomo Community Park so skaters can congregate and practice there. \n\n\u201cAll sports are pretty much represented in Nipomo,\u201d Slater said. \u201cThere are fields for pretty much every sport you need. But skaters are treated like outsiders and not really in the mainstream, even though the things they are doing, they are the same as any athlete.\u201d \n\nNipomo is one of the only towns in the area without a skate park, Slater said, noting it has a population of about 20,000 people, three elementary schools, a middle school and two high schools. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen kids as young as seventh grade getting on the bus by themselves to go out to the San Luis Obispo skate park,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I wouldn\u2019t want my seventh-grader doing that, but there aren\u2019t many other options for them.\u201d \n\nThe idea for a skate park has long been floated at the county level, but was waylaid in recent years as the larger master plan for Nipomo Community Park faced legal resistance from residents concerned about water use and growth in town. \n\nSkaters are treated like outsiders and not really in the mainstream, even though the things they are doing, they are the same as any athlete. \n\nTom Slater, Mesa Middle School teacher \n\nNow the plan has finally cleared its last legal hurdle , and individual changes at the park \u2014 like the skating area \u2014 can begin. \n\nThe skate park has already been designed for free by Wormhoudt Inc. , which also designed the San Luis Obispo and Los Osos skate parks. \n\nThe design calls for a roughly10,000-square-foot concrete skate park next to the Nipomo Community Library (at the Tefft Street entrance to the community park). It would feature ramps, stairs and rails, as well as three bowls of different sizes. \n\nAll the community has to do now is raise the money to build it. \n\nThe park is estimated to cost about $1   million, Slater said. Part of that could be funded through grants or county support, he said, but a large portion will have to be donated by the community. \n\nSo far, Nipomo has raised about $600 via a T-shirt drive, and $720 through a GoFundMe page . The crowdfunding page has a goal of $20,000. \n\nSlater said he and others are in the process of reaching out to community members and groups to help spread the word for the necessity of the park and to garner donations and support. Eventually, he hopes the park will be the start of more recreational opportunities for Nipomo. \n\n\u201cIn Nipomo we love our kids, but unless you are on a team or you own a horse, there\u2019s just not much to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this will be the tip of the iceberg in bringing more things for the kids and the community to do.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kaytlyn Lesliekleslie@thetribunenews.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Nipomo skate park gets the go-ahead.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mclean","zipCode":"61701","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bloomington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WJBC AM 1230","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"545894772","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"114"},"name":"WJBC AM 1230","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wjbc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695202546647","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, when asked about Trump's plans for \"extreme vetting\", Marsudi said in social media message sent to Reuters: \"We have deep regrets about the policy.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. The idea drew fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution and later evolved into a proposal for \"extreme vetting\".\n\nMost of Indonesia's 220 million Muslims practise a moderate form of Islam, although the country has some vocal Islamist groups and has suffered in the past from attacks by militants.\n\nIndonesia has close relations with the United States and many of its citizens think highly of former U.S. President Barack Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Jakarta.\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo said after Trump's inauguration he was optimistic that relations between the countries would strengthen, to the benefit of both.\n\nForeign Minister Marsudi said Indonesians seeking visas to go the United States had not faced any problems so far.

We can be our own little island.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a stance that will be tested as California doubles down on its climate policies even as Trump steps back from the battle against global warming. And despite the bravado displayed last week at a conference on climate change hosted by state government officials, there was pervasive anxiety about the future as well.  \n \n\"I'm worried,\" said a federal scientist at the exhibit who asked to withhold his name  because he feared retaliation. Fearful that the Trump administration would strip climate information from government websites, he said he asked his team to start downloading information so they could continue their work.    \n\nCalifornia has always charted its own course on cleaning up the air, clamping down on tailpipe emissions decades ago to fight smog in Los Angeles before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was even created in 1970. But the gap between Sacramento and Washington was growing into a chasm only a week after Trump took the oath of office.  \n \nThe president is greenlighting oil pipelines that were rejected by President Obama. He told car manufacturers that regulations are \u201cout of control,\u201d and Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, his nominee to lead the EPA, expressed doubts about the severity of climate change during his confirmation hearing. \n\nMeanwhile, California is moving to dramatically slash its greenhouse gas emissions, and Senate leader Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) recently floated the possibility of generating all of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind. Major utilities have proposed a $1-billion investment  in electrifying the transportation network, including more charging stations for cars. \n\nIt\u2019s created a sense of dissonance for Californians, who are hunkering down even as they keep a wary eye on what\u2019s happening on the opposite side of the country. \n\n\u201cYou turn on the TV at night, and you hear these terrible things that are happening,\u201d said Kip Lipper, who works on environmental legislation for the state Senate. \u201cI tell my daughter, it\u2019s good to be cognizant of that, but this is the best place to be, in California.\u201d \n \nCalifornia emits only 1% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, but the state has tried to transform itself into an international model for fighting global warming. While Trump talks about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, officials here continue seeking new partners for the state\u2019s own, more ambitious international agreement . \n\nGov. Jerry Brown , in his State of the State speech Tuesday, said California wouldn\u2019t step back from its agenda no matter what happens in Washington, a message repeatedly emphasized by top state leaders at the climate conference. \n\n\u201cThis is when you do your best work,\u201d said John Laird, secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about pulling back just to sink with everyone else who isn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d \n\nThe conference was planned before Trump won the presidency, but the results of the election created a charged atmosphere among the hundreds of scientists, government officials and advocates who showed up. Attendees talked about being  \u201cresolute in our values,\u201d or how there\u2019s a \u201cmajor threat before us,\u201d or how strong policies are needed \u201cnow more than ever.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater seriousness in the room,\u201d said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of Climate Resolve, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helped organize the two-day event. \n\nCalifornia\u2019s climate agenda remains controversial, and some business interests believe the state is putting itself at a competitive disadvantage by ramping up regulations. The state\u2019s premiere initiative \u2014 the cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to purchase permits to release greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere \u2014 is the target of an ongoing legal challenge . \n\nBut the week\u2019s events were also a reminder of how much further the state has moved past the national conversation about climate change. Debates revolve around how global warming should be addressed, not whether it should be, or whether it\u2019s even real at all.  \n \nThree consecutive state administrations have pushed the state\u2019s policies forward. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, approved the country\u2019s first rules for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed legislation setting an overall goal  for reducing emissions in the state. Last year Brown enacted another law setting a new, stiffer target. \n\nA broad network of organizations \u2014 environmentalists, energy entrepreneurs and developers of carbon offset projects \u2014 has sprouted and expanded around these policies. \n \nAs further evidence, the conference hosted by state officials wasn\u2019t even the only event in Sacramento last week dedicated to California\u2019s climate agenda. Another gathering across town drew visitors from as far away as Australia to discuss the future of the cap-and-trade program.  \n\nNo one there expected the state to change course.  \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole ecosystem built to reduce emissions,\u201d said Jon Costantino, an environmental policy advisor who previously worked at the California Air Resources Board. \u201cThere\u2019s investors, there\u2019s businesses, there\u2019s consultants.\u201d \n\nHe added, \u201cTo pull the rug out from under that would have a dramatic impact.\u201d \n   \nchris.megerian@latimes.com \n\nTwitter: @chrismegerian \n\nALSO \n\nFearing climate change databases may be threatened in Trump era, UCLA scientists work to protect them \n\nEarth sets heat record in 2016 \u2014 for the third year in a row \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Megerian"},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"As the White House changes course on climate change, California stubbornly presses forward","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Maricopa","zipCode":"85301","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glendale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Glendale News Press","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169773059","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Glendale News Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.glendalenewspress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-trump-administration-orders-media-1485281190-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-pipelines-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-epa-pick-scott-pruitt-renews-climate-1484758778-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-1484938433-htmlstory.html#nt=outfit","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-renewable-1484864454-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-electric-vehicles-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-climate-20161127-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-sac-climate-brown-agreement-20151206-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/jerry-brown-PEPLT007547-topic.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-jerry-brown-state-of-the-state-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-climate-court-hearing-20170124-story.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/23/local/me-global23","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-arnold-schwarzenegger-jerry-brown-1475704818-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-jerry-brown-signs-climate-laws-20160908-snap-story.html","https://twitter.com/ChrisMegerian","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-climate-change-data-20170121-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hottest-year-2016-20170118-story.html","http://latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695202551752","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d361f/turbine/la-pol-ca-california-climate-resolve-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

The new service is a low moisture method of cleaning carpets that leaves them clean and quick drying.\n\nJoplin, United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \n\nCrystal Clean Carpets, based in Joplin, have launched a new low moisture carpet cleaning service. This new service does not soak the carpets leaving them dry within the hour saving customers valuable time.\n\nFor more information please visit: http://carpetcleaningjoplin.net.\n\nCrystal Clean Carpets is owner operated and the owner, Alan Snider, will personally answer phone calls to ensure customer satisfaction. The website explains that they are the premier low moisture and upholstery cleaners for Joplin, Carthage, and the surrounding area in South West Missouri.\n\nModern carpets can hold up to a pound of dirt per square foot and this dirt consists of dust, allergens, pollen and other impurities. The site states that not only does cleaning carpets restore them to looking their best, it also helps to keep the home healthy and hygienic.\n\nCrystal Clean Carpets help homeowners to achieve carpet cleanliness by using a low moisture cleaning system rather than the traditional hot water extraction method. The hot water extraction method involves thoroughly soaking the carpet leaving it wet for hours, as well as trailing hoses through the home. With this method stains and spots often re-appear.\n\nThe low moisture method `uses patented technology to aggressively agitate the carpet without damaging the fibers meaning that less water is needed leaving carpets dry within an hour. Another benefit of using less water is that carpets are not soaked through and that means that stains do not wick back and re-appear. They use a machine that is self contained and does not trail hoses through customers houses bringing disruption to a minimum.\n\nCrystal Clean Carpets do not use soap and modern low moisture cleaning chemicals are 96% biodegradable, making it an earth friendly option.

It explains that liposuction and liposculpture can be used to help hone patients bodies to the image they want.\n\nBrooklyn, United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \n\nA Long Island liposuction, cosmetic, skin and laser surgery center has launched a new report on the benefits of liposuction and liposculpture as a way to gently reshape the body. Doctor Rokhsar, who runs the surgery, is at the forefront of research and teaching and lectures regularly on cosmetic procedures. His latest report focuses on how the service can be a way to remove unwanted fat stores safely and gently.\n\nMore information can be found at: http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction.\n\nThe site explains that, unlike many practices, the Long Island cosmetic surgery is not a one pony show. It boasts over 40 lasers and energy based devices in its world class centers in both Manhattan and Long Island.\n\nWhile some centers will seek to sell their services, patients at the New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center will never get a sales pitch. The center will give them a realistic expectation about the outcome of procedures they are contemplating, and from there they can make the best decision for themselves.\n\nDr Rokhsar is certified in dermatology and has completed additional training in cosmetic surgery fellowship. He explains that anyone considering liposuction in the New York area should be sure to ask their doctor if they are board certified in dermatology or plastic surgery. This is because a medical degree doesn\u2019t qualify doctors to practice in the field of lasers and cosmetic surgery.\n\nThe new report explains that liposculpture and liposuction remove excess fat from the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, waistline, arms, knees, ankles, calves, cheeks, jowls and neck. Liposculpture offers more precise sculpting through using smaller instruments for the process.\n\nThis works because it relies on tumescent fluid to numb the fat as well as to help liquefy it, allowing the doctor to remove it through small cannulas. It allows for fine sculpting of the body so local patients can better get the shape they desire.\n\nFull details of the Long Island liposuction services available at New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center can be found by visiting the URL above.\n\nContact Info:\n\nName: Chris Hayes\n\nOrganization: Virtual Heroics\n\nAddress: 2440 East 29th Street, Brooklyn, 11235 United States\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.virtualheroics.com\n\nSource: PressCable\n\nRelease ID: 1652","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"New York metro area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Pacific Islands news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Long Island Liposculpture New York Cosmetic Surgery Melt Fat Report Launched","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Micronesia","countryCode":"GU","country":"Guam"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kuam News 8","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"170519371","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Kuam News 8","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kuam.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction","http://www.virtualheroics.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202554453","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Gen. Xavier Becerra in his new job, it was an unheralded duty that Republican legislators wanted to pin him down on during recent confirmation hearings in Sacramento: the vetting of ballot initiatives. \n\nThe attorney general is tasked under California law to write a brief title and summary of each measure that will end up on the state ballot. \n \n\u201cWhat will you do to ensure that you\u2019re being descriptive and objective, and following the election code, when you write those ballot titles and summaries?\u201d asked Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham (R-Templeton). \n \nTo understand the question requires knowing a bit of California political history. Attorneys general have long had the duty to collect and then prepare proposed initiatives before the measure\u2019s backers can begin collecting voter signatures. \n \nBut in the era of big money initiative campaigns \u2014 generally viewed as the years following the landmark 1978 property tax rollback, Proposition 13 \u2014 critics have occasionally complained of partisan scheming, alleging that the title and summary of an initiative are sometimes crafted in a way that pleases the attorney general\u2019s political allies. \n\nPolitical Road Map: Californians have a love-hate relationship with initiatives » \n\nOpponents of Proposition 13 complained that former Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, a Republican, wrote a summary that didn\u2019t reveal the law made it harder to pass tax increases in the Legislature. Gov. Jerry Brown, in his time as attorney general, took fire over the ballot summary for the 2008 ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8 , and its emphasis on how the (now defunct) law would \u201celiminate\u201d the right of same-sex couples to marry . \n\nAdvocates of overhauling California\u2019s public employee pension system have balked more than once over initiative titles and summaries written by Democrats serving as attorney general. In 2005, a proposed reform was summarized as removing death and disability benefits. The most recent attorney general, now Sen. Kamala Harris, also came under fire for her summaries of efforts to change pension benefits for government workers . \n\nThe evidence is largely circumstantial. And judges have generally given pretty wide latitude to the attorney general, who\u2019s simply instructed in state election law to summarize \u201cthe chief purpose and points\u201d of an initiative. \n\nBut it\u2019s also a potential game changer. Strategists and pollsters often believe an initiative\u2019s title and summary is a prescient predictor of the campaign ahead. And some California voters make snap decisions on ballot measures based on those easily accessible nuggets of information. \n\nGiven that Democrats have held the office of attorney general for 18 years, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the loudest calls for change come from Republicans. But those efforts have been routinely rebuffed. \n\nIn 2015, legislation to impose new rules on the attorney general was quietly killed in the Assembly\u2019s appropriations committee. Earlier this month, newly elected Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-El Dorado Hills) decided to go one step further. His proposal would change the state\u2019s constitution and transfer the responsibility for initiative titles and summaries to the independent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, which currently writes a fiscal analysis of each measure. \n\nAs for Becerra, the Los Angeles Democrat told lawmakers in confirmation hearings this month that he believes in fairness when it comes to summarizing initiatives. \n\n\u201cI know many of you will be reading over my shoulders,\u201d he told assemblymembers on Jan. 10. \u201cAnd I understand the importance of a word.\u201d \n   \njohn.myers@latimes.com \n\nFollow  @johnmyers  on Twitter, sign up for our daily  Essential Politics newsletter  and listen to the weekly  California Politics Podcast \n\nALSO: \n\nCalifornia initiative campaigns rake in a record $473 million in 2016 \n\nPolitical Road Map: How unlimited cash gets funneled into legislative campaigns \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Myers"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Political Road Map: Some believe there's bias baked into the official descriptions of California initiatives","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Maricopa","zipCode":"85301","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glendale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Glendale News Press","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169773059","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Glendale News Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.glendalenewspress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-xavier-becerra-california-attorney-general-snap-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-road-map-propositions-20161113-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/family/same-sex-marriage/proposition-8-%28california-2010%29-EVHST0000250-topic.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/29/local/me-gaymarriage29","http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/07/news/la-ol-fighting-words-public-employee-pension-reform-20140107","http://www.twitter.com/johnmyers","http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-newsletter-essential-politics-signup-page-htmlstory.html","https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/california-politics-podcast/id1067429614?mt=2","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-november-proposition-money-20161107-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-roadmap-unlimited-money-legislature-elections-20161023-snap-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695202554743","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d2768/turbine/la-pol-ca-road-map-initiatives-title-summary-power-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

Two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport and their ability to take passport photos\n\nNew York , United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \n\nItsEasy.com, a leading provider of passport and visa expediting services founded by visionary David Alwadish in 1976, is revolutionizing the passport and visa expediting industry with their passport renewal app.\n\nWith the 10-year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative passed in 2007, requiring Americans to have a passport for air travel to and from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, the U.S. State Department expects to have approximately 16 million passport renewals in 2016 and 20 million in 2017 \u2013 an unprecedented amount. With the ItsEasy app, U.S. passport holders will have the power and convenience of facilitating their passport renewal process at their fingertips at any location \u2013 at home, at work, anywhere \u2013 with their iPhone/IPad and Android.\n\n\u201cThis is truly an exciting time for ItsEasy. We\u2019ve been working on this app for quite some time; perfecting it, adding new components to it and bettering it in general. I wanted to create an app that allowed U.S. passport holders to renew their passport with ease from their iPhone in a beneficial, secure, and easy way,\u201d said David Alwadish, CEO and President of ItsEasy.com. \u201cThis is truly an app that all passport holders should have downloaded for free on their iPhones, and Androids. The app is more than a passport renewal app and includes other features such as passport photos, visa requirements, an emergency info button (for travelers who lose their passport or visa while in another country), and a passport renewal reminder feature that will remind users via email to renew their passport nine months before their passport expires.\u201d\n\nThe free for download ItsEasy Passport Renewal App is safe, secure, confidential, user friendly, and is based upon the company\u2019s exceptional 40-year reputation. The two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport, and their ability to take passport photos which are then reviewed and approved by qualified ItsEasy passport professionals. Travelers in need of only photos have the option to have their passport photos printed by ItsEasy and delivered by first class or overnight mail, or have them emailed electronically to be printed by the user.\n\nWhen using the app, prior to the applicant\u2019s passport renewal order being completed, and in addition to the Department of State\u2019s passport fee, ItsEasy charges an honest fee of $29.95 for their services. Considering the value, the price is well worth the investment. The passport photo feature alone saves $10-$15 as well as the savings in time, travel and wait at the post office or drugstore for passport photos. Additionally, the app features trackable priority United States Postal Service shipping label a cost savings of approximately $6.45 and 24/7 customer support plus the peace of mind of knowing you used the correct forms and order status updates. Users are provided with the choice of two renewal processing time frames \u2013 standard approximately (6 to 8 week) and expedited (2 to 3 weeks.)\n\nOnce the order is completed through the app, ItsEasy will instantly email the customer the correct passport application to be printed and completed, a simple checklist and a secure trackable USPS priority shipping label to send the documents into ItsEasy for reviewing and processing. The professionals at ItsEasy will then deliver all necessary documents to the U.S. Department of State, who issues all passports and passport cards.\n\nAlwadish added, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want an app that saves you precious time and money? Between buying the envelope, postage, passport photos and running around for the errand, if the value of the users\u2019 time saved is factored in then the savings would grow exponentially! We are providing you with peace of mind with government approved and regulated experts handling the entire process\u2014including pre-checking of documents, printing the photos, writing the check and gathering what you\u2019d have to go buy yourself \u2013 you\u2019re in safe hands and we can advise you every step of the way. I can confidently say that you\u2019ll be aware of where your application is at all times.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the 10-year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative approaching, creating the passport renewal surge, the U.S. Department of State also recently announced the elimination of visa page inserts for U.S. passports beginning this year. Previously, U.S. passport holders had the option to pay for the insertion of additional 24-page visa inserts when valid passports lacked adequate space for entry or exit visa stamps. However, now applicants in need of additional pages in their passports will have to obtain a renewal \u2013 making this app even more relevant for U.S. travelers.\n\nFor more information on ItsEasy, the new app and other services, visit the website at https://www.itseasy.com/ or call 1-866-ITS-EASY.

Germany's motor industry watchdog raised suspicions Volkswagen was using prototype vehicles to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in tests in 2015 soon after VW's manipulation of diesel emissions tests was uncovered, the Berliner Zeitung newspaper reported on Saturday.\n\nIt quoted the Federal Motor Transport Authority as telling VW in a November 2015 email it would choose test models randomly and appoint new external experts to carry out testing because of doubts about the independence of the company's CO2 testing regime.\n\n\"VW has to give a declaration that they (vehicles submitted to tests) comply with standards for serial production models and were not subject to change in any way,\" the newspaper quoted the KBA's email as saying.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from a VW spokesman. The German Transport Ministry, which is home to the KBA, declined to comment as its investigation into CO2 emission tests is not concluded yet, a spokesman said.\n\nIt was not clear in Saturday's report whether the KBA remains concerned about the transparency of VW's CO2 emissions tests.\n\nVW admitted in November 2015 that besides rigging diesel emissions tests it had understated the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of about 800,000 vehicles. It then announced a month later that follow-up tests had shown the CO2 irregularities affected less than 40,000 cars.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"German\u200e watchdog suspected VW scam on CO2 emissions: report","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Eye Witness News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"185388837","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"21885"},"name":"Eye Witness News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ewn.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202556691","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,q_70,w_700/mslt2wys7rdpe1o0aeya"}],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Merced","zipCode":"95340","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Merced","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merced Sun-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Merced Sun-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercedsunstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202556904","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was a relationship that would lead to a long and lasting marriage \u2014 and a dedication to the Finnish sliding festival in Palo now in its 80th year. \n   \nJohn Kangas died in 2009, but Gerry Kangas has carried on the tradition of the festival to be celebrated Feb. 3, 4 and 5 on the shore of Loon Lake, rural Aurora. And she will again be in charge at the museum \u2014 wearing the rhinestone snowflake pin given to her when she attended the St. Paul Winter Carnival as a guest of honor in 1954 as the reigning Miss Laskiainen. She appeared with numerous queens from throughout the country, she said, showing a scrapbook she has kept all these years. \n   \n\"It's been fun. I've been looking for artifacts most of my life,\" she said in an interview. She and her late husband operated Salmi Homes for the elderly for several years \u2014 she was just 18, and learned a storehouse of history from the Finnish immigrants who had settled in the area. \"That's where I learned about Laskiainen. I was president of the Palo-Markham Teen Club (with teacher Virginia Thompson in charge). The fund-raiser for the club was the Laskiainen dance.\" And then she was a Laskiainen Princess of the Snows in 1951 and queen in 1953. \"I have been involved with Laskiainen from 1951 to 2009 with my husband John. I keep up the Loon Lake Museum for more years than I can remember,\" she said. \n   \nWhen she was involved with the Iron Range Historical Society as treasurer, she met Dr. Thomas Vennum, who was with the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., and he became interested in learning about Laskiainen. The result was that Laskiainen was featured in the nation's capital in 1980 \u2014 including a replica of the famous Laskiainen vippu kelkka, or whip sled, set on a plywood track at the base of the Washington Monument to give rides to 2,000 school children. \"What an honor!\" Kangas said. \n   \nShe said that \"studies have concluded that our festival has survived because while holding on to our Finnish folk ways, we move on with the times.\" \n   \nShe gives a great deal of credit to the involvement of Carol Skinner and Vivian Williams. \"Our committee also consists of young people who do a fabulous job. They have definitely risen the bar. Our slides have had such a dedicated crew even in the coldest weather. The queen coronation continues to draw very special young women,\" she said. \n   \n\"I am amazed and thrilled to be part of this very old tradition brought here by the immigrant pioneers\" from Finland, which observes its centennial this year. \n   \nKangas enjoys the work in the museum. She likes to tell stories, such as about the history of the sugar lump popular with Finnish people \u2014 and how it had medicinal purposes that could cure sores. \"You get this passion (for Laskiainen) and then you have to pass it on,\" Kangas said. \"You give the young people a little taste of the tradition and they run with it.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Linda Tyssen"},"topics":[{"name":"Finland news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Laskiainen: Former queen Kangas carries on tradition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Louis","zipCode":"55792","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Virginia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Mesabi Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169752126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"72"},"name":"Mesabi Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.virginiamn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202558489","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/virginiamn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/2a/62ac767c-e5b7-11e6-94c1-6fb8477d13a2/588d333e1e3e0.image.jpg?resize=300%2C309"}],"video":[]}}

Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half.\n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points.\n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers.\n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left.\n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52.\n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stanislaus","zipCode":"95350","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Modesto","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Modesto Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657476","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"584"},"name":"Modesto Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.modbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202559054","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.modbee.com/static/images/modbee/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine.\n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane.\n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up.

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\" asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n\n\"Are they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\"\n\nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power.\n\nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country.\n\nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire.\n\nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony's independence 40 years ago\n\n- 'Won't give up on truce' -\n\nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too.\n\n\"The armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\" he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched.\n\n\"Either Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\" he said.\n\nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.\n\nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe.\n\nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations.\n\nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country.\n\n\"I must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\" said Dhlakama.\n\nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement.\n\n\"We are not going to give up on the truce.

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage.\n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek.\n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event.\n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second.\n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go.\n\n---\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.\n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event.\n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan.\n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line.\n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\"\n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan.\n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class.\n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins.\n\n---\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career.\n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing.\n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead.\n\nSo why is he giving up racing?\n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time.\n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\"\n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory.\n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium.\n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\"\n\n---\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide.\n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires.\n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters.\n\n---\n\n7:15 p.m.\n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.\n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3.\n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint.\n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\"\n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield.\n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote.\n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule.\n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized.\n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\"\n\n--\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal.\n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away.\n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\"\n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry.\n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\"\n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart.\n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\"\n\n---\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus.\n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch.\n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday.\n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\"\n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team.\n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said.\n\n---\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon.\n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else.\n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007.\n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year.\n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down.\n\n---\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag.\n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday.\n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac.\n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field.\n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stanislaus","zipCode":"95350","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Modesto","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Modesto Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657476","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"584"},"name":"Modesto Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.modbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202560783","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/wire_photos/zeov24/picture129360074/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMSA_Daytona_Rolex_Auto_Racing_47723.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

And it has during its 47 years, though for a long time almost all were men. \n \nNow, nearly three-quarters of CalArts\u2019 more than 250 animation students are women, and there\u2019s a new goal: ensure that when they land jobs, they get to draw female characters reflective of the real world and not just the nerds, sex bombs, tomboys or ugly villains who proliferate now. \n \n\u201cMale villains, for example, can be any shape or size. But female villains are usually in their menopausal or postmenopausal phases. \n \nThey\u2019re older, they\u2019re single, they\u2019re angry,\u201d said Erica Larsen-Dockray, who teaches a class on \u201cThe Animated Woman\u201d for CalArts\u2019 experimental animation program. \n \n\u201cThen you have the innocent princess,\u201d she added with a chuckle, \u201cwhose waist is so small that if she was actually alive, she wouldn\u2019t be able to walk.\u201d \n \nTo call attention to that cartoonish reality, CalArts has played host the past two years to \u201cThe Animated Woman Symposium on Gender Bias.\u201d This year it focused on the roles of \u201cSidekicks, Nerd Girls, Tomboys and More.\u201d \n \nDuring a recent raucous two-hour symposium, nearly a dozen student researchers who spent months watching cartoons and reading comic books questioned why almost all female sidekicks look like nerds. Also why female heroes like Kim Possible are over-the-top beautiful. And why there are so few gay, lesbian and transgender characters. \n \n\u201cWhat are nerd-girl stereotypes? They have glasses, they\u2019re shy, they\u2019re awkward, they have some freckles going on,\u201d said film-video student and artist Madison Stubbs as she flashed drawings of several, including two of the most popular: Velma from \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d and Meg Griffin of \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d \n \n\u201cAnd we have Tootie from \u2018Fairly OddParents,\u2019\u201d Stubbs said of the long-running Nickelodeon cartoon show\u2019s pig-tailed, braces-wearing, bespectacled sidekick. \u201cBasically, she\u2019s just in the show to go, \u2018Oh, Timmy. I want you. Why do you ignore me?\u2019\u201d \n \nNot that all female cartoon sidekicks are unattractive. \n \nVelma could be the \u201chot girl,\u201d Stubbs said, if only she would lose those nerdy glasses. But every time she does, she trips over stuff, walks into things and nearly upends another paranormal investigation by those meddling kids from Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated. \n \nKim Possible, who couples her intellect with martial-arts skills to scuttle nefarious Dr. Drakken\u2019s plans to take over the world, has her own problems. Unable to attract any handsome, smart guy, she ultimately settles for her nerdy male sidekick, Ron Stoppable. \n \nThere\u2019s a reason for such drawings and scenarios, said Marge Dean, president of the industry group Women in Animation: Men still fill animation\u2019s writing rooms and director\u2019s chairs. \n \n\u201cMany, many, many women are going to animation schools. At CalArts, it\u2019s over 70 percent. But yet if you start looking at women in creative roles, the last number we have is only 22 percent,\u201d said Dean, whose organization tracks figures through schools and industry groups. \n \nIn an effort to boost those numbers, CalArts faculty invites studio representatives to campus for events like portfolio days and maintains a close relationship with groups like Dean\u2019s, which is pushing the studios to have a creative workforce of half women and half men by 2025. \n \nCalArts, with a student enrollment of nearly 1,500, offers graduate and undergraduate degrees in such fields as animation, art, music, film, acting, photography and others. The small school situated amid picturesque rolling hills some 30 miles north of Los Angeles has produced many of the entertainment industry\u2019s leading creative figures, including director Tim Burton and Oscar-winning animator and Disney-Pixar executive John Lasseter. \n \nOther alumni, including Brad Bird, Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter, have directed nine of the 15 Oscar-winning animated feature films since that category was created in 2002. Only two of those 15 films had female directors. Both of them, Brenda Chapman and Jennifer Lee, are CalArts graduates. \n \nDean believes the character landscape will change as the popularity of animation continues to grow. \n \nThree of last year\u2019s top 10 box office films were animated \u2014 \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets.\u201d \n \nNone were directed by women, although Lee, who wrote and co-directed the 2013 Oscar-winning film \u201cFrozen,\u201d had a writing credit on \u201cZootopia.\u201d \n \nTo make real change, students entering the animated world must demand it, said Stacey Simmons of the production company Stoopid Buddy Stoodios. \n \n\u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to change it is to keep doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe industry itself has changed a lot, but it has not changed at the same rate the country has.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Female animators drawing away from cliches","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202561201","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:49:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Here, then, are the answers: \n \nQUESTION: Some people refer to this series as \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek meets Twin Peaks.\u201d Is that accurate? \n \nANSWER : It isn\u2019t just \u201csome people\u201d who say that, it\u2019s Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa himself, a TV and comics veteran who is the Chief Creative Officer at Archie Comics and the creator of \u201cRiverdale.\u201d He told comicbookresources. com in 2014: \u201cSomething we talk a lot about is, \u2018Imagine if Riverdale were like \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d and was a really weird small town.\u2019 But \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d had some very funny black humor stuff to it; obviously it was very serious as well. So that kind of balance is what we\u2019re going to try to strike with the show.\u201d \n \nQUESTION: So it\u2019s going to be weird. \n \nANSWER : A little, yeah. It begins with the death of Jason Blossom, the identical twin of Riverdale High\u2019s Queen Bee and resident Mean Girl, Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch). Much like \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d Riverdale is going to be the \u201950s throwback town with dark secrets beneath the seemingly perfect surface. \n \nQUESTION: Why do that? Why change these wholesome characters from our youth? Is nothing sacred? \n \nANSWER : Because the wholesome characters from our youth don\u2019t sell well anymore. I read them until middle school and then quit, and I bet so did you. And younger kids today are playing video games, not reading Archies. Up until recently, the Archie titles were selling in the low thousands. \n \nSo for the last few years, Archie Comics has been working to fix these problems by placing the gang in new situations \u2014 zombie-apocalypse-survivor Archie in \u201cAfterlife with Archie,\u201d grown-and-married Archie in \u201cLife with Archie,\u201d not-long-for-this-world Archie in \u201cArchie vs. Predator.\u201d The publisher assumed affection for the characters would carry readers through, and it worked. \n \nThe core line of Archie books has been rebooted as well. The new titles still feature a group of basically good (and funny) kids, but the humor is more sophisticated and the approach more modern. They\u2019re written and drawn by mostly A-list talent, and appeal to older readers as well as their children. \n \n\u201cRiverdale\u201d is just an extension of that game plan. \n \nQUESTION: Will I recognize any actors on this show? \n \nANSWER : Oh, sure. Most of the principals are essentially newcomers, but you\u2019ll see Luke Perry of \u201cBeverly Hills 90201\u201d as Archie\u2019s dad, Fred Andrews. Molly Ringwald, who seemed to star in every movie John Hughes made in the \u201980s, plays Archie\u2019s mother, Mary Andrews. Madchen Amick, waitress Shelly Johnson at the Double R Diner in \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d is Betty\u2019s mother, Alice Cooper. Cole Sprouse, of \u201cGrace Under Fire,\u201d plays Jughead. Shannon Purser, who played Barb on \u201cStranger Things,\u201d is \u201cBig\u201d Ethel Muggs. Sarah Habel, who plays Miss Grundy, was in \u201cHostel: Part III,\u201d which makes her sorta famous, I guess. \n \nQUESTION: Wait, Sarah Habel is a hottie! Miss Grundy is supposed to be an old bat! \n \nANSWER : Not in \u201cRiverdale\u201d! And she\u2019s something of a twentysomething cougar, having seduced Archie into an illicit affair at the beginning of the show. \n \nQUESTION: Wait, there\u2019s sex in Riverdale? That\u2019s new. \n \nANSWER: We still don\u2019t see it in the comics. As to \u201cRiverdale,\u201d we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. There was sex when we were in high school, too, and always has been. We just didn\u2019t talk about it, and girls who got pregnant \u201cwent to visit their aunt\u201d for six months. Welcome to the 21st century, where what goes on behind closed doors is discussed at Pop\u2019s Choklit Shoppe. \n \nQUESTION: Speaking of sex, it looks like Betty and Veronica are kissing on one of the \u201cRiverdale\u201d trailers. I guess in the 21st century, they just don\u2019t need Archie. \n \nANSWER: Don\u2019t worry, the central love triangle is still mostly intact on \u201cRiverdale.\u201d Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart), who has been best friends with Archie (KJ Apa) since childhood, is wrestling with stronger feelings for him. That\u2019s complicated by the arrival of Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), who snags Archie\u2019s attention. \n \nBut Reinhart told holly woodlife.com that the kiss on the trailer is a dodge. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re not romantically involved,\u201d she said. And while there\u2019s a lot of fan fiction out there about \u201cBeronica,\u201d and some fans would love to see them as a couple, Reinhart says \u201cThat\u2019s not our show.\u201d The girls are the best of friends, according to The CW description, and they\u2019re unlikely to jeopardize that by fighting over a boy. \n \nQUESTION: So there\u2019s no homosexuality on the show? \n \nANSWER: I didn\u2019t say that. Kevin Keller (Casey Cott) is an openly gay student at Riverdale High, as he is in the comics. And while it\u2019s by no means definite, Entertainment Weekly describes Ethel as someone \u201cwho has a major crush on Jughead ... in the comics. But, on Riverdale, Ethel will find herself in a romantic relationship with someone very different.\u201d It\u2019s a good bet that someone is of a different gender. \n \nQUESTION: Or a different race? \n \nANSWER: That\u2019s possible, too. The original Archie cast was created in the 1940s, so by default they were all white. \u201cRiverdale,\u201d however, reflects the America of today. \n \nVeronica and her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols) are Latina. It\u2019s unclear who plays resident genius Dilton Doiley \u2014 both Daniel Yang and Major Curda have been mentioned \u2014 but he\u2019s definitely Asian. Josie & the Pussycats, which used to have one black member, is now entirely African-American (starring Ashleigh Murray as Josie, Hayley Law as Valerie and Asha Bromfield as Melody). Ross Butler, who plays Archie foil Reggie Mantle, is part Indonesian. \n \nQUESTION: Reggie, Dilton, Josie and the Pussycats \u2014 who else made the cut? \n \nANSWER: Riverdale High\u2019s coach Clayton (Colin Lawrence) appears, so maybe his son Chuck will, too. \n \nMarmaduke \u201cMoose\u201d Mason (Cody Kearsley) is on the show, but so far there\u2019s no sign of girlfriend Midge Klump. Cheryl\u2019s Mean Girl posse includes Ginger Lopez (Caitlin Mitchell-Markovitch) and Tina Patel (Olivia Ryan Stern). But probably the most interesting cast member could arrive from neighboring Greendale. \n \nQUESTION: You mean ... ? \n \nANSWER: Yep. Rumor has it that Sabrina the Teenage Witch is due to appear in the last episode of what will hopefully be just the first season of \u201cRiverdale.\u201d Anybody know what Melissa Joan Hart is doing these days?","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The 4-1-1 on Archie Comics' new series 'Riverdale'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202563513","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:54:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In reply you may ask: 'Why bring that up now?'\" \n \n\u201cOn Monday of this week,\u201d Taylor continued, \u201ca Thibodaux gentleman rang up the editor of the Comet and wanted to know who owned the first auto to be driven over the streets of Thibodaux? It was an altogether unexpected question, but we replied that, as far as we could remember, Dr. Felix Riviere was the first man here to have a car. \n \n\u201cThen we added that possibly it was Albert Trone, but we were not certain just which one was first. Since the phone conversation we are inclined to the belief that Mr. Trone was the first, he driving a one-seat, topless car on the streets here during the early part of 1909. \n \n\u201cOur questioner suggested: 'Was it not a Mr. Legendre, whose first name was Oleus?' \n \n\u201cWe replied 'no', for the man whose first name was Oleus is still roaming around waiting for Father Time to 'get him'. Then we added that the last name was 'Legendre', but the first name, we thought, was 'Joe', there having been several 'Joe Legendres' in this town, but just after the phone conversation we called to mind that the correct name was 'Frank Legendre'. \n \n\u201cHe had what his friends called a 'one lung' automobile, they calling it that way because it had but one cylinder and used to make the familiar noise of 'chug-chug', thus attracting attention wherever it went.\u201d \n \nTaylor's automotive ramble continued: \u201cOne day, along in 1910, the Legendre 'horseless carriage' was passing our home. The late T.R. Simmons was in his room across the way in a two-story building where Hotel Jeffries now stands. Mr. Simmons, who was quite friendly with the late Mr. Legendre, raised the sash of a window and yelled out to the horseless carriage: 'Take that lawn-mower off the street,' but Mr. Legendre did not do it. He went right along with the 'chug-chug' carriage. \n \n\u201cWe could mention a few other things about auto incidents of the past, but that might bore. Especially would we relate how the honest statement that 'we had no trouble at all.' \n \n\u201cYou could believe that statement as long as you did not look at the driver's hands, for very few motorists went out those days and came back with clean hands, it being necessary for all of them to 'get out and get under' to find out why in the mischief the old machine would not work. \n \n\u201cHowever they invariably tried to deceive (not exactly 'lie' about the matter), but their mistake was to have with them a 'wife', a 'sister' or a 'child', so the 'day after the day before' the wife, sister or child would tell friends, confidentially, about the 'delightful' trip and suddenly the wife, sister or child would forget and say that 'everything was fine until we had a puncture', or until the spark plugs would not work, or the battery went 'dead,' so, then the 'cat was out of the bag' and every one knew that the trip to Labadieville or Lafourche Crossing was not such a 'dream', it being learned that 'Pa' had to get out and sweat pumping up a leaky tube, or 'Ma' had to help find the tools, she not knowing a monkey wrench from a screw-driver, but 'Ma' has since learned, and she can crank a car in fine fashion, especially if the engine is a self-starter.\u201d \n \nTaylor's rambling recollection was not nearly over: \n \n\u201cBut all of these 'pleasant' or 'unpleasant' events have passed away ,and they are practically forgotten, but what we'd like to know is this: \n \n\u201cWho was the first person in Lafourche to drive a horse and buggy over the Raceland-Des Allemands-New Orleans road? We are not over-anxious to know, but the thought often flashes across our mind about the one who had the supreme pleasure. We remember recording in the Comet, about 20 years ago, about the trip being made over the road, but then we did not have the name of the person who performed such a feat. \n \n\u201cWe are practically certain that no one in Thibodaux knows, but there are some citizens around Raceland or Lockport who know. Maybe, Hon Frank Barker the member of the Police Jury from Ward 9, can tell, because he was largely instrumental in having a road built through the swamp, that years ago stood as an impenetrable barrier to any one or anything save the 'iron horse' of the S.P.R.R. (Southern Pacific Railroad). \n \n\u201cTo others it appeared a dense, watery forest, infested with reptiles, that could not be overcome. The job, however, was undertaken and pushed to completion by a progressive committee, headed by Mr. Barker; he and the Godchaux Co. Inc., the late C.S. Mathews, the Bowie Lumber Co. and the Des Allemands Land Company, represented by Mr. A.T. Dusenberry, agreeing to assume a special tax in order that the road might become a reality -- the practical and popular reality that is to-day. \n \n\u201cWe trust that the foregoing reminiscent comments, aroused by a question regarding the first automobile that dared to appear in this parish, will be read with interest.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bill Ellzey Columnist"},"topics":[],"title":"Photographs and memories: 1937 article reminisces about Thibodaux's first automobile","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Terrebonne","zipCode":"70360","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Houma Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670432","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"453"},"name":"Houma Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.houmatoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202563689","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Scenic spots around Los Angeles featured in \u201cLa La Land\u201d included the Hermosa Beach Pier. And in Pittsburgh, \u201cFences\u201d was filmed in a house that perfectly evokes playwright \u201cAugust Wilson\u2019s world,\u201d according to his widow. \n \nOther movies with connections to real places include \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d filmed in coastal towns near Boston, and \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d about African-American women who worked for NASA in Virginia, where several attractions may be of interest to fans. \n \nHere are some details. \n \n\u2018LA LA LAND\u2019 \n \nThis musical love letter to Los Angeles includes shots of many recognizable destinations around the city. Among them: Griffith Observatory, the Hermosa Beach Pier and nearby Lighthouse Cafe, the Hollywood Walk of Fame mural, Angels Flight Railway, Grand Central Market and the Smoke House restaurant. There\u2019s even a scene staged amid traffic on a freeway overpass. \n \n\u2018MOONLIGHT\u2019 \n \nMuch of this story of a young black man coming of age was set and shot in and around Miami\u2019s Liberty Square housing project. One of the most tender scenes depicts the protagonist as a child being taught to swim by a drug dealer who serves as a father figure. That scene was shot on Virginia Key beach, a black-only beach during the segregation era on the Rickenbacker Causeway that connects mainland Miami to Key Biscayne. \n \n\u201cMoonlight\u201d is structured in three parts. The final segment centers on a reunion shot in a real restaurant, Jimmy\u2019s Eastside Diner, where fans can grab breakfast or lunch. \n \n\u2018FENCES\u2019 \n \n\u201cFences,\u201d a movie adapted from the August Wilson play, was set and shot in Wilson\u2019s hometown, Pittsburgh. Many of the scenes were filmed in a small brick house at 809 Anaheim St. Wilson\u2019s widow, Constanza Romero, visited the house, escorted by the film\u2019s star and director, Denzel Washington, and told The Associated Press that she felt like she was \u201cinside August Wilson\u2019s world ... It was just such a feeling that August\u2019s words had become three-dimensional.\u201d Wilson\u2019s actual childhood home is about 2 miles away at 1727 Bedford Ave., and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \n \nFans will also want to visit the August Wilson Center, a multi-use performing arts center in Pittsburgh with a theater, art galleries and more. An exhibit with video interviews, costumes and props from the movie runs through March 10. The Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation publishes a guidebook called \u201cAugust Wilson: Pittsburgh Places in His Life and Plays\u201d and various walking tours are available of the city\u2019s historically African-American Hill District. \n \n\u2018HIDDEN FIGURES\u2019 \n \nThis movie tells the story of African-American women who worked at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., in the early 1960s. Their work helped put John Glenn into orbit. The movie was mostly filmed in Atlanta, but Hampton offers several attractions worth visiting. \n \nA new exhibit called \u201cWhen the Computer Wore a Skirt: NASA\u2019s Human Computers\u201d just opened at the Hampton History Museum. Fans can also learn more about the work done at Langley at the Virginia Air & Space Center, which is hosting a talk by Margot Lee Shetterly, author of the book \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d on March 7 at 7:30 p.m. \n \nA bench dedicated to one of the women featured in the movie, Katherine Johnson, is located directly across from the Air & Space Center in Carousel Park. \n \n\u2018MANCHESTER BY THE SEA\u2019 \n \nThe movie was filmed in parts of Cape Ann and the North Shore of Massachusetts. Gloucester served as the backdrop for a number of scenes, including the pivotal tear-jerking scene between Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck. Central Street in downtown Manchester was also in the film, and cemetery scenes were filmed in the Rosedale cemetery. Local spots like the Willow Rest on Holly Street in Gloucester and Fibber McGee\u2019s in Beverly also figure in the movie locations. \n \n\u2018HELL OR HIGH WATER\u2019 \n \nThis movie is set in West Texas but was filmed in New Mexico. Bank robbery scenes were shot in Clovis and Portales, and Quay County\u2019s Caprock Escarpment also makes an appearance along with spots in Moriarty and Tucumcari. \n \nThe Route 66 Casino Hotel in Albuquerque was among the locations. \n \n\u201820TH CENTURY WOMEN\u2019 \n \nThis movie about a mother and her teenage son set in 1979 included many locations in the Santa Barbara, Calif., area. Among them: East Beach, West Beach, Miramar Beach and Ganna Walska Lotusland garden and historic estate in Montecito. An area near Gaviota Pier at Gaviota State Park, with a scene driving through the Gaviota Tunnel on Highway 101, was also included. \n \nSkateboarding scenes were shot on Ashley Road at East Mountain Drive and San Leandro Lane near Crane School in Montecito. \n \n\u2018FANTASTIC BEASTS\u2019 \n \nThis magical romp through 1920s New York City shows many famous landmarks, including the Woolworth Building and the Statue of Liberty. But many of the places shown in the film look very different today, including Times Square, the Central Park Zoo and the Lower East Side.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Real places that inspired nominated Oscar films","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202571378","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:54:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine.\n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108.

That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Milwaukee news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98506","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Olympian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658445","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"962"},"name":"The Olympian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theolympian.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.theolympian.com/sports/nba/article129445399.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=Thomas%20shines%20again%20as%20Celtics%20hold%20off%20Bucks%20for%20112-108%20OT%20win&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129445399.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129445399.html&title=Thomas+shines+again+as+Celtics+hold+off+Bucks+for+112-108+OT+win","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129445399.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129445399.html&description=Thomas+shines+again+as+Celtics+hold+off+Bucks+for+112-108+OT+win&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.theolympian.com/sports/nba/article129445399.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202578656","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.theolympian.com/static/images/theolympian/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n \nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n \n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n US President Donald Trump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms for the era of \u201cAmerica first\u201d © AFP/File / Timothy A. CLARY  \nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n \nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n \nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n \nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n \nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n \nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n \n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n Keeping Trump\u2019s campaign promises © AFP / Gillian HANDYSIDE, Christopher HUFFAKER, Kun TIAN  \nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n \nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n \nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n \nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n \nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n \nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n \nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n US President Donald Trump shows his signature on executive orders alongside US Defense Secretary James Mattis and US Vice President Muike Pence on January 27, 2017, at the Pentagon © AFP/File / MANDEL NGAN  \nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n \nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n \nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n \nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n \nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n \n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n \n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n \n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n \nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n \nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n A federal judge\u2019s decision to block part of Trump\u2019s temporary immigration ban accompanied growing resistance with large protests at major airports across the country © AFP / Bryan R. Smith  \nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n \nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n \nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n \nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n \nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll, Trump\u2019s approval rating at the end of his first week stood at 36 percent. \n \nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n \nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n \n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n \nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n \nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"KE","country":"Kenya"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"CapitalFM Kenya","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"475101371","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"168"},"name":"CapitalFM Kenya","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202582783","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:50Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2017/01/feda8cac27547de2c2eb1a2104900d49467b3a3f.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2017/01/047657fbfb2ca4029f6bed8092388dcd213bd2ff.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2017/01/835e708554e4290a72a3f6e659016b65280671f7.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2017/01/927bf5ba3671e6326a856b91ff1eba328e6409e4.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2017/01/da3e26b541c2a54fe90337d0d09b157f727164be.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage.\n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek.\n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event.\n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second.\n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go.\n\n---\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.\n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event.\n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan.\n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line.\n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\"\n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan.\n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class.\n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins.\n\n---\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career.\n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing.\n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead.\n\nSo why is he giving up racing?\n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time.\n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\"\n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory.\n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium.\n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\"\n\n---\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide.\n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires.\n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters.\n\n---\n\n7:15 p.m.\n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.\n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3.\n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint.\n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\"\n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield.\n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote.\n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule.\n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized.\n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\"\n\n--\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal.\n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away.\n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\"\n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry.\n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\"\n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart.\n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\"\n\n---\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus.\n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch.\n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday.\n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\"\n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team.\n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said.\n\n---\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon.\n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else.\n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007.\n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year.\n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down.\n\n---\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag.\n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday.\n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac.\n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field.\n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer non-durables news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Luxury goods news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Switzerland news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98506","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Olympian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658445","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"962"},"name":"The Olympian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theolympian.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.theolympian.com/entertainment/celebrities/article129371324.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Latest%3a%20Jeff%20Gordon%2c%20Taylor%20Racing%20halfway%20home%20to%20Rolex&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fentertainment%2fcelebrities%2farticle129371324.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fentertainment%2fcelebrities%2farticle129371324.html&title=The+Latest%3a+Jeff+Gordon%2c+Taylor+Racing+halfway+home+to+Rolex","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fentertainment%2fcelebrities%2farticle129371324.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fentertainment%2fcelebrities%2farticle129371324.html&description=The+Latest%3a+Jeff+Gordon%2c+Taylor+Racing+halfway+home+to+Rolex&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mcclatchy-wires.com%","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.theolympian.com/entertainment/celebrities/article129371324.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202585291","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/wire_photos/zeov24/picture129360074/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMSA_Daytona_Rolex_Auto_Racing_47723.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Hockey League fans Saturday night at Kal Tire Place. \n \nAdamson, a former Western Leaguer, broke a scoreless tie at 2:06 of the third period on a backhander past Evan DeBrouwer from close range. \n \nNiko Karamanis completed a gorgeous passing play with Jagger Williamson and Connor Clouston five minutes later for his 16th snipe of the season. \n \nAdamson added further insurance with 5:37 to play on another bang-bang play to the left side of DeBrouwer. Ryan Brushett drew the assist on Adamson's 12th goal of the year. \n \nThings were tight checking for 40 minutes with Nanaimo forward Jamie Collins getting stoned by Viper goalie Darion Hanson on a shorthanded breakaway chance in the first period. Hanson went to 11-2. \n \nThe game's only scrap occurred late in the third period after Clipper d-man Sean Buchanan rocked Viper forward Jesse Lansdell into the end boards behind DeBrouwer. Viper monster blueliner Shane Kelly - wearing a full face shield after requiring stitches in his mouth from an errant puck two games ago - tossed his helmet and gloves aside as he raced towards Buchanan from the point. Kelly landed a few bombs and headed straight to the dressing room. \n \nArena staff took about 10 minutes to repair a hole in the Total Restoration signage which was damaged by Buchanan's check on Lansdell. \n \nThe Clippers outshot the Snakes 39-30. Vernon improved to 25-15-4-4, while Nanaimo dipped to 18-24-5-1. The Vipers moved to within eight points of the Interior Division-leading Penticton Vees, 6-3 losers to the host Trail Smoke Eaters. Nanaimo captain Spencer Hewson, a Vernon minor hockey grad, watched in civvies due to a separated shoulder. Vernon's Matt Kowalski saw spot duty on the Clippers' fourth line. \n \nVernon takes on the Prince George Spruce Kings, while Nanaimo visits the Surrey Eagles in Sunday afternoon tilts.

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Horry","zipCode":"29578","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Myrtle Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657695","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1140"},"name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202596970","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

SIGN THE PETITION. Click here. \n \nWASHINGTON, D.C., January 24, 2017 ( LifeSiteNews ) \u2013 The U.S. House of Representatives voted 238 to 183 today to permanently ban taxpayer funding of abortion. \n \nThe No Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act (HR 7), introduced by Rep. Chris Smith, R-NJ, makes permanent the so-called Hyde Amendment permanent. Thus far the amendment, which prohibits federal money from being used to fund abortions through Medicaid, has been subject to annual renewal.  \n \nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute estimates the Hyde Amendment has saved over two million lives since it was enacted in 1976. \n \nA January 2017 Marist poll revealed 61% of Americans don\u2019t support using tax dollars to pay for abortions. \n \nThe No Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act also removes abortion funding from Obamacare while legislators consider replacements for Obama's signature healthcare law. \n \nThank President Trump for defunding International Planned Parenthood. SIGN THE PETITION. Click here. \n \nAccording to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) , 1,036 of Obamacare plans sold in 2014 included abortion on demand. Other Obamacare plans lack transparency on their abortion funding. \n \nSome Democrats took to the House floor to say that Obamacare doesn't fund abortions, which Smith rebutted with GAO statistics. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-MI, complained that HR 7 is \"about going well beyond\" the Hyde Amendment. Others defended Planned Parenthood and touted that they had participated in the Women's March on Washington in their speeches against the bill. \n \nPro-life members of Congress pointed out that the legislation simply makes permanent what is already renewed annually by Congress, and that it allows for transparency on abortion coverage in healthcare plans. \n \nRep. Liz Cheney, R-WY, blasted those using the \"women's march\" as a way to imply they speak for all women, noting that pro-life feminists were excluded from it. She plugged Friday's 44th annual March for Life. Rep. Diane Black, R-TN, also noted the hypocrisy of the women's march excluding pro-life women. \n \nRep. Virginia Foxx, R-NC, called HR7 a \"common-sense measure.\" Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-MO, said she was \"heartsick\" to hear her colleagues celebrating the recent anniversary of  Roe v. Wade  and called them out for labeling abortion \"care\" instead of \"taking life.\" \n \nRELATED:  Trump promises to sign new ban on taxpayer-funded abortions \n \nRELATED:  Trump White House promises \u2018heavy Administration presence\u2019 at March for Life \n \nThe White House released a statement saying, \"the Administration strongly supports H.R. 7...if the President were presented with H.R. 7 in its present form, he would sign the bill.\" \n  \nIf @HouseDemocrats won't vote for modest #HR7 bill, there is not a single limit on abortion they will accept.

Martha Roby, R-AL.  \n \nRep. Trent Franks, R-AZ, said that the \"real question before us\" is \"does abortion kill a little baby?\" If so, he said, then abortion is the \"greatest human genocide\" in history. \n  \n2 million Americans are alive today because Hyde Amendment saves lives.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ada","zipCode":"83707","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Boise","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho Statesman","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2631"},"name":"Idaho Statesman","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatesman.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202602492","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ada","zipCode":"83707","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Boise","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho Statesman","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2631"},"name":"Idaho Statesman","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatesman.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202602674","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season.

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bibb","zipCode":"31201","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Macon","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macon Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659292","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"56"},"name":"Macon Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macon.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202605640","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They play Adelaide twice and the three teams immediately above them once. \n \nIn the weekend's only other game, Dandenong (14-6) defeated Melbourne 78-66 to initially keep top spot, a position they held until Sunday's loss.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sydney news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Narrow wins, but big WNBL prize for Sydney","source":{"category":"Government","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Northern Territory Government","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"470578777","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"168"},"name":"Northern Territory Government","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sbs.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202608582","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"1070wapi.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"471767521","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"1070wapi.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.1070wapi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695202611803","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent. \n\n\"My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society's strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out... Smile more to score more,\" he said. \n\nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in 'kumbh' fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \"This is the strength of celebration.\" \n\nDuring examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure. \n\nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \"a question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\". \n\nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge. \n\n\"Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and marksheetd have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\" Modi said. \n\nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam's failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. \n\nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. \n\n\"To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one's time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again -- do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\" he said.  \n \nTurning his focus to parents, Modi said they should accept their children as they are and not burden them with expectations. \n\n\"There is a lot of discussion about the weight of students' school bag. It seem that the weight of parents' expectations is more. Expectation is at the root of problems while acceptance gives you an opportunity to improve things and look for new ways,\" he said, asking them to spend quality time with their children. \n\nUnderlining the need to avoid competing with others, he said it leads to jealousy, disappointment and complacency while if one competes with oneself it leads to stronger resolve, introspection and inspiration. \n\nHighlighting the need to play sports even as they prepare for exams, he said, \"Letter 'P' is for preparation and 'P' is also for play. The person who plays shines. Proper rest, adequate sleep and physical exercise should be there... \n\n\"A happy mind is the secret for a good marksheet. When you are tense, knowledge takes a back seat.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"1070wapi.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"471767521","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"1070wapi.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.1070wapi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695202621276","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n\nJudge sets up roadblock \n\nWhile Trump\u2019s executive order was effective immediately, a federal judge threw a spanner in his works on Saturday with an emergency ruling. \n\nJudge Ann Donnelly announced she was granting a stay that would prevent the government from deporting immigrants currently detained in airports around the US. \n\nDeporting refugees and visa-holders would cause \u201csubstantial and irreparable injury\u201d, the judge said. \n\nRead: \n\nHowever the ruling only protects those who had already arrived in the US, not those heading to the States in the imminent future while Trump\u2019s order still stands. \n\n\u201cRealistically, we don\u2019t even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes,\u201d American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt told AP. \u201cThis order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach US soil.\u201d \n\nAn estimated 170 people were denied entry to the US after the order was signed, Reuters reported, leading to mass protests outside US airports. \n\nThis is how people across #America are responding to #Trump\u2018s immigration ban\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Ni70O36PX4 \n\n\u2014 Sara Firth (@Sara__Firth) January 29, 2017 \n\nTrump to chat to UAE royal \n\nThe US President will hold a phone call with HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, later today, the White House said in a brief statement. \n\nTrump will also talk with Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman and acting president of South Korea, Hwang Kyo-Ahn, amid the furore \u2013 though the discussions are not believed to be solely focused around his visa ban. \n\nWhile the UAE isn\u2019t one of the countries targeted by the ban, many living here could likely be affected \u2013 up to 1.1 million, in fact. \n\nIt\u2019s estimated that around 240,000 Syrians and 500,000 Iranians live in the UAE, What\u2019s On reports, along with tens of thousands of Somalis, Sudanese, Iraqis, and Yemenis. \n\nRead: \n\nAnd even UAE nationals heading to the US may face hefty delays, with Trump revealing heavy vetting will be in place at airports. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have extreme vetting in all cases.

Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program.\n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:30 a.m.\n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots.\n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage.\n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek.\n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event.\n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second.\n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.\n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event.\n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan.\n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line.\n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\"\n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan.\n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class.\n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career.\n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing.\n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead.\n\nSo why is he giving up racing?\n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time.\n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\"\n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory.\n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium.\n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide.\n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires.\n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n7:15 p.m.\n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.\n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3.\n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint.\n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\"\n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield.\n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote.\n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule.\n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized.\n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal.\n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away.\n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\"\n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry.\n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\"\n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart.\n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus.\n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch.\n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday.\n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\"\n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team.\n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon.\n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else.\n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007.\n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year.\n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag.\n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday.\n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \"\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field.\n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP auto racing: www.racing.ap.org","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing Halfway Home to Rolex","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"ABC News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587548","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ABC News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abcnews.com","publisher":"Walt Disney Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://abcnews.go.com/topics/sports/racing/jeff-gordon.htm","http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm","http://racing.ap.org/article/jeff-gordon-getting-black-and-blue-chasing-shiny-rolex-watch","http://abcnews.go.com/topics/entertainment/tv/dancing-with-the-stars.htm","http://www.racing.ap.org/"],"sequenceId":"695202630214","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:49Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_4x3t_384.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

With this guide, there is no longer any excuse. \n   \nNew York, NY (PRWEB)  January 29, 2017 \n \nLegal Technology Professionals Institute (LTPI) releases its latest resource, the Meet and Confer Instructional Guide today, for public comment and feedback. \n \nThe Meet and Confer Instructional Guide has been developed to assist legal practitioners in navigating the \u201cMeet and Confer\u201d process. The document covers the technical issues involved in a meet and confer, with an emphasis on being prepared with a solid IG framework and numerous considerations around proportionality. \n \n\u201cThis guide represents years of hard-won practical experience and contains advice around implementing the latest changes to the FRCP,\u201d explains LTPI Board Member Quin Gregor. \u201cIn developing this, while we found a few frameworks, these were either too high level or too in the weeds. None of these laid our vision of how we thought the process should be addressed. With our focus on legal technology and its application our advice is naturally more on the practical than legal. However, we have represented the legal framework as much as we need to within the LTPI purview. We've all witnessed too many drive-by Meet & Confers when one sides ignorance of the process led to shoddy client representation. With this guide, there is no longer any excuse.\u201d \n \nThe guide is broken into 4 stages: pre-conference, activities at the conference, post conference, and \u201ccommon pitfalls\u201d, providing practical guidance and checklist items and related strategic considerations to streamline the process and avoid any missed steps. It is a valuable resource to both the novice and the expert. \n \nThe project team members include Bob Rohlf (Exterro), Peter Pepiton (Dinsmore), Chris Paskach (The Claro Group), P. Sean d\u2019Albertis (Faegre), Kevin Clark (Thompson & Knight), Martin Tully (Akerman), Seth Eichenholtz (Mastercard), Quin Gregor (SigINT), Sunil Ohri (Stein Mitchell), and Noah Lauricella (Goldenberg Law). \n \nLTPI with industry partner ACEDS will host a webinar to discuss the guide and share best practices regarding the technical issues involved in a meet and confer. The webinar entitled \u201cMastering a Meaningful Meet-and-Confer\u201d will take place on February 23, 2017 at 1:00 PM EDT. More information about the webinar including how to register can be here . \n \nThe guide is currently open for public comment for the next 30 days by the legal community before being finalized and released. \nTo learn more about the Meet and Confer Guide, visit https://www.legaltechpi.org/Meet-and-Confer . \n \nLTPI is open to suggestions for new projects and accepting new project members. Requests for new projects can be submitted at https://legaltechpi.org/Projects-New-Project-Proposal or sent to programs(at)legaltechpi.org. \n \nAbout LTPI \nLegal Technology Professional Institute ( http://www.legaltechpi.org ) is a nonprofit legal association for legal practitioners who are involved in the use of technology utilized by the legal industry, including eDiscovery in litigation and investigations, and information governance. Sponsors of the initiative include the world\u2019s leading law firms, corporations, enterprise software companies, and litigation support providers. \n  \nShare article on social media or email","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"LTPI Releases Meet and Confer Instructional Guide","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"PRWeb","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661338","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5536"},"name":"PRWeb","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prweb.com","publisher":"PR Newswire"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVnYWx0ZWNocGkub3JnLw==","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hY2Vkcy5vcmcv","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hY2Vkcy5vcmcvZXZlbnQvbWVhbmluZ2Z1bG1lZXRhbmRjb25mZXI=","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVnYWx0ZWNocGkub3JnL01lZXQtYW5kLUNvbmZlcg==","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWdhbHRlY2hwaS5vcmcvUHJvamVjdHMtTmV3LVByb2plY3QtUHJvcG9zYWw=","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWdhbHRlY2hwaS5vcmc=","https://www.legaltechpi.org/Meet-and-Confer","https://legaltechpi.org/Projects-New-Project-Proposal","http://www.legaltechpi.org/"],"sequenceId":"695202634241","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It guides the reader to get to the root of blockages like excess poundage, release the cause of what was keeping her stuck, to get to that new job, new outfit, new healthy relationship or new health regime. Her book is readily available on Kindle, Amazon, CreateSpace and http://www.padaran.com for easy reading under the category of self-help, personal transformation, and self-help, motivational. Her book\u2019s official launch date is February 11, 2017. \n \nDaya was in a near death car accident and could no longer continue her work as a Yoga instructor or prepare her own food for the family. She had to rely on what the three males in the house could prepare for her, which were often fast foods. While no Yoga or exercise was possible for a very long time, she chose to exercise in her mind using tools she had learned previously in her study of yoga and fitness. This reinforced her understanding of the power of thought, particularly strong before, during and after sleeping, in transforming our reality. \n \nThere is an inherited gift of Creative Mind that is available to each of us. Our Maker is always in Total Agreement with whatever thoughts are held and entertained as truth. Consider these points from Daya's book. \n\n The power and knowledge to work with thoughts and utilize them to transform reality is always available. Consciousness is it! It creates the world from within to without, from mind to manifestation.  Ego uses guilt, anger, blame, judgment or criticism to create a self-reinforcing prison.  Changing perception changes reality.  Daya's words and inspirational story fire up the mental-emotional changes that can lead to a changed body image, enhanced relationships, goals achieved and transformation realized.   \nBookViral\u2019s Review - \"A faith-based and enlightened approach to overcoming life\u2019s challenges, Grow Thin While You Sleep proves a powerful catalyst for positive change. Highly accessible, Daya Devi-Doolin isn\u2019t an author to persuade her readers with undue complexity or make outlandish claims, but by candidly sharing her own experiences she invites her readers to take a step back and consider an alternative perspective. It\u2019s certainly compelling, and whilst you might find similar texts on the subject few authors inspire on the level that Daya Devi-Doolin does, or more importantly succeed in making the vital connection between spiritual and bodily well-being. In clear and concise prose her guidance is easy to visualize and follow. Through her own transformative experiences, both concept and execution are easy to incorporate in our daily regimes.

She has been with DATAMARK for 17 years, starting her career with the company in 2000 as a software developer. \n \n\u201cNina\u2019s long track record of success in delivering business process improvement solutions to our clients will be an asset in her new role as VP of Sales and Marketing,\u201d said DATAMARK President Bill Randag. \u201cNina\u2019s experience as a technical sales specialist and her deep understanding of the roles that people, process and technology play in business process management make her the ideal candidate for this position.\u201d \n \nBrown assumes the role of VP of Sales and Marketing during an exciting time of growth and expansion for DATAMARK. As a result of this recent growth, DATAMARK recently announced the opening of a second service delivery center in India, located in the country\u2019s financial and commercial center of Mumbai. DATAMARK\u2019s service footprint currently extends across multiple locations in the U.S., Mexico and India. \n \nAfter joining DATAMARK in 2000, Brown played an active role in leading software development projects for clients in the financial services, insurance and healthcare payer sectors, helping achieve new levels of process efficiency and cost savings. Brown later took on significant roles as a project manager, leading large-scale BPO transitions, including the launch of new consolidated mailroom services for a prominent leader in the banking industry in 2006. She then continued to partner with Sales and Marketing to expand partnerships, services, and locations and was instrumental in driving initiatives which led to over $15 million in new revenue for DATAMARK, including the expansion of a partnership in 2010 with a Fortune 100 financial services client, yielding the opening of a new domestic operational facility. \n \nIn 2012, Brown established DATAMARK\u2019s Business Engineering Department, to serve as a team of technical sales specialists for the company, and also introduced Consulting as a new service in the company portfolio. In this capacity, she and her Engineering department were involved in engagements which led to multiple new client partnerships as well as significant incremental revenue increases over the years. Thus, soon after, she was promoted to DATAMARK\u2019s Senior Management Team as Director of Engineering, responsible for oversight of the Business Engineering and Software Development and Validation departments. In this role, she continued to exceed client expectations, establishing DATAMARK as an industry leader in core business technology to enhance operational services, including the DATAMARK proprietary Document Tracking System and INDIGO Processing System. With her extensive experience with technology and process improvement, Nina has been uniquely poised to identify opportunities for business optimization and business growth, thus continuously working to strengthen and expand the DATAMARK client base. \n \nThroughout her career at DATAMARK, she has worked closely with the Sales and Marketing teams, applying her process redesign expertise to RFP responses and business process improvement solutions for clients. Brown has also represented DATAMARK as a subject matter expert in numerous webinar presentations, marketing videos, and at industry events and tradeshows. In her new role, Brown will integrate Business Engineering with Sales and Marketing, creating a cohesive structure for business development aligned with technical sales. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be leading our Sales and Marketing teams as DATAMARK moves to add new clients to our BPO and contact center services portfolio,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe will continue to build on our reputation as a business service provider that brings together best-fit technology solutions and a talented international workforce that acts with integrity to exceed the expectations of our partners for customer service, quality, timeliness and security.\u201d \n \nBrown is certified in Action Selling, is an ASQ-certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB) and a certified Project Management Professional (PMP). \n \nAbout DATAMARK \n \nDATAMARK, Inc. is a leading business process outsourcing company specializing in high-volume digital mailroom management, document processing/document management, contact center services, and process improvement consulting for Fortune 500 companies and other large enterprises. \n \nHeadquartered in El Paso, Texas, DATAMARK employs nearly 2,000 people in its U.S., Mexico and India facilities.

Their expenses must be trimmed, and the storage unit would be an excellent place to start. \n \nDEAR ABBY: How do you discourage someone\u2019s friendliness without being rude? \n \nAn elderly man recently moved in with his family in our neighborhood. He roams the neighborhood and approaches anyone he sees to introduce himself and start a conversation. He doesn\u2019t seem to have dementia, as he knows where and who he is, but his behavior is a little odd (such as asking for the precise spelling of everyone\u2019s first name). \n \nUnfortunately, now that he has met my husband and me, he comes up and knocks on the door to chat \u2013 weekdays, evenings, weekends. The last time I was outside with my three kids, he approached with a stack of photos and proceeded to show me at least 100 prints of a trip he had taken abroad \u2013 10 years ago. \n \nI feel trapped because I don\u2019t want to be mean to an old man, but I dread seeing him stroll down the road. What is the best way to deal with this situation? \u2013 WANTING TO WITHDRAW \n \nDEAR WANTING: The poor man is probably lonely and looking for human contact. Because you are not prepared to engage in his \u201cneighborly\u201d conversations, the next time he strolls by, tell him that you do not have time to chat right now. If he knocks on your door, tell him that you are busy or that you will be leaving shortly. And suggest to him that he may want to find a senior center so that he can make friends with contemporaries and won\u2019t feel so isolated. \n \nContact Dear Abby at www.DearAbby.com or P.O.

McGregor said that would be possible due to the Muhammad Ali Act that oversees boxing in the United States, but he'd still much rather work with the promotion regardless of the legal precedent.\n\n\"I believe so with the Ali Act, I believe I can (promote it), especially now that there's offers on the table. But I think it's smoother if we're all involved,\" McGregor said. \"I think we're all about good business.\n\n\"I've done great business with the UFC, with Dana (White), with everyone. I think it's smoother if everyone just gets together, we get it involved, but again everyone's got to know their place. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\"\n\nWhite seems to agree with McGregor when it comes to co-promoting alongside the UFC if he really wants the fight with Mayweather to generate the kind of life changing money he could make off the proposed boxing match.\n\n\"You know how I feel about Conor. I've always shown Conor nothing but respect and if he wants to go down that road with us, let me tell you, it will be an epic fall,\" White said at the FOX UFC Fight Night post fight press conference. that it's very possible the fight between them could realistically come together before the end of the year.\n\nThat being said, White still isn't willing to wager that the two biggest superstars in combat sports will ever come to an agreement to meet in the ring.\n\n\"Here's what I think the chances are -- about the same as me being the back up quarterback for (Tom) Brady on Sunday,\" White said.\n\nIt was just a couple of weeks ago that White offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each plus a cut of the pay-per-view profits to stage the mega-fight. White says he pressed the button on that offer because Mayweather continuously claimed that he was trying to put the fight together yet never actually reached out to him to ask about promoting the fight.\n\n\"Because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive) and he said that he had made an offer, which wasn't true. So I made a real offer. That was a real offer,\" White said.\n\nAs far as McGregor's numerous other comments on Saturday, including an Instagram tirade where he went on an expletive laced rant against the UFC, Mayweather, and the WWE, White didn't take any offense.\n\nMcGregor's post came just about an hour before he hit the stage in England for a pay-per-view interview that cost approximately $5 to view and White knows he was just trying to drum up some last minute business before going live.\n\n\"I didn't hear all that,\" White said. \"Hey listen, when you're about to go on and do a pay-per-view that you're charging people $5 to listen to you talk, I'm sure you've got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Damon Martin"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: MMA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White scoffs at McGregor promoting fight against Mayweather without the UFC","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"FOXNews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169589579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7648"},"name":"FOXNews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.foxnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/conor-mcgregor-expects-his-next-fight-to-be-against-floyd-mayweather-012817","http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/floyd-mayweather-responds-to-conor-mcgregor-after-fiery-interview-012917","http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/conor-mcgregor-blasts-the-ufc-wwe-and-floyd-mayweather-ahead-of-ppv-interview-012817"],"sequenceId":"695202644881","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:24Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://a57.foxnews.com/www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/images/2017/01/29/60/60/ufc-205-press-conference-51.vresize-741074f2136e9510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

In addition to showing Miller\u2019s paintings, Art Ventures will exhibit a suite of drawings, drenched in mystery and never before published. Combined with the dreamlike magic of his paintings, these drawings provide glimpses of something mystic and profound. Paton Miller will be attending the opening February 1st, and will be available for media interviews, upon appointment. \n \nAccording to Art Ventures Gallery Director Katharina Powers, \u201cWhat strikes me looking at Paton Miller\u2019s artwork is the purity of his dramatic landscapes. Paton provides an antidote to the so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d in which this generation, growing up with the Internet, lives. Paton\u2019s work provides a respite from the Internet and takes us out of algorithmized isolation. He takes us on a journey, and shows us what life is about.\u201d \n \nWriting in Art News, noted critic Donald Kuspit, said about Paton Miller\u2019s work, \u201cThese pictures make clear a familiar, but often forgotten point: that the expressivity of a representational scene often depends upon the abstract intensity generated in response to the medium. Without this visionary intensity, representational painting can become a kind of perceptual journalism. It becomes all the more important when the artist is picturing inner rather than overt horror. The achievement of ecstatic abstractness also indicates that the artist is master of the scene, rather than overwhelmed by what she or he is rendering \u2014 to make it appear magically upon command, which is what Miller\u2019s version of realism does.\u201d \n \nPaton Miller\u2019s work has been awarded the Painting Award at the Florence Biennale and is in public collections at American Embassy in Abu Dhabi and Bogotá, Colombia. Recent exhibitions include shows at White Room Gallery, NYC; Gallery Shchunkin, NYC; Galerie Yoram Gil, Beverly Hills; and Horwitch Newman Gallery, Scottsdale, AZ. \n \nFollowing the opening of his exhibit at the Art Ventures Gallery in Menlo Park, Miller will be in residence at the Art Ventures studio in Saint Helena from July through August. While there, Miller can engage with other visiting artists in the residency program, and create new work. In a program unique in the Bay Area art world, Art Ventures invites rising art stars from Europe to work shoulder to shoulder with their Californian colleagues in a purpose-built painting studio. Following their studio residency artists are invited to curate their own solo show at the Art Ventures Gallery exhibition space. \n \nThe result is groundbreaking: part exhibition space and part art movement. \n \nFor more information about Paton Miller and Art Ventures Gallery email info(at)artventuresgallery(dot)com \nArt Ventures Gallery is located at 888 Santa Cruz Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025. Paton Millers Artwork will be on display from February 1, 2017 through February 25. A reception for the artist will be held at Art Ventures Gallery Wednesday, February 1, from 5 pm to 7 pm.

On Thursday\u2019s Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the STAR EV Sirius took center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. \n \nAlthough primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry now encompasses a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion. STAR EV kept the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which boasts automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED illuminated dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). \n \nSTAR EV revealed two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a \u201ctricked-out\u201d version to show how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be painted a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also offers a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. \n \nWhile the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will expand to include 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic. As all STAR\u2019s vehicles, the Sirius is 100% electric with a 4 kW AC motor, 350 A Curtis AC controller, and can travel at a top speed of 19.5 mph. (The LSV version peaks at 25 mph.) The line officially launches in the summer of 2017, available through any of STAR\u2019s 250+ authorized dealers nationwide and internationally. \n  \nShare article on social media or email","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Retail industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Radio industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Sirius model from STAR Electric Vehicles makes its debut at PGA Merchandise Show","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"PRWeb","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661338","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5536"},"name":"PRWeb","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prweb.com","publisher":"PR Newswire"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyZXYuY29t","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyZXYuY29tL2RlYWxlci1sb2NhdG9yLw=="],"sequenceId":"695202647432","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(PRWEB)  January 29, 2017 \n \nQuartz Master is a quartz surfaces manufacturer, headquartered in Bayonne, New Jersey. The company produces the highest quality and largest quartz slabs in the industry. It distributes through many select locations in US and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. And is now expanding in California. \n \nThe demand for Quartz Master\u2019s Marble Collection prompted the company to open its first distribution center in California. In June 2016, Quartz Master opened its new 6500 square foot warehouse in Los Angeles to serve Los Angeles County. But within a couple of months, the distribution center was making deliveries to fabricators from as far south as San Diego to as far north as San Francisco. \n \nWhen it opened, the warehouse was stocked with a modest number of slabs, but within weeks it had to be restocked to meet demands. It now has millions in inventory. On January 2nd, they opened an office in San Diego, and on February 1st, an additional warehouse will open in San Francisco on Mariposa Avenue in Mountain View. \n \nQuartz Master is recognized for its Marble Collection. In 2011, after 12 months of laborious engineering, Quartz Master introduced the world\u2019s first marble design to Quartz. And in 2014, they perfected the art of book matching. Today, most all of their marble designs are book matched. Homeowners and interior designers appreciate the low maintenance, durability and unmatched stain resistance of quartz. And they love that they can design a kitchen that has the beauty of natural stone without the expense and hassle. \n \nTo meet demand and high-quality customer service, Quartz Master will have representatives throughout the state, who will supply showrooms, interior designers, and fabricators with samples and customer service. \n \nAbout Quartz Master \nQuartz Master is a world\u2019s experts of quartz surfaces. Quartz Master\u2019s slabs are made of 93% natural quartz and 7% resin, making it the hardest, most durable and non-precious stone in the market. Quartz Master produces the largest quartz slabs, 120\u201d x 64\u201d.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

YogaZo mobile yoga studio owner Ashley Fathergill is embracing the fad. \n \nThe latest trend in yoga is drinking beer during class. Mobile yoga studio YogaZo hosts Pints & Planks classes at local breweries, such as this one at Rio Bravo Brewing Company. \n  \nHer studio puts on classes every day, except Fridays, at local breweries around town, including Rio Bravo Brewing Company, Santa Fe Brewing ABQ, Duel Brewing Company, Dialogue Brewing and Marble Brewery. The Pints & Planks yoga courses have become so popular, she\u2019s had to hire five new yoga instructors. \n \nIt\u2019s not clear how the trend started but a studio in Germany, BierYoga, was one of the first to try the concept. Their tagline is \u201cThe original since 2015\u201d and the studio offers classes that actually incorporate beer drinking and the beer bottle into the yoga routines. According to its website, \u201cBeerYoga is the marriage of two great loves \u2013 beer and yoga. Both are centuries-old therapies for body, mind and soul. The joy of drinking beer and the mindfulness of yoga complement each other, and make for an energizing experience.\u201d The classes are held at bars, festivals and parties. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nFathergill has put her own spin on it though by hosting the courses in breweries and making the goal for people to make new friends. They also don\u2019t incorporate the beer into the routine. People can drink during the class, or not, and are encouraged to stay afterward to socialize. During every class, she asks everyone to introduce themselves to at least one person they don\u2019t know. The classes are held in the evening to coincide with typical workday schedules and the time most people socialize. \n \nAshley Fathergill is the owner of local mobile yoga studio YogaZo. \n  \n\u201cPeople like to go to happy hour after work,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving it in a brewery setting makes is seem like more of a gathering than a \u2018I have to go to this workout class.'\u201d \n \nMaking new friends was the reason Fathergill embraced yoga. Six years ago she moved to Albuquerque from Ohio and was having a hard time meeting new people. She enrolled in some classes as a way to meet people and said she ended up falling in love with yoga and decided to become an instructor. \n \nShe started her yoga business in September 2015, naming it after her dog Zoey who died earlier that year. Initially she rented a space and offered three classes a day but nobody showed up. \n \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any different than what was being offered,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed a hook.\u201d \n \nFathergill said she had heard of this idea of holding yoga in breweries and other urban spaces and so approached Rio Bravo Brewing Company on Second Street and pitched the idea to them. They agreed to test the concept. \n \n\u201cIt took off,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 20 to 40 people at each of our classes.\u201d \n \nFathergill charges $5 per class and most of the money is given to local nonprofit organizations. She pays her instructors but does not take a paycheck, instead using her full-time job in publishing sales to provide her income. \n \nThe classes have even attracted a large group of men, which she said is somewhat unusual for yoga. She said it\u2019s the atmosphere of the brewery, not necessarily the drinking, that attracts the large crowds and that some people do not even drink during the class. \n \n\u201cI think people immediately have an open mind to it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey already have positive feelings about it because it\u2019s a brewery.\u201d \n Pints & Planks \nThe yoga classes are held at local breweries by the YogaZo mobile yoga studio and cost $5 each.

(Rosalie Rayburn/Journal) \n  \n\u201cOur community trees are essential to all of our health and all of our well-being,\u201d said Bryan Suhr, founder of the nonprofit Think Trees New Mexico, which held its annual conference Jan. 19-20 to provide education and training for professionals who grow and care for trees. \n \nThe benefits of an urban canopy go well beyond the cooling relief of the shade they provide in our brown desert environment. Suhr said studies have shown urban trees can help slow storm runoff and reduce erosion, absorb carbon from the air, reduce dust pollution, even encourage customers to linger longer in shopping plazas. \n \nThe presence of trees encourages people to spend more time outside in their neighborhoods, Suhr said, bringing health benefits and helping to reduce street crime. \n \nCrab apple trees, with the roots balled and wrapped in burlap, rest on a trailer at Trees of Corrales. \n  \n\u201cI really believe trees are an inexpensive solution to a lot of the problems socially in our cities,\u201d said Andrew Lisignoli, who shares Suhr\u2019s passion for trees. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nLisignoli is sales manager at Trees of Corrales, a nearly 100-acre farm on the north side of Corrales that grows and sells around 20,000 trees annually to independent garden centers and landscapers in New Mexico, Arizona, West Texas and Utah. \n \nBut New Mexico\u2019s dry climate, vast temperature swings, harsh sunlight and strong winds make it a challenging environment for trees. A study published in 2012 in the journal Urban Forestry & Urban Greening said Albuquerque lost 2.7 percent of its total tree canopy between 2006 and 2009. \n \nTrees of Corrales grows trees from seeds and cuttings and buys young trees from suppliers in Oregon and plants them out in lines like this. The trees are left to grow for two to four years before they are ready to be prepared for sale. Trees of Corrales sells about 20,000 trees annually to distribution centers and landscapers in New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and West Texas. (Greg Sorber/Journal) \n  \n\u201cIn the summertime if you were to drive from the airport to any hotel you would see dead trees on the horizon. Those dead trees don\u2019t paint a welcome picture for industry to move to Albuquerque or businesses to come,\u201d Suhr said. \n \nHe praised Rio Rancho for starting a program in 2011 to train \u201ctree stewards,\u201d volunteers who monitor and help care for trees in local parks. The program, part of Keep Rio Rancho Beautiful, a division of the Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department, currently has 47 volunteers. Albuquerque doesn\u2019t have such a program. \n \nAlbuquerque City Forester Joran Viers said trees in city parks benefit from irrigation installed to maintain the grass. But, he said, commercial developers often don\u2019t consider how much space a tree needs to thrive when designing commercial spaces. There has also been a trend to remove turf and xeriscape with rocks to reduce water consumption. Viers supports efforts to conserve water but if not done correctly, it can be damaging to tree health. \n \n\u201cThe reality is, trees are big plants and they need a lot of water,\u201d said Viers. \n \nViers said the most common mistake is to put down permeable fabric and gravel and to place irrigation drip emitters at the tree base. The gravel absorbs heat, increasing the tree\u2019s need for water. However, the fine roots that absorb water needed to feed the tree are at the edge of its canopy not at the base, Viers said. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \n\u201cThe result is a heat stressed tree and progressive die-back of branches,\u201d said Viers. The process may take a few years and property owners may not realize what caused the problem. \n \nHe recommends replacing gravel and fabric with chipped wood that doesn\u2019t convert sunlight into heat and when watered will decay, contributing organic matter into the soil. Local chipped wood suppliers include Pete\u2019s Landscaping at 5200 Modesto NE and Soilutions at 9008 Bates Road SE, in the South Valley. \n \n\u201cResearch shows this helps stimulate tree growth, like a natural forest floor,\u201d Viers said. \n \nWatering routines differ depending on soil type, he said. Less frequent and deeper watering is best. He recommends watering enough to wet the soil up to a depth of 18 inches to 24 inches around the edge of the tree canopy. \n \n\u201cYou may have to run your drip systems for a few hours every other week instead of daily for a few minutes,\u201d Viers said. \n \nInstead of guessing, he suggests watering for a set period, then digging down until you reach dry soil and measuring the depth. \n \nDon\u2019t plant trees too deeply, he warned. The base roots should flare out just above the ground level. He recommended putting a layer of compost just beneath the wood chips but on top of the soil. Amending the soil around the tree roots below the surface, makes it harder for the roots and water to spread to surrounding earth. \n \n\u201cYou basically create a potted plant,\u201d Viers said. \n \nWhile Albuquerque\u2019s environment is tough on trees, there are several types that do well when planted correctly in an optimum location and properly watered. \n \nViers and Lisignoli mentioned Chinese pistache, honey locust, hybrid varieties of elm, red Texas oak and bur oak and hackberry. They said cottonwoods do best in valley soil near the Rio Grande. Stone fruit trees like cherries, which are popular around town, are prone to drought stress. The city of Albuquerque website cabq.gov also has a list of trees appropriate for planting in Albuquerque and the surrounding area.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Experts say trees could be the remedy for many of the city\u2019s problems","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87109","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Albuquerque Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660875","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3746"},"name":"Albuquerque Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abqjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://cabq.gov/"],"sequenceId":"695202650527","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The 13 episodes are to be released weekly to ebook and audio; each episode is about 40 minutes. Serial Box delivers the installments to digital devices. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nTregillis said he\u2019s been writing three episodes in the second season \u2013 No. 3 (\u201cOld Game, New Players\u201d), No. 9 (\u201cAftermath\u201d) and the concluding episode (\u201cWe All Fall Down\u201d). He also wrote three episodes for the novel\u2019s first season. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m the sole writer (of my episodes) but I write in consultation with the other writers on the team,\u201d Tregillis said. \u201cBefore we start writing, we have a pretty detailed idea of plot progression and story. But once you\u2019re writing episodes, you find yourself needing more detail than what\u2019s in the outline. If I make a decision, or if I forgot something, I make sure it doesn\u2019t break the season-long plan.\u201d \n \nHe\u2019s had a similar, yet different, collaborative writing experience with editors George R.R. Martin and Melinda Snodgrass of the \u201cWild Cards\u201d series of sci-fi novels. Tregillis contributed to about five of the 23 books in that series. He said the two series are similar in that there\u2019s a lot of give-and-take and negotiation and cooperation. But they differ in that Martin or Snodgrass would have a concept or broad outline, which is shared with the writers in the consortium; authors then pitch story ideas, Tregillis said. \n \nSerial Box says that its digital model blends story production and distribution practices from TV serials, narrative podcasting and book publishing. \n \n\u201cI think publishing, traditional publishing, has been in flux, at least in the genre world. Sci-fi/fantasy has seen a rise in ebooks. Publishing houses have been closing imprints, merging. In the 10 years I\u2019ve been a novelist, the publishing world has been changing,\u201d Tregillis said. \u201cThis model is a nice angle to find a niche for readers.\u201d \n \nSerial Box co-founder Julian Yap said in an email why and how Tregillis was picked for \u201cThe Witch\u201d writing team. \u201cIan,\u201d Yap said, \u201cwas one of the top names on our wish list due to his prior work \u2013 particularly \u2018The Milkweed Triptych.\u2019 Lindsay (Smith) and Max (Gladstone) commented that \u2018ideally, we\u2019d liked to find an author who writes like Ian Tregillis,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just ask Ian?'\u201d Smith and Gladstone are other writers for the series. \n \nIn putting together \u201cwish lists,\u201d Yap said, Serial Box and the project\u2019s lead author consider established best-selling authors, talented newcomers \u201cand everything in between.\u201d \n \nWhen not writing episodes or whole novels, Tregillis works as a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. \n  \nIndividual episodes of \u201cThe Witch\u201d are $1.99; a season subscription comes out to $1.59 per episode. In addition, a season pass is discounted at $19.99, which is paid upfront for the whole serial in both text and audio.

It was a job that left Brian Schaab well-known and liked in Hawke's Bay. \n \nHis dogged detective work eventually saw Mikus convicted in 2002 for killing Cormack, after a breakthrough in the case that happened when Cameron Schaab was only about 5 or 6. \n \n\"I don't really remember a huge deal of it, but Dad went on a trip to Washington DC with an envelope that had a couple of hairs, when DNA testing was cutting-edge, and that was the only place that could do it.\" \n \nHis father gave him some simple advice: to \"always go with your gut\". \n \n\"Even if things seem to line up on paper, but it's still not sitting right, then keep digging, and keep pushing on with it.\" \n \nBrian Schaab retired in February 2012, but kept busy with work that included becoming a volunteer driver for the Hawke's Bay Cancer Society. \n \nManager Trudy Kirk spoke through tears about Schaab, a \"wonderful\" man who had worked for a year with the group driving the shuttle van three times a week to Palmerston North Hospital for treatment. \n \n\"I get upset talking about him.

His commitment and enjoyment of the challenge of detective work made him a good investigator. \n \nSchaab is survived by four children. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JOEL MAXWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cop who caught Teresa's killer dies","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Press NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"189987471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"The Press NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202657858","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

He's so aggressive, even if he's not a tall guy,\" Guardiola told his post-match press conference. \n \n\"It's the first game, so it's not easy for him to communicate. He doesn't speak English. He will need time. But he makes a lot of movements. The pass for the first goal is outstanding. \n \n\"We cannot forget, we play with 21, 20 and 21 (sic) \u2013 three strikers so, so young. It's the future for Man City and all three played good.\" \n \nSane made a slow start to his City career following his close-season move from Schalke, but the Germany winger has now scored three goals in his last three appearances. \n \n\"He arrived a little bit scared, but it's normal when you arrive in a new country,\" Guardiola said. \n \n\"After the game against Arsenal (a 2-1 win on December 18) and his injury, they had four or five days off and he realised he had to make a step forward and he did it. \n \n\"Not just in terms of the goal, but his involvement in our game. Not just the actions, but the runs in behind, the quality and fighting. \n \n\"It's not easy for a player from another country coming here at 20, 21 years old and playing in a big club. Always he has to learn it's no option but to win, win, win.\" \n \nGuardiola was also pleased to see captain Vincent Kompany complete 90 minutes on his first outing since sustaining a knee injury during City's 2-1 win at Palace on November 19. \n \nVAN AANHOLT 'CLOSE' \n \n\"That is maybe one of the better news tonight,\" said the City manager. \n \n\"He was a long time injured and every time he came back he could not finish 90 minutes. \n \n\"He was two years injured, but the doctors and the physios and (surgeon) Ramon Cugat made an exceptional job.\" \n \nSergio Aguero was absent for City with a leg problem and Guardiola said he would be assessed before Wednesday's Premier League trip to West Ham United. \n \nGuardiola said Toure, who arced a free-kick into the top-left corner in injury time, had been \"perfect\" since returning to the team in the November win at Selhurst Park, in which he scored twice. \n \nBut Palace manager Sam Allardyce took a dimmer view of the Ivorian's contribution, arguing he should have been shown a second yellow card for tripping Jordon Mutch midway through the first half. \n \n\"They should have been down to 10 men,\" Allardyce said. \n \n\"Mutchy had been booked for much less a couple of minutes before. So the referee has not done his job for me, on the incident that Yaya did there. \n \n\"On the consistency of what the referee was doing in the game, it was an absolute certain yellow card. But I'm much more concerned about the goals we are conceding at the moment, rather than the referee.\" \n \nAllardyce confirmed Palace were close to completing a move for Sunderland left-back Patrick van Aanholt, but played down reports winger Andros Townsend is poised to rejoin Newcastle United. \n \n\"I think Van Aanholt is close,\" he said. \"Hopefully he will be involved (at Bournemouth) on Tuesday. \n \n\"I've no idea what the situation is with Andros other than the chairman has told me there has not been any type of bid whatsoever from Newcastle. So that's not even in the back of my mind.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester City news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Pep revels in glimpse of City's future","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperSport","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"161"},"name":"SuperSport","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.supersport.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/share"],"sequenceId":"695202660690","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:31:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.supersport.com/2017/1/Pep-Guardiola-170128-Applauds-G-80.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d\n\nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view.\n\nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d\n\nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d\n\nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite previously made headlines when he and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright.\n\nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout.\n\n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d\n\nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned.\n\nFor more on UFC on FOX 23, check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Staunton City","zipCode":"24402","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Staunton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169759113","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"169"},"name":"News Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695202664032","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"},{"url":"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/dana-white-post-ufc-on-fox-23.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 51 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202665923","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , today announced a global partnership to help improve vaccine supply chains in Gavi-supported countries. \n \nAs immunization programs expand to include new, life-saving vaccines and strive to reach more people, often in remote areas, they are increasingly constrained by outdated supply chains. With vaccine volumes continuing to increase and the persistence of often weak or broken health systems, there is a critical need for improvements in immunization supply chain infrastructure. \n \nOver the next three years, the new partnership will be vital in helping to provide countries with efficient supply chain solutions to improve health care delivery. Deutsche Post DHL Group\u2019s industry leading logistics expertise in life sciences and healthcare combined with the global DHL transportation network will help countries overcome challenges, and make the vaccine supply chain more efficient. This can help countries increase immunization coverage, reduce vaccine wastage and better ensure vaccine availability and potency and will ultimately help reduce child mortality. \n \nKenya is one of the first countries to benefit from the new partnership, announcing a new initiative with DHL, the logistics unit of Deutsche Post DHL Group. Gavi and DHL, toegehter with the Kenyan Ministry of Health will test a dedicated transportation management solution for the efficient distribution of vaccines throughout the East African country. Incorporating a control tower called a Transport Support Hub, to better manage and coordinate third-party transport carriers and the use of DHL\u2019s own global transportation network, the solution will improve the speed and reliability of vaccine deliveries to hospitals, clinics and medical professionals in the country. \n \n\u201cWe are proud to support Gavi in its important societal role,\u201d said Frank Appel, CEO of Deutsche Post DHL Group. \u201cThis enhanced relationship will allow Deutsche Post DHL Group to contribute its world class supply chain expertise and network towards making a real difference to vaccine distribution in the developing world \u2013 and, with this, to improve lives.\u201d \n \nSeth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, emphasized the importance of this partnership. \u201cRobust vaccine supply chains are a vital part of building strong health systems, so that children, parents, and communities can be reached wherever they live with life-saving vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cDHL\u2019s expertise in healthcare delivery and its footprint in sub-Saharan Africa will help the partnership develop and test new innovative solutions aimed at increasing the health impact in Gavi-supported countries.\u201d \n \nThis project aligns directly with Gavi\u2019s private sector engagement strategy, which seeks to build a cluster of a private sector partners to address critical bottlenecks to immunisation coverage and equity in Gavi-supported countries. By focusing the skills, expertise, and technology of the private sector on the immunisation supply chain, data quality, and demand generation, Gavi aims to accelerate progress and achieve lasting impact. \n \nDeutsche Post DHL Group\u2019s new engagement with Gavi is guided by the Shared Value proposition, the notion that Deutsche Post DHL Group and Gavi can partner to contribute to society and the environment while, at the same time, contributing to the success of Deutsche Post DHL Group\u2019s business. \n \nThe post appeared first on Global Trade Magazine .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"International development news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Improving Vaccine Deliveries in Developing Countries","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Global Trade Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"553064432","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"160"},"name":"Global Trade Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.globaltrademag.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202667501","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But a bunch of determined wrestlebacks yielded a flurry of fifth-place finishes that allowed the Stars to sneak into third place as a team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not real sure how did that, but we had a bunch of fifth-place finishes, and you have to credit all those guys for showing a lot of heart and coming back to win their last matches of the season,\u201d said BNL coach Roy Bruce. \u201cHopefully, that will build some momentum for those kids heading into next season.\u201d\n\nAbel earned a bye in the first round at 126, and pinned Jasper\u2019s Landon Betz at the 3:27 mark in the third round to advance to the championship match. There he encountered Southridge\u2019s Sammy Schroeder, who got Abel\u2019s shoulders down just two seconds ahead of the first-period buzzer.\n\nIkerd battled through a sprained knee to earn fourth at 138 and punch his ticket to regional. He got a bye at the outset and was pinned by Jasper Geordan Terwiske in the second round, but received a forfeit and then pinned Crawford County\u2019s Derak Gabbard in 2:28 to gain a spot in the third/fourth place match. Terwiske got him again, but Ikerd advanced (the top four individuals in each class move on).\n\n\u201cJared was seeded second and today he was the second-best wrestler in his class,\u201d Abel said. \u201cHe had a real good day, but he just got caught by the kid there at the end of the first period. He was a little too worried about defending the guy instead of attacking him, and that will get you caught, but he had a nice day.\n\n\u201cJackson sprained his MCL 10 days ago and I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d even wrestle, but the trainer gave him the go-ahead and we got him all braced up and he was able to go. He couldn\u2019t take a shot because of the leg, but he was able to throw guys, and he was up against a Crawford County kid who had only lost six times all season. But Jackson got him in a side headlock and put him away to get into the fourth-place match. We really appreciate the effort those two guys put forth today.\u201d\n\nThe Stars got fifth-place finishes from Chelsey Schofield at 106, Logan Riddle at 113, Derek Hutchins at 120, Ray Lee at 132, Ben Weaver at 182 and Tristan Hanner at 195. Bruce was also proud of his two seniors, Koby Werner and Judah Edwards, both of whom suffered misfortune.\n\n\u201cKoby got the flu on Tuesday and started to recover, but then he got extremely sick again Friday night and just couldn\u2019t go today,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThat\u2019s really emotional for me to see a four-year wrestler who has given us so much, and who was there all summer busting his hump to get ready, and then he doesn\u2019t get to wrestle at sectional. I really hate it.\n\n\u201cThen Judah was wrestling to advance against a Jasper kid, and he was winning the match when he banged his head off the mat and got a concussion. There was no way he could continue, and again I just hate it for him as a senior. It was a really rough way for both of them to go out, but we certainly respect and appreciate all they did for our program.\u201d\n\nMitchell took just eight wrestlers to the sectional, but wound up with two titleholders as senior Delaney Wade prevailed at 220 and junior Ethan Bohkenkamp captured the crown at 160. Senior Greg Brown was runner-up at 195, senior Caleb Slaughter also advanced to regional by finishing fourth at 182, and senior Austin Kirk moved on via a fourth-place finish at 152. The Bluejackets got a fifth-place finish from Trey Slone at 170\n\nBohnenkamp (30-4) had a bye in the first round at 160 and blitzed Paoli\u2019s Chaz Becht in 48 seconds in the second round. He battled to a tough 12-8 decision over Salem\u2019s Damien Miller in the semifinals and slammed Washington\u2019s Sam Smith in 1:54 to take the title.\n\nWade (28-1) didn\u2019t have to wrestle until the semis because of byes and forfeits, and he disposed of Southridge\u2019s Jose Chavez in 2:41 to reach the final. There he met Salem\u2019s Aaron Hollen, and it was no match as Wade got a pin in 1:20 to collect the big hardware.\n\nBrown (29-4) suffered a heartbreaker at 195, dropping a 3-1 overtime decision to Southridge\u2019s Jack Michel (43-2) in the championship match.\n\nTimmy Burton (35-4) of Paoli punched his ticket to regional by placing second at 152, dropping a tough 5-2 decision to Southridge\u2019s Tucker Schank in the title match. Will Stroud (22-8) also earned a runner-up spot at 138, falling 7-1 in the final to Southridge\u2019s Drew Dearing in the finale, and Zayne Bartholomew picked up Paoli\u2019s third runner-up finish at at 132 with a 5-3 overtime setback to Southridge\u2019s Chanler Balsmeyer in the championship bout.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 James Beavers advanced to regional with a third-place run at 285, and Kain Yother finished fourth at 113 to earn another week of competition.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Times-Mail"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"BNL places 3rd, Mitchell claims 2 titles at Southridge","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lawrence","zipCode":"47446","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Mitchell","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bedford Times-Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669877","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"55"},"name":"Bedford Times-Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tmnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202674143","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tmnews.com/content/tncms/custom/image/76e54fb8-677a-11e5-afa8-031fb36ab07b.png?_dc=1443621138"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico. \n \nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends. \n \nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again?

Rulings out of federal courts in Massachusetts, Virginia, and Washington \u2014 all siding with challengers to Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 followed. \n\nChris Geidner BuzzFeed News Reporter Tom Namako BuzzFeed News Reporter Cora Lewis BuzzFeed News Reporter A federal judge in Brooklyn on Saturday evening granted a nationwide stay of removal \u2014 preventing deportation \u2014 for those people affected by President Trump\u2019s Friday executive order stopping the refugee program and halting immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\n\"Nobody is to be removed,\" US District Judge Ann Donnelly told the government lawyers, issuing the stay after holding the first hearing on a challenge to the order.\n\nIn the order that followed, Donnelly barred federal officials from removing those with approved refugee applications, valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, and individuals from the seven countries where all immigration was halted who are otherwise legally authorized to enter the US. Those seven countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen.\n\nSeveral hours later, after a late-night hearing in a federal courthouse in Massachusetts, US District Judge Allison Burroughs and Magistrate Judge Judith Dein issued an order early Sunday morning that \u2014 as the petitioners\u2019 lawyers had requested \u2014 went further, barring federal officials from detaining, in addition to removing, the same group covered by Donnelly\u2019s order and adding those same protections, explicitly, to lawful permanent residents.\n\nAdditionally, Burroughs and Dein\u2019s order limits secondary screening to pre-Trump order status and order US Customs and Border Protection to \"notify airlines that have flights arriving at Logan [International] Airport of this order and the fact that individuals on these flights will not be detained or returned solely on the basis of the Executive Order.\"\n\nWhile there remained questions about the nationwide application of either or both orders, particularly the Massachusetts order, the terms of the orders \u2014 limiting federal officials from detaining or removing those affected by Trump\u2019s order \u2014 contained no explicit limitation to the district in which they were granted.\n\nIn between those two rulings, two more localized rulings came from federal courts in Virginia and Washington. In the case filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered federal officials to provide lawyers access to \"all legal permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport\" and barred officials from deporting any such people for the next seven days. In the case out of Washington state, US District Judge Thomas Zilly barred the federal government from deporting two unnamed individuals from the US. Zilly set a hearing for Feb. 3 \"to determine whether to lift the stay.\"\n\nThe New York-based lawsuit that started things rolling had been brought early Saturday on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, two men detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport for several hours after their arrival at the airport in the wake of Trump\u2019s signing of the ban.\n\nIn addition to the two men, however, the group of lawyers backing the men also to turn the lawsuit into a class action, which would result in protection for all of those who would be covered by the class.\n\nLater, they sought immediate action, t that the court issue a stay of removal \u2014 an order preventing deportation \u2014 not only for the two men, but for the entire proposed class.\n\nAt the hearing in the first case, Donnelly focused in on whether the people affected by Trump\u2019s order would face irreparable harm if deported.\n\nGisela Ann Westwater, a lawyer from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Immigration Litigation, presented the bulk of the government\u2019s defense over the phone, with support from Susan Riley, who was in person at the hearing.\n\nWhile discussing whether irreparable harm would be brought onto people who were detained and would be sent back to the countries they came from, the judge referenced an unnamed person who the ACLU\u2019s Lee Gelernt, who argued for the challengers, said was being sent back to Syria.\n\nDonnelly turned to the government\u2019s lawyers, asking, \"What do you think about that?\" Westwater began to make the case, briefly, about concerns based on those trying to come to the US on tourist visas.\n\nThe judge, however, interrupted her and delivered her order, questioning whether \"the government had a full chance to think about this.\"\n\nAt another point in the hearing, Gelernt told Donnelly that the petitioner\u2019s lawyers estimate 100 to 200 people are being detained across the country as a result of Trump\u2019s order.\n\nWhen Gelernt pressed for the government to turn over names of those detained and the government responded that it did not know who all of those people being detained are, Donnelly said the government should compile a list.\n\nIn a follow-up order to the stay, Donnelly ordered the government \"to provide a list of individuals detained, pursuant to the January 27, 2017 Executive Order, to the petitioner\u2019s counsel.\"\n\nFurther proceedings in the case, ultimately challenging the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s order, are set for February. The government\u2019s brief responding to the petition is due Feb. 10.\n\nThe lawyers who brought the case come from International Refugee Assistance Project, National Immigration Law Center, American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, and the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School.\n\nThe Massachusetts court\u2019s order, meanwhile, will remain in effect for 7 days, with the court to schedule a further hearing before that time.\n\nRead the order in the New York case: Read the order in the Virginia case: Read the order in the Washington case: Read the order in the Massachusetts case: This is a developing story.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 48 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202680236","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n \nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n \nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n \nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n___ \n \n9:40 p.m. \n \nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n \nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n \nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n \nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n \n___ \n \n7 p.m. \n \nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n \nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n \nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n \nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n \nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n \n___ \n \n1 a.m. \n \nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n \n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n \nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n \n____ \n \n12:20 a.m. \n \nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n \nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n \nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n \nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n \nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \n___ \n \n12:10 a.m. \n \nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n \nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n \nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n \nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n \nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n \n____ \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n \nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n \nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n \n____ \n \n11:20 p.m. \n \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n \nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n \nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n \nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n \nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n \nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n \n___ \n \n10:20 p.m. \n \nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n \nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n \nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n \nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \n___ \n \n9:50 p.m. \n \nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n \n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n \nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n \n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n \n___ \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n \nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n \nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n \nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n \nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n \n___ \n \n8 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n \nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n \nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n \nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n___ \n \n7:05 p.m. \n \nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n \nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n \nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nTrump signed the order Friday. \n \n___ \n \n6:40 p.m. \n \nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n \nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n \nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n \nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n \nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n___ \n \n6:35 p.m. \n \nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n \n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n \nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n \nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n \n___ \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n \nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n \nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n \nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n \nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n \n___ \n \n5:15 p.m. \n \nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n \nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n \nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n \n___ \n \n3 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n \nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n___ \n \n2:45 p.m. \n \nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n \nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n \nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n \nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n \n___ \n \n1 p.m. \n \nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n \nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n \nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n \nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n \n___ \n \n12:30 p.m. \n \nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n \nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n \nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n \nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Middlesex","zipCode":"02149","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Everett","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Boston Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661766","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Boston Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bostonherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202681475","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

No government wants any of its ministries to be mired in constant controversies. The President was being kind to the Minister when he characterised the problems at the Ministry of Public Health as being administrative in nature. It is clear that there were mostly problems of governance. \n \nThe minister was doomed once the bond scandal broke. The PPP, itself under the corruption microscope, was bound to milk the issue for more than it was worth. But that whole fiasco should be a signal to the government that it must beware of these moneyed interests who would lure public officials into unsavoury deals. After the experience of the PPP, the society at large has little patience with anything that resembles corruption and cover-up of deals. So, the President, despite his stated support for his troops, had to move. The very integrity of the government was at stake and one cannot have such an important ministry buried in suspicion. Clearly, the minister had lost control of the ministry. \n \nI suspect the President was in a tight spot. Under normal circumstances, he might have removed the minister from the Cabinet to send a signal to other ministers and the society at large that there was strong aversion to official improprieties. But he had to be mindful of the sensitivities of the PNC, of which Minister Norton is a senior member and he, the President, is leader. He also had to be mindful of ethnic sensitivities; the minister is Amerindian, a group that is often most marginalised from formal power. These are the partisan and ethnic realities that make governing so difficult in Guyana. \n \nI hope that the appointment of a new minister to the job is not seen as a final solution. There must be a change of approach to public procurement and other matters of governance at the Ministry of Public Health and in the government in general. I am not suggesting that there is corruption in government, but the President must read the riot act to his ministers\u2014stay far away from even a hint of corruption and nepotism. Be as transparent as possible on the matter of resource allocation. \n \nBribery of State officials by those with the means to do so is a central aspect of official corruption. Ministers and top government officials must resist the temptation to take these \u201cgifts\u201d for the bearers of gifts always want something in return. And we live in a country where the previous government made that mode of operation normative. \n \nIt is also commonplace that those who gave big donations to the campaign would demand their \u201cpound of flesh,\u201d but ministers must push back against such forces. The process must be fair and just. If there must be Affirmative Action, it must not be for friends, but for those who have been unfairly shut out of the system. And such corrective action must be enshrined in the law. Whether the ministers of Government acknowledge it or not, the government came to power as an anti-corruption government. \n \nThe President had to put Minister Norton somewhere, so he sent him to the Ministry of Social Cohesion. That is a big gamble. That ministry is pivotal to the government\u2019s stated desire for national and ethnic reconciliation. The minister must have a strong desire for that kind of delicate work and should be pro-active in giving leadership to a sensitive undertaking. I don\u2019t know that Minister Norton has an interest in or a passion for that work. One does not necessarily have to be part of the profession to manage a given subject area. But I think on this matter of Social Cohesion, the subject minister should be someone who has a key understanding of the ministry\u2019s mandate and the wherewithal to execute. We shall see. \n \nThe Madness on our Roads Must Stop \nIt is now generally accepted that our roadways have become very dangerous. Hardly a day passes without some serious accident often leading to serious injury or death. This problem has plagued Guyana for a long time, but despite public pleadings for caution, the situation seems to be worsening. A civilised society cannot turn a blind eye to carnage on its roadways. \n \nWhat is happening on our roads is a clear case of lawlessness. Our motorists are out of control. From mini-bus drivers to private motorists, there is almost total [dis]regard for the law, for limb and for life. There are reports of drivers breaking traffic laws in full view of the police. Others ignore the right of pedestrians to share the public space and refuse to give way to them. Often children and elderly citizens become victims of the rage on the roadways. \n \nThis problem on the roadways is a symptom of a larger problem of indiscipline in the society. Something must be done urgently. The problem must be tackled at various levels. First, the police have to launch a zero-sum campaign against indiscipline on our roadways. The traffic laws must be enforced. Of course, there is the problem of corruption, whereby motorists are in the habit of bribing the police. However, that should not be a deterrent to bold action. I am cognisant that we do not have enough police ranks to man the streets. Perhaps the government should consider the setting up of a special traffic force made up of part-time officers. \n \nThe second area of repair must be the general education of drivers. There should be more rigorous training of potential drivers that goes beyond a road test. These new drivers should be mandated to attend more formal classes on road safety and ethics on the roadways. Third, the penalty for those found guilty of traffic infractions, particularly dangerous driving, should be increased. We cannot continue like this. \n \nMore of Dr. Hinds \u2018writings and commentaries can be found on his YouTube Channel Hinds\u2019 Sight: Dr. David Hinds\u2019 Guyana-Caribbean Politics and on his website www.guyanacaribbeanpolitics.com.

Captain Scott Curry restored the host's lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. \n \nBut another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \nHaving won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn't particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. \n \nKoroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. \n \nTalent of the sort that made Manawatu's Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. \n \n\"He's probably better than me,\" Cama said of Koroi. \n  \nThe teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. \n \n\"This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he's been playing for a few years now. There's always things to work on and hopefully he's going to kick on from now,\" said Cama. \n \n\"When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that's when they look forward and make decisions.\" \n \nIt's Koroi's composure that really excites Cama. \n \n\"At this stage I don't have to do a lot. He's got all the talent. If anything it's just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best.\" \n \nKoroi can't quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. \n \n\"I've been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous,\" Koroi said. \n \nIt's just that he hasn't played like a nervous bloke. \n \n\"Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you're a playmaker.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Zealand end Wellington Sevens with defeat to Argentina","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nelson Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744542","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Nelson Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202684980","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There has reportedly been a flurry of activity in the past several weeks to address leaky roofs, broken equipment, peeling paint and other conditions some say make the campus appear substandard.\n\nThe complaints were aired at a town hall meeting late last year, during which faculty also complained about adequate classroom and laboratory space. Subsequent interviews with personnel revealed conditions that ranged from what some instructors called \u201cembarrassing\u201d to those that actually hinder researchers from conducting experiments.\n\nFollowing the town hall meeting, Chancellor Kim Wilcox announced personnel changes in the administration of the facilities department. In an interview in December, he said repair and renovation projects were being prioritized.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard in the last few weeks to move that along faster,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nOne of the changes Wilcox made was to put Mike Pazzani, vice chancellor of research, in charge of overseeing the campus\u2019 facilities. Pazzani said he realizes there is a serious problem.\n\n\u201cWe all feel the urgency of this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair for faculty not to be able to do their research and for students not to have classrooms.\u201d\n\nPhysics professor Ward Beyerman said his lab struggles with keeping a suitably clean environment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of black stuff that comes out of the ventilators,\u201d Beyerman said.\u201d Sometimes you\u2019ll come in and there\u2019s black stuff all over your desk. In any lab where they\u2019re doing optical experiments if you have dirt coming in from the ventilation system, that degrades the optics. Optics get dirty with time. Here that time period is a lot shorter than one might expect.\u201d\n\nBeyerman said his team has installed filters in the ventilation system, but they don\u2019t completely take care of the problem. And there are other issues as well.\n\nThere is water damage from leakage in the walls, he said. The lab sits partly below grade.\n\n\u201cWe have seepage in places,\u201d he said. It has damaged lab equipment, he added.\n\nPazzani said he has accelerated repair and renovation work. Over the recent holiday break, he said, about 30 faculty offices were painted and new carpeting was installed in the campus\u2019 largest lecture hall. Damaged seats in the 500-seat hall \u2013 Pazzani estimated 5 percent needed repair or replacement \u2013 were also fixed.\n\nThe campus has about $100 million in deferred maintenance, he said, noting that was not unusual for a university the size of UCR. However, he added, at the two other universities where he has worked \u2013 UC Irvine and Rutgers \u2013 \u201cthey were are little bit quicker at getting these things done.\u201d\n\nMany of the problems faculty complained about pre-date Wilcox\u2019s tenure. The degrading of some facilities, researchers said, is a long-standing issue.\n\nOne researcher, who declined to be named, said leaks in the roof of the entomology lab \u2013 also an old building \u2013 require workers there to put out buckets when it rains. It\u2019s been a problem for at least 10 years, he said, and has resulted in large areas where the paint has peeled away and hangs from the ceiling. Periodically, dissolved concrete falls from the ceiling.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MARK MUCKENFUSS"},"topics":[{"name":"Inland Empire news","group":"US regional"}],"title":"What's being done to fix UC Riverside's broken buildings?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Riverside","zipCode":"92501","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Riverside","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Riverside Press Enterprise","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667020","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Riverside Press Enterprise","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pe.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://pe.subscriberconcierge.com/subscriptionpanel?pid=22"],"sequenceId":"695202685368","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/okgo43-b88882586z.120170127150222000glslce1c.10.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their dominant win in Wellington.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sydney or the bush for NZ","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nelson Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744542","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Nelson Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202685548","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention, or whether it would allow others to resume flying.\n\n\"Realistically, we don't even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes,\" said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt. \"This order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach U.S. soil.\"\n\nUnder Trump's order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas. However, an official with the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday night that no green-card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump's order had been prevented from entering the U.S. Some foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday had been detained at U.S. airports, told they were no longer welcome. The DHS official who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.\n\nIn her three-page order, Donnelly wrote that without the stay \"there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders and other individuals from nations subject to the Jan. 27, 2017, executive order.\"\n\nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\n\nTrump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war.\n\nThe directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the Sept. 11 hijackers.\n\nAs a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the U.S., then said he would implement \"extreme vetting\" for people from countries with significant terror concerns. He told reporters Saturday the order is \"not a Muslim ban.\"\n\n\"It's working out very nicely,\" Trump said of the implementation of his order. \"We're going to have a very, very strict ban and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\" The order sparked protests at several of the nation's international airports, including New York's Kennedy and Chicago's O'Hare and facilities in Minneapolis and Dallas-Forth Worth. In San Francisco, hundreds blocked the street outside the arrival area of the international terminal. Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \"Portland Coffee Is From Yemen\" and chanting anti-Trump slogans.\n\nU.S. lawmakers and officials around the globe also criticized the move. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said while Trump is right to focus on border security, the order is \"too broad.\"\n\n\"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\" Sasse said. \"Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\"\n\nIn Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would stop issuing new visas to U.S. citizens in response to Trump's ban, but that anyone already with a visa to Iran wouldn't be turned away.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter Saturday afternoon to say that refugees were welcome in Canada, \"regardless of your faith.\"\n\nTwo of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the U.S. military. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York's Kennedy airport Friday night. Both had been released by Saturday night after their lawyers intervened.\n\nThe government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied. Diplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump's order would still be allowed into the U.S.\n\nThose already in the U.S. with a visa or green card would be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump's order also directed U.S. officials to review information as needed to fully vet foreigners asking to come to the U.S. and draft a list of countries that don't provide that information. That left open the possibility that citizens of other countries could also face a travel ban.\n\nThe U.S. may still admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government would continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.\"\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of Trump's order.\n\n\"There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\" said Lena F. Masri, the group's national litigation director. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\"\n\nJohn Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations, said the order didn't address America's \"primary terrorism-related threat\" - people already in the U.S. who become inspired by what they see on the internet. Trump's order drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program, particularly for those from Syria.\n\n\"We are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us,\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said in a statement Friday. \"With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.\"\n\nIt is unclear how many people would be immediately impacted by the non-refugee travel ban. According to the statistics maintained by the Homeland Security Department, about 17,000 students from the seven designated countries were allowed into the U.S. for the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015 more than 86,000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. on other, non-immigrant visas and more than 52,000 others became legal permanent residents.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"US judge bars deportations under Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ng.Newshub.org","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"546829406","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ng.Newshub.org","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ng.newshub.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://abc7chicago.com/news/lawsuit-filed-after-travel-ban-forces-detentions-at-ny-airport/1726151/"],"sequenceId":"695202690553","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://newshub.org/img/article/600/us-judge-bars-deportations-under-trump-travel-ban-25225484.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

None of these laid our vision of how we thought the process should be addressed. With our focus on legal technology and its application our advice is naturally more on the practical than legal. However, we have represented the legal framework as much as we need to within the LTPI purview. We've all witnessed too many drive-by Meet & Confers when one sides ignorance of the process led to shoddy client representation. With this guide, there is no longer any excuse.\" \n \nThe guide is broken into 4 stages: pre-conference, activities at the conference, post conference, and \"common pitfalls\", providing practical guidance and checklist items and related strategic considerations to streamline the process and avoid any missed steps. It is a valuable resource to both the novice and the expert. \n \nThe project team members include Bob Rohlf (Exterro), Peter Pepiton (Dinsmore), Chris Paskach (The Claro Group), P.

BNL appeared to take the 10-12 Braves lightly, but Indian Creek had some holdovers from a 21-5 sectional-championship team, and it caught BNL flat-footed at the defensive end. The Braves got seven points from center Caitlyn Snyder and two 3-pointers from Katie Burkman in the first period to take an 18-15 lead at the first break.\n\n\u201cI was a little perturbed, but it\u2019s easy for a coach to be upset and what I\u2019m more concerned about is how my kids respond,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe took a timeout there (with 2:10 left in the first quarter) and they could see on my face that I wasn\u2019t real pleased.\n\n\u201cIndian Creek played really hard and we didn\u2019t come out ready to play, but they responded well the rest of the game.\u201d\n\nThe Lady Stars found their anchor and oars in the second stanza. A halfcourt trapping defense interrupted Indian Creek\u2019s rhythm, and BNL cranked up its running game on offense.\n\nAllen scored twice in transition, Messmore hit a fast-break layup, and the Lady Stars went 5 for 8 from the arc with Bunch (twice), Messmore and Jacy Hughes all connecting as BNL blazed to a 26-point period and 41-29 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to work on some things as far as mixing up our defenses and switching them faster, and we wanted to get out and go with the ball today,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThere were a couple of glitches, but all in all we executed pretty well after the first quarter.\u201d\n\nThe Braves kept battling and sliced the margin to nine behind the play of forward Madelyn Gary, IC\u2019s lone senior playing her final home game. She converted a three-point play to narrow it to 45-36 with 5:40 showing in the third. But after a free throw by Allie Crulo-Rood, Fugate took a charge and then swished a rainbow trey to restore order.\n\nMessmore slashed down the lane on a fast-break drive, and Bunch buried another 3-pointer as the Lady Stars pulled back out to a 56-42 lead going to the fourth. When Allen posted up twice in a row to score starting the fourth quarter the outcome was no longer in doubt. BNL, which shot 53 percent (27 of 51) from the field and committed 11 turnovers, led by as much as 24 late in the game.\n\nGary finished with 13 points and six rebounds for Indian Creek, which committed 15 miscues, shot 14 for 42 (.333) from the field, and was outrebounded, 34-25.\n\nFugate added 11 points and six boards, while Jacy Hughes had seven points for the Lady Stars (17-4), who face the Owls (15-8) in the second game Tuesday night at Galena, following the 6 p.m. opener between Jennings County (9-14) and Floyd Central (13-10). Jeffersonville (16-7) and New Albany (15-6) drew first-round byes.\n\nContact Times-Mail Sports Writer Jeff Bartlett at (812) 277-7285, jeffb@tmnews.com, or on Twitter @jeffbtmnews., w\n\nBEDFORD NL STARS (75)\n\nFG FT R F TP\n\n3 Kennedy Bunch, f 7-11 0-0 2 4 19\n\n2 Allie Crulo-Rood, f 1-2 1-2 1 1 3\n\n33 Jorie Allen, c 6-9 6-9 8 3 18\n\n23 McKenzie Messmore, g 7-10 0-1 7 0 15\n\n12 Jacy Hughes, g 2-8 1-2 2 2 7\n\n22 Allie Fugate 4-8 0-0 6 5 11\n\n11 Halle Hughes 0-2 0-0 3 3 0\n\n21 Kiana Brown 0-0 0-2 1 0 0\n\n20 Sara Peterson 0-0 0-0 0 0 0\n\n30 Katie Fisher 0-1 2-3 1 1 2\n\n24 Gracie Crulo-Rood 0-0 0-0 0 0 0\n\nTotals 27-51 10-19 34 19 75\n\nINDIAN CREEK BRAVES (54)\n\nFG FT R F TP\n\n22 Katie Burkman, f 3-8 1-3 5 3 10\n\n24 Caitlyn Snyder, f 3-5 6-7 3 3 12\n\n20 Madelyn Gary, f 4-9 5-6 6 3 13\n\n5 Addie Rund, g 2-12 5-8 3 3 9\n\n11 Hannah Grider, g 0-2 2-2 2 3 2\n\n4 Makenzi Sizemore 0-1 2-2 0 0 2\n\n15 Stevye Gonzales 1-4 0-0 1 0 3\n\n21 Lauren Pendleton 1-1 0-0 2 0 3\n\n32 Heather Maddox 0-0 0-0 0 0 0\n\n42 Evelyn Cline 0-0 0-0 1 0 0\n\nTotals 14-42 21-28 25 15 54\n\nBedford NL 15 26 15 19--75\n\nIndian Creek 18 11 13 12--54\n\nTurnovers -- BNL 11; IC 15.\n\n3-Point Goals -- BNL 10-20 (Bunch 5-8, Fugate 3-6, J.

She has been with DATAMARK for 17 years, starting her career with the company in 2000 as a software developer. \n \n\"Nina's long track record of success in delivering business process improvement solutions to our clients will be an asset in her new role as VP of Sales and Marketing,\" said DATAMARK President Bill Randag. \"Nina's experience as a technical sales specialist and her deep understanding of the roles that people, process and technology play in business process management make her the ideal candidate for this position.\" \n \nBrown assumes the role of VP of Sales and Marketing during an exciting time of growth and expansion for DATAMARK. As a result of this recent growth, DATAMARK recently announced the opening of a second service delivery center in India, located in the country's financial and commercial center of Mumbai. DATAMARK's service footprint currently extends across multiple locations in the U.S., Mexico and India. \n \nAfter joining DATAMARK in 2000, Brown played an active role in leading software development projects for clients in the financial services, insurance and healthcare payer sectors, helping achieve new levels of process efficiency and cost savings. Brown later took on significant roles as a project manager, leading large-scale BPO transitions, including the launch of new consolidated mailroom services for a prominent leader in the banking industry in 2006. She then continued to partner with Sales and Marketing to expand partnerships, services, and locations and was instrumental in driving initiatives which led to over $15 million in new revenue for DATAMARK, including the expansion of a partnership in 2010 with a Fortune 100 financial services client, yielding the opening of a new domestic operational facility. \n \nIn 2012, Brown established DATAMARK's Business Engineering Department, to serve as a team of technical sales specialists for the company, and also introduced Consulting as a new service in the company portfolio. In this capacity, she and her Engineering department were involved in engagements which led to multiple new client partnerships as well as significant incremental revenue increases over the years. Thus, soon after, she was promoted to DATAMARK's Senior Management Team as Director of Engineering, responsible for oversight of the Business Engineering and Software Development and Validation departments. In this role, she continued to exceed client expectations, establishing DATAMARK as an industry leader in core business technology to enhance operational services, including the DATAMARK proprietary Document Tracking System and INDIGO Processing System. With her extensive experience with technology and process improvement, Nina has been uniquely poised to identify opportunities for business optimization and business growth, thus continuously working to strengthen and expand the DATAMARK client base. \n \nThroughout her career at DATAMARK, she has worked closely with the Sales and Marketing teams, applying her process redesign expertise to RFP responses and business process improvement solutions for clients. Brown has also represented DATAMARK as a subject matter expert in numerous webinar presentations, marketing videos, and at industry events and tradeshows. In her new role, Brown will integrate Business Engineering with Sales and Marketing, creating a cohesive structure for business development aligned with technical sales. \n \n\"I'm delighted to be leading our Sales and Marketing teams as DATAMARK moves to add new clients to our BPO and contact center services portfolio,\" Brown said. \"We will continue to build on our reputation as a business service provider that brings together best-fit technology solutions and a talented international workforce that acts with integrity to exceed the expectations of our partners for customer service, quality, timeliness and security.\" \n \nBrown is certified in Action Selling, is an ASQ-certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB) and a certified Project Management Professional (PMP). \n \nAbout DATAMARK \n \nDATAMARK, Inc. is a leading business process outsourcing company specializing in high-volume digital mailroom management, document processing/document management, contact center services, and process improvement consulting for Fortune 500 companies and other large enterprises. \n \nHeadquartered in El Paso, Texas, DATAMARK employs nearly 2,000 people in its U.S., Mexico and India facilities.

Cauliflower-based pizza dough. Chocolate-covered quinoa. Bagel balls stuffed with flavored cream cheese. Vegan, paleo, dairy-free frozen dessert that is a bit hard to describe other than to say it is not ice cream. \n \nNothing says American ingenuity like the eager food entrepreneurs who think their scrumptious concoctions can make it in a culinary landscape that favors big corporations. Last week, 1,400 exhibitors set up shop at the Winter Fancy Food Show in the cavernous Moscone Center here, including some mom-and-pop operations determined to defy the odds. \n \n\"It's possible we do fail,\" said Rachel Geicke, 25, who was there with her business partner, Mariana Ferreira, 23, peddling their non-ice-cream, Snow Monkey. The product, which comes in two flavors, cacao and goji berry, came to market eight weeks ago -- with vast ambitions. \n \nSnow Monkey \"is a vehicle to spark change,\" said Geicke, who met Ferreira when they were undergraduates at Boston University. They describe their fruit-based creation as a \"superfood ice treat, ice cream so good you can have it for breakfast.\" \n \nAs they spooned out samples of Snow Monkey last weekend, one fan jumped and fist-pumped her approval. Now, they only need 100,000 more customers like her. \n \n\"The conventional wisdom would be that up to 90 percent of new packaged food products fail,\" said David Sprinkle, research director of MarketResearch.com and publisher of Packaged Facts . For established brands, he said, the rate is much lower. \n \nIn one part of the convention center, crowds were clotting at the Bantam Bagels booth, where the husband-and-wife team of Nick and Elyse Oleksak were handing out their ping-pong-ball-size toasted bagel balls. The flavors include cinnamon bun, French toast and classic onion. \n \nTheir bagels have that all-important ingredient: authenticity. They are made in Brooklyn with New York water. We \"are trying to be the authentic New York bagel in a different way,\" as Nick Oleksak put it. \n \nBefore they were bagel mavens, Elyse worked in asset management at Morgan Stanley, and Nick was a credit broker for GFI Group, which operates trading marketplaces. The recession convinced them it was time to take control of their own careers. \n \nFor four months the Oleksaks, who knew nothing about baking, made bagels nightly, letting the dough rise in the darkened laundry closet of their Park Slope apartment. \n \nThey appeared on NBC's Today show and in The Wall Street Journal even before they opened their shop on Bleecker Street. \n \n\"We learn as we do,\" Elyse Oleksak said. Six months ago, they reintroduced their bagels to supermarkets; now their bagel balls are in 2,000 stores and 7,500 Starbucks. \n \nListening to these entrepreneurs, they almost sound like politicians. They speak about \"authenticity,\" \"honesty\" and \"transparency.\" \n \nThat message came across in Carol Healy's No-Bake Cookie Co. booth, designed by her husband, Tom, to resemble a 1950s kitchen. Carol Healy's cookies -- in flavors like chocolate mint, peanut butter and coconut macadamia -- are made from her grandmother's recipes. She sold them at her family's market at a gas station in Bend, Ore., before deciding to turn the cookies into a family business. \n \nSeven years ago, the family built a factory in Bend to make what they call \"the only branded natural no-bake cookie out there.\" Their gluten-free cookie tastes like old-fashioned soft fudge, transmitting the message that it is pure, honest and good. It has no four-syllable ingredients. \n \nNot all efforts have succeeded. Early on, the Healys agreed to pay $1,000 and deliver 850 gift boxes to Off the Wall Gifts, a provider of \"celebrity gifting\" for Emmy Award nominees in the news and documentary category.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Clair","zipCode":"62220","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Belleville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belleville News Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659187","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1944"},"name":"Belleville News Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bnd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202703531","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Merced","zipCode":"95340","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Merced","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merced Sun-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Merced Sun-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercedsunstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202706461","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

One of the tallest: building it without undocumented workers. \n \nA labor shortage has left few hands to build houses and factories in the region, where wages have already been rising and projects delayed. Now, the president's plan for \"immediate construction of a border wall\" will force the government to find legal builders for a project that could employ thousands if not tens of thousands. \n \nAbout half of construction workers in Texas are undocumented, and nationwide 14 percent lack authorization for employment in the United States, according to the Workers Defense Project, an Austin, Texas, group that advocates for undocumented laborers. \n \n\"If he is going to build a wall with legal workers in Texas, he is going to have a very hard time,\" said Stan Marek, chief executive officer of Marek Brothers, a Houston commercial builder. \"There is a real shortage of legal labor.\" \n \nThe wall, whose cost has been estimated as high as $25 billion, is shaping up to be one of America's biggest public-works projects since the building of the Hoover Dam during the Great Depression. Trump, who has promised to create jobs by investing more than half a trillion dollars in massive infrastructure projects, will face practical obstacles. While many people think of the border as little more than desert, the almost 2,000-mile terrain includes sand dunes, arroyos and craggy mountains. New roads and temporary concrete plants may have to be built to reach the most desolate areas. \n \n\"Contractors in general throughout the country have been saying it's been difficult to get workers,\" said Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America. \"Getting workers who would be vetted to work on government projects and then getting them to these locations, which are pretty far away, would be among the many challenges in getting this done.\" \n \nCompanies might jump at the wall job, for profit and proximity to the president, and it is always possible to find workers if you pay them enough. Average hourly construction wages are at $28.42 per hour, up 3 percent over the previous year -- the fastest annual increase since 2009, according to Associated General Contractors. Wages for undocumented workers are generally lower, said Simonson, but he didn't have a specific figure. \n \nThe region's construction industry already is in fierce competition with oil and gas producers that can pay much higher than jobs on a construction site. The shortage is so acute that subcontractors already are using unconventional means to find workers. The Central Texas Subcontractor Association is partnering with nonprofit Goodwill Industries to teach skills. Irving, Texas-based Astro Sheet Metal Co. has given up on hiring experienced workers and instead expects to train workers from the ground up. \n \nNationwide, two-thirds of construction firms are having difficulty finding workers, according to an August survey by Associated General Contractors. In Texas, with 1,254 miles of border, 67 percent of builders had trouble finding concrete workers and 63 percent couldn't find enough cement masons, the group found. \n \n\"What happens when an already tight housing industry loses a substantial portion of its labor force to more stringent enforcement of immigration policies, to infrastructure projects, and to possibly build a wall between Mexico and the United States?\" said Mark Boud of San Clemente, Calif., who is chief economist for real-estate research firm Metrostudy. \"Labor shortages and rising labor costs which already plague the housing market will be magnified, and residential construction costs may surge.\" \n \nMarek said his firm, which operates throughout Texas and focuses on interior work, has been turning down jobs because it can't find enough skilled, legal labor. He said a solution would be a guest worker visa program or giving legal status to immigrants already in the country. \n \nMuch has changed for builders since the 18-month Great Recession, which ended in 2009. As unemployment among construction workers topped 27 percent and the housing recovery trailed that of other industries, 2.3 million workers lost their jobs and many left the profession for good. \n \nYounger workers were deterred from entering, and many contractors and subcontractors closed. Combine that shrinking labor market with a booming housing market and you have the perfect recipe for a labor shortage. Unemployment in the construction sector dropped to 4.5 percent over the summer, the lowest level in a decade. \n \nThe number of illegal immigrants in the United States has been falling since the 2008 recession, partly because of the housing crash and loss of construction jobs, and also because of an improving economy in Mexico. There were 11.1 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2014, the most recent data available, according to the Pew Research Center. \n \nThe cohort of unauthorized construction workers declined to 1.2 million in 2012, down 23 percent from five years earlier, Pew said. Central Americans recently fleeing gang violence and seeking asylum in the United States tend to be less skilled in construction than Mexicans. While building a wall is less complex than a skyscraper, it would still take workers with skills in areas such as carpentry, concrete forming and tie wiring. \n \nStill, young people think \"swinging a hammer\" is for unaccomplished people, said Wendy Lambert, executive director of the Central Texas Subcontractor Association, a stereotype she says is unwarranted. She said one of her members, a roofer, has the equivalent of 65 full-time jobs open. \n \n\"Eight to 10 years ago people were beating down their doors looking for jobs,\" she said. \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"LAUREN ETTER AND SHANNON PETTYPIECE BLOOMBERG NEWS"},"topics":[{"name":"Construction news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump's plan to build wall facing labor pinch","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harris","zipCode":"77023","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arkansas Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675615","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6070"},"name":"Arkansas Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arkansasonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202707768","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Otherwise, we would trade FaceTime for face time with Mickey and Minnie, iPads for plunges in the pool and status updates for sunrises from the balcony of our room. \n \nAs it turned out, it was an ideal time to discover the Wonder, which itself had just returned relaxed and rejuvenated from early fall dry dock in Spain \n \nand was eager to show off its recent renovations and enhancements. \n \nBE OUR GUEST \n \nAs we entered the lobby for our cruise, a crew member quietly asked me for our last name, then grandly announced us to the room. My daughters were awestruck by our celebrity-style entrance, then even more awestruck by the name of the group -- the Burger family -- announced after us. \n \nIt was the first in a series of personal touches that made an impression during our trip, from pink robes in each of the girls' sizes hanging in the closet of our stateroom to their favorite drinks waiting each night at our dinner table. \n \nDisney cruises can be more expensive than other lines -- current pricing on disneycruise.disney.go.com starts at $2,900 for a four-night cruise out of Galveston for two adults and two children, about twice a Carnival cruise for the same route -- and like other lines are largely all-inclusive aside from things such as alcoholic beverages, spa treatments and shore excursions. Included in the price, said Melissa Ulrich, owner of the Austin, Texas-based Disney-centered travel agency Trips to the Mouse, who also sailed on the newly renovated ship in November, is a higher level of service than some other lines deliver. \n \n\"I feel like the cast members really know who you are,\" Ulrich said. \"They get to know you, and they also remember you if you come back to the Wonder. They see people all the time, different faces, but they can remember that you like this cuisine and you liked this beverage.\" \n \nA WHOLE NEW WORLD \n \nYou may think you know the movie Toy Story , but until you've climbed 13 huge primary-colored steps to the top of Andy's gigantic bed, then twisted-and-turned your way back down on an enormous slide, you haven't truly experienced it. \n \nThe huge-scale reproduction of Andy's room -- complete with an adult-height Mr. Potato Head -- is one of the new post-dry-dock additions to the Disney Wonder's Oceaneer kids club, which also now includes a life-size re-creation of Wandering Oaken's Trading Post from Frozen , a Club Disney Junior area that features visits from Doc McStuffins and Sofia the First and a Marvel Super Hero Academy. \n \nIn addition to the revamped kids' offerings, our sailing also included the debut of the new Frozen, A Musical Spectacular inside the 977-seat Walt Disney Theatre. I figured the 55-minute show would be little more than an easy way for families to fill an evening hour until I read up on the creative team, which includes a host of Tony Award-winners and -nominees including director Sheryl Kaller and costume designer Paloma Young. \n \n\"This show is loved and revered by so many people, and it's so perfect for a cruise ship insomuch that we have such a wide range of age groups and also boys and girls on board the ship,\" said Jim Urry, vice president of entertainment for Disney Cruise Line, on the day the show debuted. \"This show really does read well to the entire family. It felt like a perfect show for our ship and our demographic.\" \n \nAs the show started, I was surprised to see that it incorporated not only Broadway-style theater but technology and puppetry as well. \n \n\"Should I be looking at the puppet or the singer?\" my 8-year-old whispered as cast members began acting out the roles of young Anna and Elsa using puppets. There were plenty of things that I liked about the show, but seeing the girls react to all of its little details -- from the puppets to the \"snow\" that fell from the ceiling during Elsa's icy blasts -- was my favorite part. \n \n\"I love to watch the children in the audience watching a show for the first time and you see the eyes of the parents realizing the delight on the kid's face,\" Urry said. \"That happens in the dining experiences, in the atrium experiences. Everything on board the ship is for every age group, either by that age group taking part or being observed by the other members of the family. You will never be bored on one of these ships.\" \n \nA SPOONFUL OF SUGAR \n \nWhy watch cartoons during dinner when you can make the cartoons yourself? \n \nAt Animator's Palate, one of the restaurants aboard the Disney Wonder, you won't receive so much as a piece of bread until you and all the members of your group have thoughtfully drawn a character of your choosing on the paper placed in front of your seat. \n \nWe obliged, ordered dinner and kind of forgot about our drawings until a video set to the tune of \"Friend Like Me\" from Aladdin started playing near our table. Featured in the video was each of our characters, brought to life and dancing, marching and even ice skating across the screen with the likes of beloved figures Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio and Snow White. \n \nIn the time it takes to eat a serving of macaroni, we had become bona fide animators -- our names were even featured in the credits. \n \nOne of the things that kept me from wanting to take a cruise was my assumption that mealtime would be filled with forced conversation and bland food, but night after night we received a table to ourselves and enjoyed dinners that were tasty in an atmosphere that was fun. \n \nNo place was more fun than Tiana's Place, which opened for the first time on our sailing and was inspired by 2009's The Princess and the Frog . The restaurant intends to evoke the feel of a New Orleans supper club and mostly succeeds, from the Crawfish Crooners band playing \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" onstage to classic Louisiana cuisine served with just the right amount of kick. But it's the details -- Tiana's family photos and culinary awards framed on the wall, for example -- that really make it feel special. \n \n\"We have a great tradition of taking our Disney stories and making them become a reality in our restaurants. Tiana's Place is exactly that,\" said Ozer Balli, vice president of hotel operations for Disney Cruise Lines. \"Tiana lives in this restaurant. Her dreams come true.\" \n \nFOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER \n \nWhile waiting in line to snap a photo with Minnie, my daughters hit it off with another little girl and became instantly inseparable, begging me to coordinate visits to the kids club with her parents. \n \nWhat did that mean for me? More time than expected to discover the adult spaces of the ship, for one. \n \nOne \"adult district\" features three bars, including the new Crown & Fin English Pub, which, with its dark brown decor, leather seats and brass accents, really was reminiscent of pubs I've visited in London. It also has plenty of TVs for sports fans and fun details for Disney fans. \n \n\"We looked at all of the different stories we've told on film that take place throughout Great Britain and tried to put little props all throughout,\" said Theron Skees, portfolio creative executive for Walt Disney Imagineering. When you enter, for example, keep an eye out for Mary Poppins' umbrella. \n \nI started my afternoon alone with a day pass for the \"rainforest room,\" located next to the just-renovated Senses Spa, where heated chairs and steamy showers provided instant relaxation. Next I went for a soak in the adults-only Quiet Cove hot tub, followed by dinner at Palo, an upscale adults-only Italian restaurant that comes with a dress code and dining upcharge. \n \nAs I sat twisting forkfuls of fat pappardelle topped with succulent lobster and sipping pinot noir while staring out at the ocean, I realized it was the first time in, well, forever that I had enjoyed a relaxed, unplugged evening. The highlight was dessert -- a decadent made-to-order chocolate souffle drenched in vanilla bean and chocolate sauces. \n \nBIBBIDI-BOBBIDI-BOO \n \nGoing into the cruise, I had no expectations, but there really were magical moments sprinkled throughout. \n \nBeing unplugged meant there was no squabbling over the iPad -- although there was a little squabbling over the in-room TV, where channels feature every Disney movie and TV show you could possibly want to watch -- and also more time to pay attention to these moments as they happened. \n \nI savored afternoons like the one we spent at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, a new shop where dresses from all the princesses in Disney's stable hang around the room, creating a rainbow-kaleidoscope wall framed by sparkling accessories. Watching the girls' jaws drop -- not from behind an Instagram filter but up close and personal, every individual piece of glitter twinkling -- as they saw that they had been transformed into Tinker Bell and Princess Jasmine was just as special for me as it was for them. \n \nUnlike my bad mood as I entered the ship, I got off feeling relaxed and happy. \n \nI never thought a brand as pervasive as Disney would inspire me to unplug, but I'm grateful that it did. \n \nTravel on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"KRISTIN FINAN Austin American-Statesman"},"topics":[],"title":"Waves of Wonder","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harris","zipCode":"77023","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arkansas Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675615","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6070"},"name":"Arkansas Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arkansasonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202708283","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:52Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-wonder8_98-22506.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

They later swarmed into the terminal as immigration advocate attorneys tried to access people detained inside. The protesters chanted, \"Let the families out, let the lawyers in.\" \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union announced today that it was taking legal action on behalf of two individuals detained in New York under the order. The ACLU said this evening that an emergency stay had been granted by a federal judge, blocking deportations from the order. The National Council for American Islamic Relations said it would be filing suit on behalf of 20 more individuals on Monday. \n\nTrump's order bans citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the country and blocks any refugees from entering for 120 days.

What we're not clear about is who or what type of families are being held, whether they're from Syria or Iran or other countries, we don't know for certain.\" \n\nAttorney Susie Hwang said there were about a dozen attorneys who arrived at the airport's International Terminal in response to a call from the International Refugee Assistance Project asking attorneys to help immigrants being detained at airports across the country. \n\n\"I'm concerned about the abuse of law and the disregard for the constitution,\" Hwang said of Trump's order. \n\nHwang said several families have been at the airport waiting for several hours to hear word about whether their loved ones will be allowed to leave the airport or returned back to their countries. \n\nAccording to Hwang, one woman had been waiting for hours for her 30-year-old son, who arrived at the airport from Iran early this morning. The woman received asylum in the U.S. six years ago and is hoping her son will as well. \n\n\"Based on his religion, he is being persecuted and is in grave danger if he does go back,\" Hwang said. \n\nThis evening, Hwang said customs officials released one woman from Iran with a Green card after they held and questioned her. \n\nOne person, a San Jose woman who asked not to be identified, stood on the side of the protest with a sign that said, \"I tutor refugees.\" She said she had just started with the program in Los Altos last week and was working with a 60-year-old woman from Iran. \n\n\"She's so eager to learn English,\" she said. \"She's just so passionate about learning.\" \n\n\"As a Christian, I think that what's happening is not acceptable, that's not what Christ was teaching us,\" the woman said. \"And that's why I decided to teach refugees and that's why I'm here today.\" \n\nSFO spokesman Doug Yakel said he was aware of today's protest, but referred any questions about enforcement of the order to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \n\n\"Our goal is to allow for this free speech activity while also ensuring travelers are able to move through the Airport unimpeded,\" Yakel said. \n\nFrank Falcon, a local Customs and Border Protection spokesman, referred questions about local enforcement of the order to the agency's national office, declining to say whether the agency was even enforcing the order in Bay Area airports. \n\nCalls and emails to the national Customs and Border Protection public affairs office were not returned.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Updated: Federal judge blocks immigration order as hundreds protest at airport","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Alameda","zipCode":"94705","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Berkeley","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Berkeley Daily Planet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169790640","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Berkeley Daily Planet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&username=mhomalley"],"sequenceId":"695202708745","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Ying won't be making the traditional pilgrimage back to Shanghai to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday with her extended family. Instead, they're all going to Japan for shopping and sightseeing. \n \nThat new custom lets her family bypass the mobs, clogged roads and subways, lousy customer services -- and boredom -- that can mark holidays at home. During the past few celebrations, Shi and her relatives left China for Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States. \n \n\"The last thing my parents want for the Chinese New Year is a cheerless holiday with the three of us staying home in Shanghai,\" said Shi, 30, who works for a nongovernmental organization in Beijing. \"Going overseas during the Spring Festival costs about the same as going to some domestic tourist spots.\" \n \nThe essence of China's seven-day holiday, also called Spring Festival, is morphing as rising incomes and an expanding network of international flights prompt more people to go abroad -- the equivalent of Americans choosing Bermuda over the Midwest for Thanksgiving. Outbound travel for the holiday break is expected to top a record 6 million passengers, with airlines hauling near-full loads to Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. \n \n\"Chinese New Year is a major international peak for the Chinese airlines,\" said Steve Saxon, a Shanghai-based partner at consultant McKinsey & Co. \"For many, this is one of the only two opportunities to take a long holiday during the year.\" \n \nThe Spring Festival shuts down the world's second-biggest economy for a week as hundreds of millions of factory and office workers leave their adopted homes in Shenzhen or Beijing to reconnect with their ancestral ones, often on the opposite side of the country. Thousands more expatriates return. \n \nThis year's celebration, which began Friday and goes through Thursday, will see the biggest mass migration of people on Earth. More than 414 million Chinese will ride in planes and trains -- as if everyone in the European Union was on the move. \n \nAbout 58.3 million people are expected to fly, representing a 10 percent increase from last year, according to estimates by the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Chinese airlines generate about 20 percent of their revenue during this period, Saxon said. \n \nChinese will travel to 174 destinations outside mainland China for an average of 9.2 days during the holiday period, according to online travel service Ctrip.com International Ltd. \n \n\"Any airline should be able to swim in money during a Chinese traveling holiday,\" said Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. \n \nFueling those excursions is an economy growing annually by at least 6.7 percent since 1990, giving people more money to spend. Disposable income for urban households rose 165 percent from 2006 to 2015, reaching about $4,551, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. \n \nInstead of going back to her hometown in the northeast China forest, Xi Chunhui is going to Macau, Singapore and Hong Kong for 11 days with a friend. \n \n\"The Spring Festival celebration is the same old thing every year at home,\" said Xi, 27, an editor for an internet portal in Beijing. \"I don't think me not being there with them will kill the mood.\" \n \nGoing sightseeing abroad also is a consequence of the government's generations-long policy restricting most families to one child, said Catherine Lim, a Singapore-based analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. A more-affluent younger generation now wants to see the world, she said. \n \n\"When your entire family size shrinks, there really isn't much to do\" at home, Lim said. \"They want to spend more money -- particularly the younger generation -- on experiencing new destinations rather than buying the biggest Hermes bag.\" \n \nChina is the biggest source of overseas travelers in the world, with 128 million people spending $292 billion on their trips in 2015, according to the World Tourism Organization. \n \nThat has been a boon to the nation's airlines, with demand running so high that discounts are ending as many as 50 days before takeoff, according to Ctrip.com. The top-dollar tickets help carriers make up for the massive price cuts offered during slow seasons. \n \nChina Southern Airlines Co., Asia's biggest carrier, added nearly 3,600 flights during this peak travel season -- and expanded services to Australia and New Zealand, the Guangzhou-based airline said. Subsidiary Xiamen Airlines Co. is adding more than 100 flights to Southeast Asia destinations such as Bali and the Maldives, said Hu Nan, a manager for international business. \n \nChina Eastern Airlines Corp., based in Shanghai, added 400 flights starting this month mostly to connect second-tier cities with Okinawa, Japan; Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Thailand; and Cebu, Philippines. \n \n\"All the airlines in China, not just us, are throwing in all resources to brace for the Chinese New Year travel,\" Hu said. \"There is no slack there.\" \n \nOn the destination sides, Japan, Australia and even Israel are rolling out the welcome mats for Chinese tourists by offering multiple-year, multiple-entry visas to Chinese passport holders. The United Arab Emirates is going a step further by offering visas upon arrival, according to state-run Xinhua News Agency. \n \nChinese visitors to Japan jumped 28 percent last year to 6.4 million -- the most from any country, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. \n \nWhen they arrived, they spent $12.8 billion, according to the separate Japan Tourism Agency. Chinese perceive Japanese electronics, luxury items and consumer goods like cosmetics and toothpaste to be of better quality than those made at home. \n \n-- Information for this story was contributed by Kyunghee Park, Chris Cooper and Lee Miller of Bloomberg News. \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Chinese to spend holiday traveling","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harris","zipCode":"77023","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arkansas Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675615","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6070"},"name":"Arkansas Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arkansasonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202709194","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-309281205_1-8_40-22506.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Pins like these, inspired by the popular Audubon bird print series, were all the rage in the 1940s. \n \nBut these particular birds represent much more than a fashion trend. \n \nThese birds were made by inmates at the Rohwer War Relocation Center, a detention facility for Japanese Americans that operated from 1942 to 1945 in Desha County in southeast Arkansas. Now they're a part of the collection at Little Rock's Butler Center for Arkansas Studies and its newest exhibit: \"The American Dream Deferred: Japanese American Incarceration in WWII Arkansas.\" It is the first of four exhibitions about the Japanese internment in Arkansas that will be held at the Butler Center over the next two years. \n \nBecause the inmates couldn't get jewelry in the camp, \"all of these bird pins are made out of scraps,\" says exhibition curator Kim Sanders. \n \nShe points out how the legs were made from wires pulled out of screen doors. \n \nThe art created at Rohwer and at Jerome War Relocation Center in Drew and Chicot counties gives impressive and poignant insight into what the 16,000 inmates' lives were like the years they lived there. \n \nThis is not the first time the Butler Center has had an exhibit on the subject, but this is its largest and most involved effort: a four-part, two-year project that will focus on multiple aspects of the history and cultural significance of the Japanese American experience during World War II. The exhibit exists thanks in large part to a grant from the National Park Service to encourage spreading the story of Rohwer and Jerome. \n \nThe efforts of people like actor George Takei, who lived at Rohwer and the Tule Lake facility in California as a child, have drawn more attention to the story of Japanese Americans' forced relocations, a story that has been \n \nlargely unheard for many years. \n \n\"It's only been in the past couple of decades that this story has gained momentum,\" Sanders says. \"For a while, it was swept under the rug. People didn't talk about it.\" \n \nThe 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor fanned strong anti-Japanese sentiments and fears of further Japanese attacks on the United States. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, ordering the deportation and internment of thousands of people of Japanese descent, most of whom were American citizens and most of whom lived in California, Oregon and Washington state. \n \nMany were gathered in places like the Santa Anita racetrack, where horse stables were converted into \"apartments,\" before the people were loaded on trains and sent to camps. They worked, went to school, took classes, took part in camp government, had clubs and social events, but they were also surrounded by barbed wire and guards and forced away from their homes and livelihoods. \n \n... \n \nThe Butler Center has a large collection of artifacts, particularly from Rohwer, that includes art, furniture, camp school yearbooks, newsletters, posters, circulars, even mundane things such as art supply lists. \n \nMuch of that is due to the foresight and dedication of Mabel \"Jamie\" Jamison Vogel, the art teacher at Rohwer, who saved everything she could think of. When she died, she left her collection to Rosalie Santine Gould, the mayor of McGehee, who eventually donated everything to the Butler Center. \n \nIt was a perfect fit, Butler Center Director David Stricklin says. There are five galleries for displaying art, but also a research room that's open to the general public. \n \n\"You could go up there right now and sit down and read. We're unusual in that respect.\" \n \nAs word has gotten around about the collection, more and more people have donated pieces because, as Stricklin explains, they realize that having such an extensive collection in one place \"attracts people to come learn about it and experience it.\" \n \nOne person who donated works to the collection is Frank Sata (named for President Franklin Roosevelt), whose father, J.T. Sata, was an accomplished and established artist before his incarceration at Jerome. The new exhibit features a few of his paintings of the Jerome camp and one of his sketchbooks. They were some of the last pieces Sata ever did. \n \n\"As a result of the whole experience, he stopped creating art,\" Stricklin says. \"It was so jarring for him he couldn't do it anymore.\" \n \nThe exhibit is organized thematically. Along one wall, there's a timeline that covers the story of the Japanese in America from the 19th century to the 21st, with a heavy emphasis on WWII. The historical data is interspersed with photos and artwork and excerpts from autobiographies by Rohwer high school students who were asked to write about their experiences so far. \n \nThe artwork is divided into sections. There's a section on Vogel, with her portrait and photos of her students posing by the mural they painted on the walls of the camp gym, and displays on Rohwer and Jerome. \n \nThe wall on community focuses on the various activities and interests people had, like a series of fashion sketches. \n \n\"A lot of what the people in the camps tried to make life as normal as possible,\" Stricklin says. \"So some of the young women, especially, they would design dresses because that's what they had been interested in.\" \n \nThey also kept up with more traditional Japanese art like kobu (a process of boiling, removing bark from and polishing cypress knees) and there are a few examples on display. \n \n\"Part of it goes back to this Japanese aesthetic of loving natural forms, simple things and things that are imperfect,\" Sanders says. \n \nNearby, the identity wall has sketches and paintings that represent the cultural duality these people felt -- the pull between their dedication to and love for America and the pride and strength of their Japanese heritage. \n \n\"For a lot of them, it was a real struggle with their identity,\" Sanders says. \"You can be 100 percent American and have a different heritage. We know that now, but back then that was a different story.\" \n \nThat duality also comes into stark relief in the wall of patriotic posters, all painted in the camp and all looking very much like posters that could be found all over the country. Calls to \"Keep Them Flying\" or to buy war bonds. Despite the fact that they were called \"resident non-aliens\" instead of \"citizens\" and that they had been taken from their homes, many of them were still very patriotic. \n \nSanders says, \"It's no different in these camps, even though they were rounded up by the very government they're trying to support, they still want to show they're loyal Americans so they were going to do their part for the war effort.\" \n \nAbout 800 Rohwer camp inmates ended up serving in the 442nd combat team in Europe, which may have been the most highly decorated military unit in the war. \n \n\"Their attitude was, I think, the faster the war ends, the faster we can go back to California,\" Stricklin says. \n \nThe residents had access to ample amounts of wood, since Japanese American labor was used to clear the swamps for farmland. \n \nMuch of that wood was used to make furniture. The government provided inmates with a pot-bellied stove, a cot and a mattress. To make their little barrack apartments less stark, residents made their own furniture, built front porches, added gardens and gazebos. The exhibit includes a chair, table and screen made from pieces of scrap wood. \n \nWhile Sata's paintings and some other pieces are obviously by skilled, highly trained artists, Sanders says, \"Most of the work that we have here is by people who had never done art before.\" \n \nArt classes were very popular at the camps with adults and children and while they did have some art supplies to work with and they could order fabric to make clothes, they also created art out of whatever they could find -- like making carefully sewn necklaces out of metal buttons. \n \n\"The ingenuity in this whole collection -- the whole experience is just incredible,\" Sanders says. \"It's a testament to how humans can endure. They usually turn to art for endurance. It gives them some sort of control, I think, over their surroundings when they have little control otherwise.\" \n \n... \n \nThis particular exhibit will continue at the Butler Center through June 24, but there will be three more. In the fall, there will be an exhibit of photographs by Paul Faris, who was invited to the camp to photograph the residents. \n \nPart three, in winter/spring 2018, will focus on the experiences of the camp high school students, giving more details from the students' autobiographies, artworks and yearbooks. \n \nThe final part, in later 2018, will be on camp portraits. \n \nThe current exhibit will stay in a state of flux. \n \n\"Things are going to change,\" says co-curator Colin Thompson. \"What you see here is just the beginning.\" \n \nThey plan to continue to add more pieces of artwork from the permanent collection, so Thompson promises there will be different things to see as weeks go by. \n \nThe national attention drawn to the story of Japanese Americans in WWII has increased over the years, and so has interest in the Butler Center's collection. \n \nTakei has come to visit and explore the art and documents. While they have not interviewed him, they have started collecting interviews with other former inmates, their families and the relatives of people who worked at the camps. And they have hopes for starting new research projects based on the documents and works in the collection. \n \nBut it's still a subject many people don't know about. Even if they do know about the internment camps in general, there are still many who don't realize there were two in Arkansas. That's what the exhibit hopes to correct: to let people know what happened in southeast Arkansas and to link past and present. \n \n\"Part of what I've tried to do here was try to relate it to people today,\" Sanders says. \"I try to drive it home that it's really up to us to reshape society so something like this doesn't happen again.\" \n \nThat connection between past and present comes through in the first-person accounts of the students, or in a young woman's sketches designing her dream formal gown -- one that looks much like a dress from Gone With the Wind . It's a world away, but also so very normal. \n \n\"I want them to know that just because it's history doesn't mean it can't happen again,\" Sanders says. \"History is a living, breathing thing. It's not just over. It's something we make happen every day.\" \n \nThompson agrees. \n \n\"It's a tremendous story. A very moving story. When you meet people who were in the camps and you see, this isn't just a random fact. These were real people that were in these camps in Arkansas. I think it's something people should know about.\" \n \nStyle on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Art from broken hearts","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harris","zipCode":"77023","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arkansas Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675615","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6070"},"name":"Arkansas Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arkansasonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202710661","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/28/Butler_center_art.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 50 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Palm Beach","zipCode":"33410","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Palm Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WPBF","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"name":"WPBF","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wpbf.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202711739","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And their company, Assemblage Art & Craft Manufacturing, shows no signs of slowing down. \n \nAfter Chanel asked whether it was possible to replicate a piece of fabric in wallpaper form in 2004, Christian Batteau, 42, set to work trying to find a way to do it. The Los Angeles-native studied sculpture and spent time working for contemporary artist Jeff Koons but said he has been working with plaster and painting \"to support my sculpture hobby\" since age 17. \n \nMost handmade wallpaper is applied directly to the wall, which requires paying expensive crews for weeks to install on-site. With that process it is also impossible to produce the kinds of designs like the Batteaus now make, because gravity causes them to drip. \n \nHe tweaked paint formulas and experimented with different kinds of paper until he found the perfect formula that would be able to handle heavy products like layers of marble dust plaster, precious metals, beeswax and lacquer and not crack when rolled up for transport. \n \nThey eventually ended up with the perfect recipe that has allowed the Batteaus' business to take off on a global scale. Unlike traditional bespoke -- or made-to-order -- wallpaper, their product can be shipped anywhere and takes just a day to put up. \n \nTheir adopted home in Arkansas has made the business and their current lives possible, they said. \"We could not be doing this in New York,\" said Heidi Batteau, 35. \n \n\"It's a competitive industry, and we would have to charge more to pay our artists a livable wage. If somebody is coming to work for us on contract, it's got to be worth it for them to be flexible with the production schedule. In New York we were paying people $20-$25 an hour. The profit margin was low, and you can't even live well on that wage in the city.\" \n \nThey have had two children since they moved, something they say they couldn't find a way to do in New York, given the costs and space constraints. \n \nBatteau grew up in Witter, an unincorporated community in Madison County. Her mother, Betty Blackwood, still owns and operates a hand-crafted textile company, Dogwood Designs, in Witter. \n \n\"I knew there was a large craft movement here. There are a lot of people here supporting themselves by making things,\" Batteau said. \"You see that and think, OK, we can do this. We can go out there and make a living.\" \n \n\"Although,\" she qualified, \"it was a lot scarier once we actually got here.\" \n \nWhile their best year so far has yielded $850,000 in revenue, it took time to see numbers like that. \n \n\"Brand equity is way harder to generate than I realized,\" Christian Batteau said. \"When you have a new brand, big architecture firms are reticent to place purchases from you, because they're trying to see whether you survive.\" \n \n\"We had to wait that out. It took two years. And in the meantime, we were doing anything to make a living,\" he said. \"I was chopping wood on the side to pay the people working for us.\" \n \n\"You constantly wonder, should we just say it's done and go back?\" Heidi Batteau recalled. \"But you've got to try and keep your positive attitude.\" \n \nAs to why he stuck it out, Christian Batteau said, \"I believed in the dream. It sounds ridiculous. But I believed in being able to have our sustainable life, grow our own food, hire people for a livable wage and make beautiful work.\" \n \nRecently, with help from international sales representation, the Batteaus' business has expanded beyond exclusively custom orders to existing designs people order specifically. \"It has made the business steadier,\" Heidi Batteau said. \n \nAnother component of their customer service is \"value engineering,\" Christian Batteau said. \"By removing some of the more expensive layers like marble dust plaster, someone like Banana Republic can afford to buy a design, instead of just a Chanel,\" he said. \n \n\"We are an art studio,\" Heidi Batteau said. \"We'll do anything. If someone comes to us and says, 'Can you do it?' We will do it.\" \n \nTheir flexibility and willingness to customize has proved one of their strongest selling points. They have taken things like fabrics, tortoiseshell and leathers and interpreted them into complex wallpaper design, and they have taken complicated and expensive designs down a notch for smaller budgets. \n \n\"They're so approachable even though they're producing this really beautiful, luxurious art,\" said Nancy Winston, general manager for the Texas showrooms of Holly Hunt, a company that designs and manufacturers home furnishings and also represents Assemblage. \n \n\"They've done installations for the likes of Louis Vuitton, but you can create your own little jewel in your powder room or bathroom. For example, they use a lot of precious metals, but there are alternatives if budgets don't allow for that.\" \n \n\"Assemblage is one of my favorites to work with because they are so hands-on and passionate,\" she said. \"It makes it fun. You can feel how committed and detail-oriented they are, and you just know it's going to work for a client. Mistakes don't happen, because they are so detail-oriented.\" \n \nThere are almost no other businesses around the world producing work like the Batteaus. Most wallpaper is printed nowadays. Christian Batteau said that even when he tried to outsource orders when it was particularly busy, he could not find a competitor willing to do the same work at the same price. \n \n\"It's a lost craft,\" he said. \n \nThe more the Batteaus are doing this, the more orders they have received -- more than 400 as of now.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 50 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72904","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"4029 TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"195"},"name":"4029 TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.4029tv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202713970","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 51 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202717547","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That follows hard on the heels of an announcement from Nokia, which teased the Chinese launch of its new Nokia 6 phone ahead of a larger Feb. 26 launch event. \n \nNokia? BlackBerry? What's next, the return of Baby-G watches? It may all feel a bit 2002 seeing these phone brands come back into the spotlight, but here's the thing: These are not the phone brands that you think they are. Both of the new smartphones are made by different companies than the ones we knew and loved, as a result of complicated licensing agreements. \n \nThe company you know as BlackBerry -- Canadian, security-conscious -- is focusing its efforts on software to augment smartphones and its auto efforts via QNX -- a part of the firm that makes smart dashboard software and has its own self-driving car prototype. While BlackBerry designed the Mercury in-house, it and all other BlackBerry phones will be made and sold by Chinese tech giant TCL. \n \nAnd Nokia is no longer the company that rose to prominence with its old feature phones, though it still makes telecom equipment and other consumer gadgets. But since Microsoft sold Nokia off, the rights to make Nokia-branded phones belong to HMD, another Chinese tech company. \n \nBoth firms are trying to make a bigger mark in a global smartphone market that's still largely dominated by Apple and Samsung. Picking up a well-known -- if slightly dusty -- brand from the earlier days of mobile phones is one way to do that. \n \nBut don't expect exactly the same experience that you had before. Both phones also represent a capitulation of sorts to Google. BlackBerry and Nokia held out for a while using non-Android operating systems for years. (Nokia and BlackBerry each had their own systems for a while. Nokia also moved to Windows Phone while it was owned by Microsoft.) Both failed, in part because they couldn't keep up with the app selection from Apple and Google, as most developers were only interested in making programs for those two platforms. With both phones now using Android, that won't be an issue anymore. \n \nOf course, consumers will have to hear more details about these phones before we can judge whether either comeback will work. The success or failure of a phone depends more on its features, price and value than on whether it gives you warm fuzzies by reminding you of tech days gone by. But if you're looking to rock a little retro this year, this could be one way to do it.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Telecom news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Handhelds news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"European business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"What's behind the return of BlackBerry and Nokia phones?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60006","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469483376","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dhbusinessledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202717992","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It sort of sounds like a satirical piece -- it did, in fact, end up in Reddit's \"Not the Onion\" subsection -- but the suggestion really does come from the French regulator, RTE. \n \nWhich got us thinking: How do our tech habits affect how much power we use and the environment? Finding an answer is harder than you may think. After all, the energy you use at your desk writing a typical email isn't all the energy that an email uses. As the French warning indicates, there's a whole infrastructure behind every message, which includes not only the electricity you use but also the energy it takes to store and transmit that information through data centers. \n \nMany researchers have looked into the carbon footprint of these types of technology -- meaning the amount of greenhouse gas produced to support the activity -- to measure the impact they have on the environment. This is commonly expressed in the volume of carbon dioxide. Using more energy tends to produce a larger greenhouse gas emission, but using alternative forms of energy that don't burn greenhouse gasses can also reduce a technology's carbon footprint. \n \nThe carbon footprint of activities depend heavily on which companies you use, as different companies source their energy in different ways. Greenpeace and other environmental activists have long encouraged consumers to think about the environmental effects of their tech use. \n \nWorking off these and other sources, we were able to come up with some rough estimates about how your tech habits affect the environment. Your ultimate impact will, of course, depend on the way you power your own home -- solar, wind, etc. \n \n\u2022 Email: The average spam email has a footprint equivalent to 0.3 g of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e), according to carbon footprint expert Mike Berners-Lee's 2010 book \"How Bad are Bananas: The Carbon Footprint of Everything.\" A normal email, according to that book, has a footprint of 4 g of CO2e, which accounts for the power data centers and computers spend sending, filtering and reading messages. An email with a \"long and tiresome attachment\" can have a carbon footprint of 50g CO2e. \n \nBerners-Lee estimates that a typical year of incoming mail adds 300 lbs. of emissions to a person's carbon footprint, or the equivalent of \"driving 200 miles in an average car.\" \n \nOn a larger scale, he says that the world's data centers in 2010 accounted for 130 million tons of CO2e, or a quarter of a percent of the world's global total. Berners-Lee projected that the world's data centers will produce 250 to 340 million tons CO2e by 2020. \n \n\u2022 An hour of streaming video: Netflix itself said that, in 2014, that the average customer had a carbon footprint of 300g per year. Though, it must be said, that didn't factor in the power consumed by devices -- just the energy used delivering the service itself. \n \nNetflix has since made its service carbon neutral, including the power it uses through Amazon Web Services and its own Open Connect program. Greenpeace did give Netflix a D in its annual report of tech companies environmental practices. The report that the firm has attained some of its carbon neutrality by buying offsets rather than encouraging its cloud providers to switch to cleaner energy source. That includes Amazon Web Services, which earned a C in the same report. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) \n \n\u2022 Watching television: The power consumption, and therefore the carbon footprint, of your television obviously depends quite a bit on what kind of television you have. If you want to find your own television's consumption, try heading to the EnergyStar website, which will let you find products that have been certified as energy-efficient and give you their consumption information. \n \nAgain referring to Berner-Lee's book, an hour of television viewing on an old 32-inch CRT television was rated at 84g CO2e for an hour's worth of watching television, while a 15-inch LCD television generated 37 g. A 42-inch plasma television, however, generate the most with 240g CO2e. \n \n\u2022 Playing video games: Game consoles can be power hogs, at least according to a 2014 report from the Natural Resources Defense Council. As the NRDC put it: \"As of January 18, 2014, just two months after their release, 8 million PS4 and Xbox One consoles had already been sold globally. Just these two months' worth of sales will consume 8,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity and be responsible for the emissions of 3 million metric tons of CO2 over the life of the consoles.\" \n \nGame consoles are often put into a standby mode instead of being completely turned off, which contributes to the power they draw. Overall, the NRDC estimated at the time that game consoles drew as much electricity each year as the city of Houston. The study has not been repeated with the newest consoles each company has announced last year. Since the study, however, Microsoft introduced a new power-saving mode designed to reduce how much power it guzzles. \n \n\u2022 Streaming music: Here, again, the numbers are fuzzy -- so fuzzy, in fact, that numbers were hard to come by at all. But a 2013 article cited in The Washington Post estimated that streaming an album 27 times used up the same amount of energy as producing and shipping a CD. So if you're wondering whether streaming a song is better for the environment than buying it on CD, the devil is in the details. \n \nIn all cases, the question of how harmful any given activity's energy use may depend in part on the company you're using. Several companies, including Apple, Google and Netflix, have all committed to using clean sources of energy for their data centers -- and, in many cases, are increasing the percentage of clean energy they're using for their services each year. \n \nIf you're worried about your energy bill, then paying attention to consumption alone is probably what you need to pay attention to the most. If you're concerned about your carbon footprint, then researching how the companies you use source energy is also worth a look.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Digital distribution news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"How bad are email, streaming, gaming for the environment?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60006","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469483376","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dhbusinessledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202718183","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The film secured six Oscar nominations in all, including ones for acting, writing and directing. \n \nWhile Netflix, the streaming leader with almost 94 million subscribers worldwide, has upended entertainment industry traditions, Amazon.com has played more by Hollywood's rules. In the movie business, that means giving motion pictures a serious run in theaters, rather than releasing them simultaneously online, as Netflix often does. \n \n\"They would both like Oscar glory, all the studios do,\" said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co., an industry researcher. \n \nWhen Amazon buys a movie, Bock said, it comes with the vow the film will have a long run in theaters before showing up on the company's video service, a concession to directors and others who make their movies with big screens in mind. That means at least a month, the company has said. \n \n\"That isn't the case with Netflix right now,\" Bock said. \n \nSeattle-based Amazon acquired \"Manchester by the Sea\" for $10 million a year ago at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The film stars Casey Affleck as a janitor who returns to his hometown to look after his nephew following the death of his brother. But he struggles to cope with his own tragedy. Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges are nominated for their supporting roles, while Kenneth Lonergan was nominated for his directing and writing. Roadside Attractions distributed the movie in U.S. theaters. \n \nThe world's largest online retailer, Amazon uses movies and TV shows to attract and keep customers. Its Prime members, who pay $99 a year for delivery discounts and media streaming, are more likely to stick around on the site and spend more than those who don't subscribe. Video watchers are also more inclined to renew their prime memberships. \n \nIn April, Amazon introduced a stand-alone Prime Video service featuring on-demand access to thousands of movies and Amazon originals for $8.99 a month. In all, Prime had about 65 million members in the U.S. at the end of September, up 38 percent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago, which surveys Amazon shoppers. \n \nAmazon's embrace by the movie industry stands in contrast to its years of feuding with book publishers and authors, who maintained that the company's low prices have undermined their industry. Most recently, that's been with electronic books priced far below printed material. \n \nNetflix is the world's largest paid video service. The streaming pioneer, the Los Gatos, California-based company spent $6 billion on TV shows and movies last year, and has won both Emmys and Academy Awards, including Oscars for best documentary. This year, the company earned an Oscar nomination for the documentary \"13th,\" which investigates the high rate of incarceration in the U.S., particularly among African Americans. Amazon spent $3 billion, according to estimates from Cowen & Co. \n \nNetflix also just registered its best quarter ever. The company added 7 million subscribers in the final three months of 2016 and 19 million for the year. \n \nMoreover, one Hollywood agent who sells films says the two services are picking movies that target different audiences, with Amazon aiming for shoppers who want more artistic fare. Amazon's promise of a theatrical run attracts makes the service more appealing to some of those filmmakers. \n \n\"They've been a great partner to the exhibition industry,\" said Ken Thewes, chief marketing officer at Regal Entertainment Group, the No. 2 U.S. theater chain. \"They absolutely have a different approach than Netflix. They have really respected the windows and we respect that.\" \n \nRegal has teamed up with Amazon on a $35 movie pass to show all the best picture nominees at theaters ahead of the Feb. 26 Academy Awards ceremony. At last year's annual exhibitor convention, CinemaCon, Amazon presented its upcoming slate just like a major Hollywood studio. In one year, the company released 15 films, as many as Paramount Pictures. \n \nNetflix wants to change the old model -- and show movies online to customers at the same time they're in theaters. With a growing global subscriber base, the company has financed a lot of films it says are popular that never had a shot at awards (or good reviews), like comedies starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. \n \nRich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, said it's too soon to say whether one or the other has come out on top in feature films. Both companies have been spending on feature films at this year's Sundance festival, and Netflix has invested large sums in new movie projects including Brad Pitt's \"War Machine\" and a Will Smith picture called \"Bright.\" \n \n\"Let's see what happens when Netflix rolls out some of its far larger films bets later this year into next,\" Greenfield said. \"It's still early.\" \n \n--- \n \nBloomberg's Lucas Shaw and Spencer Soper contributed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Movie business news","group":"Media"},{"name":"E-commerce news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Digital distribution news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Amazon steals Netflix's spotlight with Oscar nomination","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60006","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469483376","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dhbusinessledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202718395","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Instead of updating investors on its projected market valuation, AppDynamics was the subject of a different announcement: It had agreed to be acquired by Cisco Systems Inc. for $3.7 billion. \n \nThe deal is seen by some advisers as the first in a long-expected wave of unicorn buyouts. With more than 150 companies valued at more than $1 billion and a temperamental IPO market, being acquired offers startups an exit from the funding roller coaster and can also shield them from the regulatory and investor scrutiny that comes with a public listing. At the same time, it can create the risk that the startup loses its culture, independence and key staffers when folded into a larger business. \n \nWhile dual-track processes -- when a company pursues both an IPO and gauges buyer interest -- are common, people with knowledge of the industry say AppDynamics' 11th-hour deal is the closest to listing day that they've seen a tech company get before selling instead. \n \nA representative for Cisco declined to comment on the details of the deal, while representatives for AppDynamics didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \nBankers working on AppDynamics' initial public offering were kept in the dark until moments before the official release, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the details aren't public. The roadshow for the IPO had been going well, and underwriters even thought the deal could end up oversubscribed, meaning investors wanted more shares. \n \nThey had already decided to increase the marketed price range to $12 to $14 per share from $10 to $12 apiece, which would give the company a market value of about $1.72 billion at the top of the range. \n \nBut behind the scenes, the company had tapped boutique advisory firm Qatalyst Partners to run a sale. AppDynamics deliberately chose an adviser with no links to its IPO underwriters to avoid any information about the potential deal leaking, the people said. \n \nA representative for Qatalyst didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \nMeetings with Cisco and its advisers took place late at night in hotel rooms during the IPO roadshow, and only after underwriters and investors had gone home, they said. \n \nCisco, based in San Jose, had been on the scene for months, initially holding discussions with AppDynamics about potential partnerships between the two companies, the people said. It's a common move for software makers, which can team up and integrate certain services to jointly sell their products. Over the course of discussions, the people said, Cisco realized it wanted tighter integration: That meant making a knockout offer.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Communications equipment news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Cisco Systems news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Could Cisco's 11th-hour AppDynamics deal pave the way for unicorn buyouts?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60006","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469483376","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dhbusinessledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202718644","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But, as many outlets have reported over the past couple of days, the people operating his administration's Twitter accounts may not be using all their security options to the fullest. As CNN reported, a hacker specifically wrote to the president with tips on how to lock hackers out of his official Twitter account. \n \nAlthough your own Twitter account may not be as sought-after as the president's, the hubbub over the security of the White House's accounts is a good reminder for all Twitter users to take a spin through their settings. Below are some tips. \n \n\u2022 Require personal information to reset your password: This is the main tip that hacker WauchulaGhost recommended to the Trump Twitter team. It's also a tip that Twitter itself recommends in every password reset email. In Twitter settings, there's an option to require someone to put in a phone number or email address before they see your redacted password. \n \n\u2022 Verify your log-in requests: Look at the accompanying screenshot, and you'll see an option to \"verify login requests,\" which is Twitter's way of trying to de-jargonize the phrase \"two-factor authentication.\" Using two-factor authentication means signing in with a special code in addition to your password. The code can come via text, a login notification on your phone or by using an authentication mobile app that will automatically generate codes for you. Doing any of those things makes your account harder to hack, since it requires someone to both know your password and have access to your phone or text messages. \n \nYes, it's a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. \n \nAlso, if you receive your codes by text, don't reply to them. As my colleague Abby Ohlheiser reported, doing so will post whatever you reply straight to Twitter. Some theorize that this is how White House press secretary Sean Spicer ended up sending two apparently nonsensical eight-letter strings to his account two days in a row -- though the White House's official response is that both messages were a \"pocket tweet.\" \n \n\u2022 Use an email address that doesn't have your name attached to it: If you really don't want to use two-factor authentication, then do your best to register your Twitter account using an email address that isn't easy to guess. Why? If someone is trying to hack into your Twitter account, the first thing they'll probably do is try to figure out your email address, via the \"Forgot Password?\" link that shows a redacted version of your email address. \n \nIf your name is John Doe and your email address shows up as jd***@gmail.com, it's probably going to be pretty easy for a hacker to fill in the blanks. In fact, that's exactly what WauchulaGhost did with the @VP account. Per the CNN report: He said the email associated with Vice President Mike Pence was easy to guess once you saw the redacted version: vi***************@gmail.com, which WauchulaGhost pieced together as vicepresident2017@gmail.com. \n \n--- \n \nThe @VP account is no longer linked to a Gmail account. Nor is the @POTUS Twitter account, which was also tied to a personal Gmail account -- an address the Hill and others say appears to have belonged to White House director of social media Dan Scavino. That's not illegal -- though many companies and agencies have policies against using personal accounts for professional Twitter accounts. It's also arguably pretty insecure, depending on the security settings enabled on Gmail. \n \nSince that news broke, the account has been changed to link to two different accounts, which appear to have the government \"who.eop.gov\" domain. As of time of writing, it still did not have the personal information requirement enabled. \n \nThis tip won't always work, though.

Classie Brigade was one of the country's best three year olds but his attempts to get one up on Lazarus, such as when second to the champion in both the Flying Stakes and the Derby, were always denied. \n \nClassie Brigade was driven by Blair Orange who is making a habit of winning Invercargill Cups. In the past three years he's won on Saveapatrol (2014) and Johnny Fox (2015) and in earlier years on Highview Tommy ( 2011) Harnetts Creek (2004) and The Tough Nut (2000). \n   \nClassie Brigade, driven by Blair Orange, left, led by Tracee Sherborne, after winning the 2017 Invercargill Trotting Cup at the Ascot Park Racehorse. \n   \n\"Its good when you get on the right horses,\" Orange said. \n \nClassie Brigade started from 30m behind and Orange settled him back in the running. He was well aware of the strong pace but said his charge handled it well. About 600 metres from home, Orange asked the four year old to improve and he quickly got up beside the pacemaking Captain Dolmio. He had a fight on his hands though and only got clear close to home. \n \n\"When we got out and sprinted he felt good, he began to pull up when he got to the front but kept fighting,\" Orange said. \n \nClassie Brigade, who finished second in last year's Southland Supremacy Stakes, had half a length to spare at the finish. \n \nThe group three win was a fitting reward for McGrath who lined up three in the feature, all of them stallions. Maverick and Matthew Williamson ran home well for third after breaking early. McGrath was sixth on Ears Burning who pulled a flat tyre for most of the race.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MAC HENRY"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Driver Blair Orange continues Invercargill Trotting Cup habit with Classie Brigade victory","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Stuff.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Stuff.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202719160","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:47:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's created pileups at Starbucks and frustrated some customers enough that they've canceled their orders, said Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. \n \n\"The use of mobile order and pay continues to accelerate,\" Johnson said in an interview. \"That's created congestion at the handoff.\" \n \nThe snags hurt U.S. sales in the first quarter, contributing to disappointing results for the world's largest coffee chain. But the company has been working to correct the problem, Johnson said. \n \nThe stakes of getting the process right are high for Starbucks, which now generates 27 percent of its U.S. sales via mobile payments. The company is counting on the system to help attract customers and speed them through its stores. Johnson, a veteran of Microsoft and Juniper Networks, is ascending to the chief executive officer job in April -- a move seen as solidifying Starbucks' tech ambitions. \n \nStarbucks also cited a broader restaurant slump for creating a \"challenging environment\" last quarter. The company reined in its forecast for the full year, saying revenue will rise between 8 percent and 10 percent. It had previously predicted a double-digit increase. \n \nThe stock fell as much as 4.8 percent to $55.65 in New York on Friday after the results were released. Before the drop, Starbucks' shares had increased 5.3 percent this year, outpacing the 2.6 percent gain of the S&P 500 Index. \n \nJohnson is taking the reins from Howard Schultz, who served two stints as CEO and built Starbucks into a global coffee empire. Johnson inherits a company with \"outsized expectations\" for performance, said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Against that backdrop, the company's 3 percent same-store sales growth last quarter wasn't good enough. \n \n\"In the realm of restaurants in general, 3 percent is not a bad result,\" she said. \"But Starbucks is considered more of a premium brand. There was an expectation that they would be slightly higher.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Beverages industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Retail industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Starbucks news","group":"Companies"}],"title":"Downside to Starbucks mobile orders?

And although first-time buyers' incomes have not changed significantly, the median price of their first home has increased by about a quarter. \n \n\"Over the last 20 years, home values in the metro areas with the most social mobility have soared, making it difficult for low-income people to afford living in the very places where they could most easily achieve socio-economic growth. \n \n\"Nationwide, the bottom third income earners spend twice as much of their income on mortgage payments than the top third.\" \n \nIn some expensive markets, the report pointed out, those making incomes in the bottom third would have to spend more than half of that income to afford the monthly payment on the cheapest homes on the market. \n \nQ. Why are young couples (millennials) so active as homebuyers? \n \nA. One reason might be that they are producing more offspring and feel the need of being settled in a home of their own. \n \n\"Millennial motherhood is on the rise. Could the increase in births for the millennial generation bode well for real estate and finally convince them to move into homeownership?\" \n \nThat question was asked in a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. \n \n\"About 1.3 million millennial-aged women gave birth in 2015, which accounts for 82 percent of all U.S. births that year, according to Pew Research center data. Millennial women have lagged other generations in birthrates. \n \n\"Nearly half of Generation X women were already into motherhood by the time they were in the 18-to-33 age range, which millennials are at now.\" \n \nQ. What are predictions for commercial mortgages this year? \n \nA. Commercial and multifamily mortgage lending is expected to increase in 2017, as lenders' appetites to place new loans and borrowers' appetites to borrow both remain strong, according to a new Mortgage Bankers Association survey. \n \n\"Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of the top firms expect originations to increase in 2017, with one-quarter (26 percent) expecting an increase of 5 percent or more. A full half (50 percent) expect their own firm's originations to increase by 5 percent or more,\" it was noted in a recent report. \n \n\"Commercial mortgage bankers expect 2017 to carry-over much of the momentum from 2016,\" said Jamie Woodwell, MBA's vice president for commercial real estate research. \n \n\u2022 Email Jim Woodard at storyjim@aol.com. \n \n© 2017, Creators Syndicate","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Gaps surface in national housing market","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60006","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469483376","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dhbusinessledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202720263","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But a new cable company in town is teasing a very different experience. Instead of a corporate truck, what you might see at the curb is a BMW, or perhaps a Tesla. \n \nRunning on futuristic electric batteries rather than gasoline, the luxury vehicles reflect the kind of business Layer3 wants to be: An upscale, next-gen TV provider. But the way the company is going about it may not be what you expect. It is betting big on an old-school approach, one where the traditional, fat cable bundle is king and the customers are TV die-hards who don't buy into the newfangled streaming services flooding the market. \n \nAt a time when Americans are increasingly abandoning their cable companies -- flocking to alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu -- Layer3's premise is that the big bundle of basic and premium channels that has sustained the industry for decades is still a viable formula. \n \n\"We're the first cable company in ... 10 years to come that's brand new,\" said Jeff Binder, Layer3's chief executive. \"Consumers haven't had a young innovative company to provide [pay-TV] services to them since the mid-1990s, when Dish and DirectTV came on the scene.\" \n \nThat notion flies in the face of moves by major players -- AT&T, HBO, CBS -- that believe major industry change is afoot. These companies have embraced online streaming in a big way, launching flashy stand-alone apps that deliver content over the internet and to mobile devices in a bid to compete with Netflix. Some, such as AT&T, estimate there could be 20 million U.S. households to win over that don't currently subscribe to cable. \n \nFor mainstream TV firms, the right response to streaming is to start swimming with the tide. Layer3's first instinct is to swim in the other direction. \n \nAfter several pilot projects in Texas and Illinois, Layer3 launched last summer in the District of Columbia -- its first official market -- and it plans to expand into most major U.S. cities over the next two years. The company's standard package costs $79 a month and gives you about 150 channels as well as trial subscriptions to HBO and Epix; and optional add-ons include Showtime, Cinemax and Spanish-language content. The vast majority of Layer3's 250-channel lineup comes in high definition. \n \nIn interviews, executives declined to say how many customers have signed up. But they predict there may be as many as 35 million current cable subscribers who will not be lured away by online substitutes such as Dish's SlingTV or DirecTV Now, the new streaming service from AT&T. \n \nBut if the industry's biggest players think streaming is the future, what makes Layer3 think it can survive for the long haul? \n \nOne way of answering this is by looking not at how many households are cutting the cord every year, but at how much they earn. It turns out that the most avid cord-cutters among us tend to be lower-income Americans. Does your household make $75,000 a year or more? You're more likely to have stuck with your cable company than if your annual income is below $20,000. \n \nThose findings from the Pew Research Center may sound familiar to those who've canceled their subscriptions because of rising bills. For many Americans, cable is just too expensive. But Layer3 is more interested in the other folks -- the more affluent households that absolutely need their pay-TV and are still willing to shell out for it. This market may shrink as cord-cutting grows. But it's still enormous, and it's where Layer3 hopes to find its niche. \n \n\"It is certainly a counterintuitive strategy,\" said Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at MoffettNathanson. \"Theirs will be a high cost, and therefore high priced, alternative to a service that many believe is already too expensive. There's a premium segment in any market, but what remains to be seen is whether they can capture enough of that premium segment.\" \n \nTo help court those high-end customers, Layer3 is trying to improve on the reputation many cable providers have gained as stodgy, hulking corporations trying to nickel-and-dime their customers. It isn't just rolling out red-carpet customer service in the form of fancy cars or a \"white-glove\" customer experience, such as your ability to text the company whenever you have questions or concerns. It's also trying to lure subscribers with the promise of next-gen technology embedded in its product. \n \nLayer3's wireless set-top box supports 4K-resolution video. It offers a curated feed that automatically learns what you like to watch, and it has integration with Facebook and Twitter, along with a few other bells and whistles. Behind the scenes, the company manages a large backbone network that can pipe content all across the country; by year's end, Layer3 will control about 24,000 miles of fiber optic cable. \n \nAll of this is aimed at raising the bar for cable service, making it so that consumers feel they're actually getting what they pay for -- or more. \n \n\"It's no different than comparing an HTC to an Apple,\" Binder said. \"I think we can out-innovate. I think we can have a much better customer-relationship environment.\" \n \nBinder is fond of drawing the Apple parallel. He does it often, which is little surprise: The iPhone-maker's reputation for ease-of-use, strong design chops and a history as a technological disruptor provides much for Layer3 to emulate. \n \nThe analogy is appropriate in other ways, too. Apple's products are largely viewed as status symbols, particularly among the rich. Whether by hiring former Burberry executives or launching a $17,000 smartwatch, Apple has all but begged analysts to label the tech company a successful luxury brand. \n \nThere's money to be made at the high-end of the market, and Layer3 is figuring that out, just as Apple has. \n \nBut there's a major difference between the two companies: Whereas Apple earns incredible margins on the iPhone thanks to the relatively low cost of producing one, analysts say being a cable company of Layer3's size comes with steep fixed costs. \n \nThose costs include what cable companies pay to various programmers and channels to carry their content. These rights fees can reach as high as $7 per subscriber per month, in the case of a highly lucrative channel such as ESPN. Having a large customer base can help spread out these costs, but a niche player such as Layer3 will not have that advantage, according to Moffett. \n \nBut Layer3 doesn't need to be everywhere to succeed, according to its chief executive, Binder. It just needs to take enough market share from the big players to win. \n \n\"Maybe you can't quite build the next Facebook,\" he said, \"but you can build something really, really substantial with solid, single-digit percentages [of market share].\" \n \nOther analysts say Layer3 could gain an early edge in usability. With its next-generation set-top boxes, Layer3 may be among the first to integrate on-demand content from streaming services with live cable TV in a way that really pleases consumers, according to Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG. \n \nOther cable companies such as Comcast are working on similar platforms, he added, and it's possible that well-resourced competitors could start chipping away at Layer3's usability lead. \n \n\"But, given the slow pace of innovation in the TV industry, I'm not holding my breath.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"CRM news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Layer3 bets on fat cable bundles, 'white-glove' customer service","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60006","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469483376","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Daily Herald Business Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dhbusinessledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202720759","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Goals from Arjen Robben and David Alaba helped the Bundesliga leaders to secure the 14th win of the season, reports Xinhua news agency. \n \nThe \"Green-Whites\" started on a highly motivated note and kept the uninspired Bavarians busy. Yet, the hosts lacked in accuracy and wasted opportunities. \n \nBayern increased their pressure at the half-hour mark and broke the deadlock out of the blue when Franck Ribery rushed down the left wing to pass into the box to find Robben, who poked home the opener with a one-timer into the bottom right with 31 minutes played. \n \nCarlo Ancelotti's men doubled the lead just before the break as David Alaba curled the ball over the wall into the top right corner following a free kick from 20 meters. \n \nAfter the restart, Bremen were able to reduce the arrears after Max Kruse overcame Manuel Neuer from close range in the 53rd minute. The hosts gained momentum but Bayern were able to protect their 2-1 lead to the end. \n \nWith the result, Bayern stay atop the standings with a three-point advantage whereas 15th-placed Bremen remain at the edge of the relegation zone. \n \nIn the other match, Leipzig wrapped up an important 2-1 comeback win over third-placed Hoffenheim, whose unbeaten streak ended. \n \nTimo Werner and Marcel Sabitzer were on target to keep the \"Red Bulls\" on Bayern's heels. \n \nDespite being under pressure in the opening period, the visitors from Hoffenheim opened the scoring with 19 minutes into the game. \n \nSebastian Rudy forced a turn over following a Leipzig corner, allowing Nadiem Amiri to complete a five-pass counter attack. \n \nLeipzig remained unimpressed and responded in the 38th minute as Timo Werner slotted home Naby Keita's build-up play to restore parity before the half time. \n \nAfter the restart, things went from bad to worse for the visitors as Sandro Wagner received his marching orders following a rude foul play on Stefan Ilsanker in the 60th minute. \n \nThe hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage and snatched the 2-1 winner through Marcel Sabitzer, who unleashed a 22-meter effort to beat Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann in the 77th minute. \n \nWith the 13th victory of the season, Leipzig remain second while Hoffenheim slipped from the third to fourth spot. \n \nElsewhere, Cologne crushed last-placed Darmstadt 6-1 thanks to Yuya Osako's brace. \n \nWolfsburg lost 2-1 to Augsburg while Ingolstadt shocked Hamburg 3-1 and Monchengladbach turned the tides from two goals down to beat Leverkusen 3-2.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: Bundesliga news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Leipzig remain on Bayern's heels in German Bundesliga","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ProKerala.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"261879685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ProKerala.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prokerala.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202735991","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When focusing their learning on what has gone before, how do we know that we are teaching them the right things for what comes next?\" \n \nThe focus, according to Mr Caller, may be better applied to a child's individual talents and skills, using creativity and adapting to advancements in technology and new information as they happen. \n \nMr Caller said: \"In private tutoring, we see time after time how focusing on a child's individual interests and talents, and adapting teaching styles and lesson planning to compliment them, results in a child who is more interested and eager to learn. Tutors International is now seeing clients who are already starting to look for 'outside the box' thinkers when selecting their private tutors [2]. They want someone who can expose their child to a wide range of topics, concepts and ideas from an early age, and use new advancements in technology to their learning advantage. They want someone who can 'move with the times', and this paves the way for some very exciting job opportunities for forward thinking tutors, worldwide.\" \n \nWith a career in education spanning over 25 years, Mr Caller believes that embracing these latest developments and incorporating them into a child's own individual curriculum, while prioritising their creativity and nurturing a natural curiosity, is key in shaping adults that can use their own skills to adapt and succeed in a world that their teachers may never get to experience. \n \nTutors International places exceptional tutors with families based on their individual needs and circumstances.

In fact, it seems that this formula is working pretty well for the company and that it has enticed a lot of consumers in India. \n  \nOn a similar note, while Xiaomi has achieved a great feat by releasing the successor to the popular Redmi Note 3, the new smartphone could have been a better device. Not that we are being greedy or something but Xiaomi could have gone on to set a big example to show that it is possible to launch a featured-packed smartphone with aggressive pricing. \n \nSEE ALSO:  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review: Xiaomi's budget legacy continues \n \nOn the other hand, we cannot expect a phone priced starting at Rs 9,999 to have everything, but if these features were to be included then Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 would have been the total package. \n \nSo, in this post, we'll discuss the missing features in the Redmi Note 4 and what Xiaomi could have done to make it the unbeatable device. \n \nStay tuned to GizBot for more updates! \n       \n 4K Video or OIS  \n \nWell, if you consider some other smartphones in this range many of them now offer 4K video recording options. But unfortunately, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 lacks the 4K video recording. In addition, the smartphone does not come with OIS (Optical Image Stabilization). Xiaomi could have worked in this department a bit to make the phone even better. \n \nWell if these features were added then certainly the Redmi Note would be unbeatable. Contradictorily, the absence of such small features could easily be a deal breaker for photography fanatics as other mid-range handsets are offering this feature for quite some time now. \n       \n Fast Charging  \n \nThe Redmi Note 4 comes with a huge 4100mAh battery package and if you need to charge the battery then it could easily take around two and half hours to fully charge the device. Now that is a long time to wait for your device to get fully charged. \n \nHowever, to solve this, Xiaomi could have added the support for fast charging and with this support it would have been much more convenient for the user. \n \nSEE ALSO:  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4: Reasons you should get this smartphone \n       \n USB Type-C  \n \nWhile many smartphone manufacturers are now introducing the more user-friendly USB Type-C standard, Xiaomi with its 2017 product has failed to bring in the feature with the smartphone. Why we are fussing about it is because the regular micro-USB standard is rapidly ageing and in fact needs to go. If we consider the benefits of the new USB Type-C standard, it makes charging smartphone or connecting the data cable a bit easier, faster and more intuitive. \n \nTaking into account that Redmi Note 3 was a successful handset in India, Redmi Note 4 could have been much interesting product with the addition of the Type-C port. And further it could have been a great start for their product specially designed for India. \n \nSEE ALSO:  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4: 10 accessories to make it look and function better \n       \n Screen Protection  \n \nThe 5.5-inch 1080p IPS display on the Redmi Note 4 is not protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass. While it does come with a strengthened 2.5D curved glass that is less prone to scratches, but the addition of the Gorilla Glass would have added better safety feature. \n       \n NFC  \n \nWhile Xiaomi seems to have done the research and considered NFC not necessary, it is really disappointing that the Redmi Note 4 misses out on this feature. NFC is a very basic and essential feature and should be available in all midrange phones. Moreover, at this price tag, there are many smartphones which do offer NFC. Xiaomi should keep all these small things in mind. \n \nHaving said all that, we do think that the latest Redmi Note 4 is a great update over the Redmi Note 3 and Xiaomi has done its part to bring an attractive device to the market. However, we do hope that this wish list of ours hopefully gets fulfilled in the next Xiaomi Redmi Note series smartphones. \n \nClick Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals \n     \nStay tuned to GizBot for more updates!","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Samden Sherpa"},"topics":[{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Missing features that Xiaomi could have added to the Redmi Note 4","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Gizbot.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"538595106","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Gizbot.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://gizbot.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202742478","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gizbot.com/img/2017/01/xiaomi-redmi-note-4-accessories-make-it-look-function-better-27-1485522575-29-1485676257.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Its vehicle controls and responsiveness are better suited to gamers who like their vehicles to feel more like the real thing. Not to say that the vehicle controls in Saints Row 2 don't work, but they do feel more arcade-like. \n \nBy comparison, Saints Row 2 is more a shooter fan's game. The supply of guns and ammo is greater and, if you run out, you have the option to buy more (in the original, though, you can run-out of ammo completely). The accuracy of the weapons in Saints Row 2 also are much better for more bullets hitting their targets. \n \nSaints Row 2 looks better, but as an driving adventure game, Saints Row feels better. The story for Saints Row is a little more solid, but the shooting controls in Saints Row 2 are much better. Choose the game that best fits your play-style and you won't go wrong. \n \nThanks for reading; game on! \n  Submit Blog  Love this blog?

True or false? \n \n\n \n\n  \nLuxury EVs \n \nLuxury EVs like the Tesla Model S and Model X are perhaps the most expensive modern vehicles one can maintain. Don\u2019t take our word for it. Here is the Tesla maintenance program offerings directly from its website: \n \n\n \n\n  \nFurther, \u201cTesla recommends an Annual Service Inspection every year or 12,500 miles to maintain your vehicle to top performance standards.\u201d The company also says this is the most economical way to maintain your vehicle and it includes such things as tire service, software updates, windshield wipers, keyfob batteries and the like. In the northern area of New England, Tesla presently has two service centers to cover the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. So budget your time and maybe factor in a hotel room. \n \n \u2013 EV Buyer\u2019s Guide \u2013 Gas Savings vs. Other Green Car Options \n \nContrast Tesla\u2019s service fees with those from Jaguar and BMW.  Jaguar includes service on its (gasoline) vehicles for the first five years of ownership. BMW does for four years. Had you heard that Tesla offered a flat $100 service fee  for home visits? It did, but that went out the window. Along with free unlimited Supercharger use and Tesla\u2019s resale value guarantee . \n \n\n \n\n  \nWhich leads us to the least expensive luxury EV to maintain, the BMW i3 . By including all required maintenance (except tire replacement) for four years, BMW pretty much blows the rest of the EV field out of the water in terms of cost management. Trade, or return a leased BMW at year four and you have a fixed cost of ownership. The same is true of any BMW gasoline or diesel-powered car. After the four years is up, which will be less expensive to maintain? Presumably, the i3 would be. One difficulty is that there aren\u2019t many four-year old BMW i3s yet. Time will tell. \n \n[embedded content] \n \n[embedded content] \n  \nAffordable EVs \n \nThe spoiler for affordable EVs like the Leaf has been the Toyota Prius . Offering similar performance, and in many markets, a lower cost per mile for energy , the Prius drives EV fans nuts. The Prius eliminated three of the main maintenance items older gasoline-powered cars required. It has no power steering fluid to change, there is no timing belt to service, and there is no \u201ctune up\u201d required. \n \nMaking the cost comparison more difficult is that Toyota includes maintenance for two years. That puts the Prius ahead of the affordable EVs in general, particularly for those that lease or plan to trade after four or five years. Oil changes are once per year (10K miles) for the Prius too, so the owner\u2019s four-year cost of oil is about $160, rounding up. Early in the Nissan Leaf\u2019s run, Consumer Reports asked the local Nissan dealer they visited to perform the 1-year/15K service required in the Leaf\u2019s Service and Maintenance Guide . The $291.91 fee caused quite a stir. To its credit, Nissan includes the inspections required (not the brake fluid and cabin air filter changes) for the first two years. These include gear oil, steering linkages, ball joints, and similar. \n \nThe very high costs Tesla charges for maintenance and the surprisingly high costs of the Leaf Consumer Reports discovered offer a lesson for EV shoppers: Don\u2019t assume automakers will actually charge you less to maintain an EV, regardless of what the theoretical cost should be. Ask the dealer you buy your EV from what they charge to maintain the vehicle before you commit. If they offer you the line that \u201cSkipping the maintenance will not void your warranty\u201d that may sound attractive. Setting aside why it is necessary if that is the case, remember that when you go to trade your EV at some future point yours will be the one for sale with \u201cNo maintenance records available.\u201d \n \nShopping for a new or used EV?

Try to imagine monorail-style structures, but instead of a monorail car gliding along the top of the rail, there would be a tube with shuttles to whisk you to your destination. \n \nNow imagine your personal car pulling up to a hyperloop station, driving into the tube, and zipping you to wherever you want to go without the bother of that whole road trip thing. Hyperloop One senior vice president, global field operations, Nick Earle told The Verge , \u201cThe idea is you have a transmitter in your car. As you approach the hyperloop, it would be like a fast pass on the freeway. So you actually get the ability to open the air lock and drive into the tube.\u201d \n \nIt hinges on the availability of autonomous cars. An autonomous vehicle isn\u2019t solely about driving without human intervention. The autonomy extends to communication so cars can talk to each other and to the infrastructure. If traffic gets congested on your usual route, an autonomous car will have this information ahead of time and be able to reroute you around the trouble. This is how they plan to communicate with your car and get it to a hyperloop station so you don\u2019t have to endure the traffic jams of the annual family road trip. \n \nLooking for a new or used car? Check out BestRide\u2019s listings search here. \n \nThe problem is making the tech work and then finding the cash to build it all. Hyperloop One figures it will cost about $11.5 million per mile of tube, which is outrageous. Still, they have funding to get it started and plan to test it some time early this year. \n  Related Posts","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nicole Wakelin"},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Hyperloop One Wants to Put Cars in Super-Fast Tubes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"33880","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winter Haven","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Winter Haven News Chief","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681948","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Winter Haven News Chief","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newschief.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://hyperloop-one.com/","http://bestride.com/","http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14314986/hyperloop-one-self-driving-car-global-challenge-nevada-test"],"sequenceId":"695202750859","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wayne","zipCode":"48150","state":"Michigan","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Livonia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Redford Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169876645","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Redford Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://hometownlife.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695202754134","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

While his dad, Doc Rivers , says he\u2019s open to trading his son, I still find it hard to believe that he would actually do it. But if it happens, his value would most likely take a hit, depending on where he lands. But as long as he\u2019s with the Clippers, he should continue to rack up points and 3-pointers. He was quiet in Saturday\u2019s ugly blowout loss to the Clippers with 10 points and six assists on 3-of-11 shooting, but played 38 minutes and was averaging 19.8 points, 4.4 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his previous five games. \n \nT.J. McConnell Sixers 41% - McConnell\u2019s not a big scorer, but has been racking up assists at an alarming rate lately. He hit double digits in assists in three straight games before scoring 13 points with eight dimes on Friday. He\u2019s starting for the Sixers and averaging 9.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, 9.4 assists and 1.6 steals on 53 percent shooting over his last five games. I wish he was a 3-point shooter, but he\u2019s not. \n \nMatthew Dellavedova Bucks 30% - Delly took over the starting job from Malcolm Brogdon five games ago and is averaging 13.0 points, 5.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.8 3-pointers in 29 minutes a game over that stretch. Brogdon has more upside and talent, but Delly\u2019s putting up better numbers right now. He\u2019s also had at least 14 points and six dimes in three of his last five games. \n \nRaymond Felton Clippers 24% - Felton has bounced in and out of the starting lineup since Chris Paul went down and played just 17 minutes for two points and three assists on 1-of-3 shooting in Tuesday\u2019s loss to the Sixers. He bounced back on Saturday with 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, a block and two 3-pointers on Saturday, and even played garbage time in a blowout loss because the Clippers simply don\u2019t have healthy points guards right now. Over his last five he\u2019s averaging 10 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 38 percent shooting. His shooting took a hit on Saturday when he hit just 3-of-12 shots, but he\u2019s getting enough minutes (27.8 in his last five) to make a fantasy dent, and his shooting should be better than this going forward.  \n \nMalcolm Brogdon Bucks 55% - Brogdon lost his job to Dellavedova and had scored six or fewer points in three of his last four games before bouncing back with 11 points and five assists on Saturday, although he hit just 4-of-12 shots. He\u2019s averaging just 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.4 steals and just 0.2 3-pointers in his five games since being moved to the bench. Brogdon has plenty of time to reclaim the job or make a comeback, but as long as Delly\u2019s starting, things aren\u2019t looking great for Brogdon. \n \nEditor\u2019s Note : Golf is coming soon to FanDuel! And they\u2019ve created the Tee Off Classic to celebrate, offering you an opportunity to win a VIP trip for 3 to play a round of golf with Jerome Bettis! Play now . \n \nShooting Guards \n \nDion Waiters Heat 58% - Waiters was at it again on Saturday with 17 points and seven assists, but hit just 1-of-9 3-pointers, or his line would have been a lot bigger. Waiters is averaging 25.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.4 3-pointers over his last five games, knocking down 52 percent of his shots. He\u2019ll take a bit of a hit once Tyler Johnson is back from his shoulder injury, which should happen any day. He\u2019ll also get stung again by the return of Josh Richardson , but even with those guys lurking, Waiters is hot enough right now to be owned in all leagues. Just know that if you pick him up for the upcoming week, you probably missed the best five-game streak of his season. \n \nSeth Curry Mavericks 49% - Curry looks like a full-time starter the rest of the way for the struggling Mavericks, has scored in double figures in six straight games, and is averaging 15 points, three rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.2 steals and 2.4 3-pointers in 31.4 minutes per game over his last five. If he continues to start the rest of the season, Curry should be owned in a lot more leagues. \n \nIman Shumpert Cavaliers 28% - Shumpert had scored in double figures in six straight games before hitting just 2-of-8 shots for six points and three steals in Friday\u2019s win over the Nets. He was 0-for-5 from downtown in that one, but had hit at least two 3-pointers in each of his previous six games. Forget about Friday\u2019s dud and consider Shumpert a favorite to average around 15 points, 2.0 steals and close to 3.0 3-pointers going forward. \n \nGary Harris Nuggets 63% - Harris came through on Saturday with 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a 3-pointers, but the Suns typically give it up to opposing guards. He\u2019s averaging 11 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 45 percent shooting over his last five games, but he\u2019d have a lot more fantasy appeal if Will Barton wasn\u2019t getting at least 20 minutes night. \n \nGarrett Temple Kings 25% (and Arron Afflalo ) - I\u2019m not a big Temple guy and there\u2019s really no one from the Kings that I love filling in for Rudy Gay , who\u2019s out for the season with a blown Achilles. But Temple appears to be the best of the bunch, getting 32 minutes with 8.0 points, 2.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.8 3-points on 34 percent shooting over his last five games. Teammate Arron Afflalo might be a better flier, as he\u2019s coming on and averaging 14 points, 1.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his last three games, knocking down 9-of-15 shots in 34 minutes a night in the process. \n  \nWeek 15 Games Played \n \n  \n \n4 Games: BOS, BRK, DEN, DET, MEM, MIN, OKC, ORL, PHI, PHX, SAC, TOR \n \n3 Games: ATL, CHA, CLE, DAL, GSW, HOU, IND, LAC, LAL, MIA, MIL, NOP, NYK, POR, SAN, WAS \n \n2 Games: CHI, UTA \n \nFollow me on Twitter by clicking here! \n \n  \n \nPoint Guards \n \nAustin Rivers Clippers 57 percent owned in Yahoo! leagues \u2013 Rivers has been much better than Raymond Felton since Chris Paul went down and should keep rolling for about another month. While his dad, Doc Rivers , says he\u2019s open to trading his son, I still find it hard to believe that he would actually do it. But if it happens, his value would most likely take a hit, depending on where he lands. But as long as he\u2019s with the Clippers, he should continue to rack up points and 3-pointers. He was quiet in Saturday\u2019s ugly blowout loss to the Clippers with 10 points and six assists on 3-of-11 shooting, but played 38 minutes and was averaging 19.8 points, 4.4 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his previous five games. \n \nT.J. McConnell Sixers 41% - McConnell\u2019s not a big scorer, but has been racking up assists at an alarming rate lately. He hit double digits in assists in three straight games before scoring 13 points with eight dimes on Friday. He\u2019s starting for the Sixers and averaging 9.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, 9.4 assists and 1.6 steals on 53 percent shooting over his last five games. I wish he was a 3-point shooter, but he\u2019s not. \n \nMatthew Dellavedova Bucks 30% - Delly took over the starting job from Malcolm Brogdon five games ago and is averaging 13.0 points, 5.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.8 3-pointers in 29 minutes a game over that stretch. Brogdon has more upside and talent, but Delly\u2019s putting up better numbers right now. He\u2019s also had at least 14 points and six dimes in three of his last five games. \n \nRaymond Felton Clippers 24% - Felton has bounced in and out of the starting lineup since Chris Paul went down and played just 17 minutes for two points and three assists on 1-of-3 shooting in Tuesday\u2019s loss to the Sixers. He bounced back on Saturday with 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, a block and two 3-pointers on Saturday, and even played garbage time in a blowout loss because the Clippers simply don\u2019t have healthy points guards right now. Over his last five he\u2019s averaging 10 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 38 percent shooting. His shooting took a hit on Saturday when he hit just 3-of-12 shots, but he\u2019s getting enough minutes (27.8 in his last five) to make a fantasy dent, and his shooting should be better than this going forward.  \n \nMalcolm Brogdon Bucks 55% - Brogdon lost his job to Dellavedova and had scored six or fewer points in three of his last four games before bouncing back with 11 points and five assists on Saturday, although he hit just 4-of-12 shots. He\u2019s averaging just 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.4 steals and just 0.2 3-pointers in his five games since being moved to the bench. Brogdon has plenty of time to reclaim the job or make a comeback, but as long as Delly\u2019s starting, things aren\u2019t looking great for Brogdon. \n \nEditor\u2019s Note : Golf is coming soon to FanDuel! And they\u2019ve created the Tee Off Classic to celebrate, offering you an opportunity to win a VIP trip for 3 to play a round of golf with Jerome Bettis! Play now . \n \nShooting Guards \n \nDion Waiters Heat 58% - Waiters was at it again on Saturday with 17 points and seven assists, but hit just 1-of-9 3-pointers, or his line would have been a lot bigger. Waiters is averaging 25.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.4 3-pointers over his last five games, knocking down 52 percent of his shots. He\u2019ll take a bit of a hit once Tyler Johnson is back from his shoulder injury, which should happen any day. He\u2019ll also get stung again by the return of Josh Richardson , but even with those guys lurking, Waiters is hot enough right now to be owned in all leagues. Just know that if you pick him up for the upcoming week, you probably missed the best five-game streak of his season. \n \nSeth Curry Mavericks 49% - Curry looks like a full-time starter the rest of the way for the struggling Mavericks, has scored in double figures in six straight games, and is averaging 15 points, three rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.2 steals and 2.4 3-pointers in 31.4 minutes per game over his last five. If he continues to start the rest of the season, Curry should be owned in a lot more leagues. \n \nIman Shumpert Cavaliers 28% - Shumpert had scored in double figures in six straight games before hitting just 2-of-8 shots for six points and three steals in Friday\u2019s win over the Nets. He was 0-for-5 from downtown in that one, but had hit at least two 3-pointers in each of his previous six games. Forget about Friday\u2019s dud and consider Shumpert a favorite to average around 15 points, 2.0 steals and close to 3.0 3-pointers going forward. \n \nGary Harris Nuggets 63% - Harris came through on Saturday with 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a 3-pointers, but the Suns typically give it up to opposing guards. He\u2019s averaging 11 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 45 percent shooting over his last five games, but he\u2019d have a lot more fantasy appeal if Will Barton wasn\u2019t getting at least 20 minutes night. \n \nGarrett Temple Kings 25% (and Arron Afflalo ) - I\u2019m not a big Temple guy and there\u2019s really no one from the Kings that I love filling in for Rudy Gay , who\u2019s out for the season with a blown Achilles. But Temple appears to be the best of the bunch, getting 32 minutes with 8.0 points, 2.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.8 3-points on 34 percent shooting over his last five games. Teammate Arron Afflalo might be a better flier, as he\u2019s coming on and averaging 14 points, 1.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his last three games, knocking down 9-of-15 shots in 34 minutes a night in the process. \n \nSmall Forwards \n \nCaris LeVert Nets 18% - LeVert has sat out two of his last four games for \u201crest,\u201d but still has a ton of upside and could play heavy minutes the rest of the way for the dead-end Nets. He played 27 minutes on Saturday and hit 4-of-8 shots for 11 points, four rebounds, two steals, a block and a 3-pointer. He played 26 minutes on Wednesday and had 12 points, four assists and a 3-pointer, and while he\u2019s not yet a must-own player, he\u2019s getting pretty close. Hopefully his days of getting random nights off are over. \n \nMarvin Williams Hornets 67% - Williams has quietly scored in double figures in four straight games and is averaging 13.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.6 blocks and 2.2 3-pointers on 43 percent shooting in 29 minutes over his last five games. He\u2019s not nearly as fun to own as he was last season, but is coming on a bit for the Hornets. \n \nMichael Kidd-Gilchrist Hornets 57% - MKG only played 19 minutes on Saturday but there are no reports of an injury. He had four fouls, so I\u2019m going to say that\u2019s the reason for his low minutes in a tough loss to the Kings. Despite the bench time, he had nine points, six rebounds and tied his season high with four blocks in that one. He\u2019s averaging 12.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and is shooting 58 percent over his last five games. He doesn\u2019t hit 3-pointers and won\u2019t get a ton of steals, but is still worth a look in all leagues right now. \n \nKhris Middleton Bucks 39% - Middleton is nearing a return and while we don\u2019t know how long it will take him to get into basketball shape, he\u2019s hard to ignore after averaging 18.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.8 3-pointers last season. He\u2019s targeting a return near the All-Star break and I like him better as a stash than Ben Simmons , simply because we still don\u2019t have any idea when Simmons will make his debut with the Sixers. \n \nJaylen Brown Celtics 4% - Brown has started in two straight games as Al Horford sits with a groin injury. Brown blew up for a career-high 20 points, eight rebounds and two 3-pointers in 30 minutes on Friday. He then started again on Saturday and had nine points, eight rebounds, two steals, a block and a 3-pointer in 28 minutes, hitting 3-of-9 shots. He\u2019s far from a must-own player, but if Horford\u2019s injury lingers, or if Brad Stevens decides he\u2019s ready to roll with Brown, he\u2019s at least worth a spot on your watch list. \n \nPower Forwards \n \n  \n \nTerrence Jones Pelicans 59% - Jones bounces in and out of the starting lineup like nobody\u2019s business, but is getting solid minutes, regardless. And with Anthony Davis constantly getting banged up and visiting the locker room during games, TJ is the ultimate handcuff for the Brow. And even with Brown playing on most nights, Jones is averaging 17.8 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.0 steals, 1.4 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers on 51 percent shooting in 25 minutes per game over his last five. He should be owned across the board. \n \nDavid Lee Spurs 43% - Lee has played in nine straight games, so he\u2019s due to get Popped any day now with a DNP. But with Pau Gasol out indefinitely, Lee is suddenly very relevant, scoring in double figures in five straight games with double-doubles in three of those. He\u2019s averaging 12.6 points and 9.8 rebounds on 62 percent shooting in 29 minutes over his last five games, but he doesn\u2019t do much besides make shots and crash the boards. \n \nP.J. Tucker Suns 20% - Tucker had another nice line on Saturday with 12 points, six boards, five assists, a steal and two 3-pointers in 36 minutes. He\u2019s averaging 11.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.4 3-pointers on 49 percent shooting in a whopping 35 minutes per game off the bench over his last five. \n \nJon Leuer Pistons 43% - Leuer was a dud with just eight points and one rebound in 24 minutes on Saturday, but hit 4-of-5 shots. He scored 15 and 10 points in each of his previous two games and has hit 14-of-22 shots in his three games since returning from a knee injury. He should be a decent source of points, rebounds and 3-pointers while shooting it well and getting the occasional steals and blocks. He\u2019s not a must-own player, but that could change as he rounds back into form. \n \nSpencer Hawes Hornets 1% - Hawes came off the bench for 12 points, seven rebounds and a block in 28 minutes on Saturday and is averaging 9.3 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 blocks on 39 percent shooting over his last three games. Cody Zeller is out with a quad injury right now and Hawes will certainly take a hit when he\u2019s back, but as of this second, he\u2019s at least worth a look in some leagues. And if Zeller continues to miss time, Hawes is a decent flier, especially as a cheap, DFS center. \n \nBonus:  Anthony Tolliver and Willie Cauley-Stein both played well for the Kings on Saturday, and while they didn\u2019t officially make this list, they\u2019re worth keeping an eye on right now and should be available in most leagues. Tolliver finally had a good game with 14 points, seven boards, three assists, two steals, a block and four 3-pointers in 30 minutes. He had scored six or fewer points in three of his previous four games, but Saturday\u2019s line was more in line with what most of us were expecting when Gay went down. \n \nWCS played just 14 minutes but hit 6-of-7 shots for 13 points and three rebounds, but if you\u2019re going to take a flier on a big King, Tolliver\u2019s the guy I\u2019d aim for right now, but the bottom line is that I don\u2019t trust him. \n \nCenters \n \nIvica Zubac Lakers 19% - The 19-year-old phenom has double-doubled in two straight games and three of his last five, and the Lakers want to keep giving him minutes. The fact that Zubac is on the Lakers\u2019 roster and so talented makes the summer signing of Timofey Mozgov that much more perplexing. The Zupacalypse is averaging 9.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks on 46 percent shooting over his last five games, but the poor shooting is a result of a 5-of-15 night against the Blazers last Wednesday. He\u2019s my favorite center to pick up right now. \n \nWilly Hernangomez Knicks 21% - Willy H has played well in three straight games and might be getting ready to be turned loose by the Knicks. He\u2019s averaging 8.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 0.5 blocks on 50 percent shooting over his last four. He\u2019s likely to be a bit hit-or-miss going forward, but his arrow is pointing up. \n \nJusuf Nurkic Nuggets 41% - I thought we might have a Nurk Alert, as Nikola Jokic was out on Saturday and will miss at least one more game with his weird hip injury, but Nurkic didn\u2019t come through. He started, but played just 15 minutes and finished with five points, four rebounds and nothing else. While that\u2019s a lot better than the DNP he had on Thursday, Nurkic continues to sit in the shadows in Denver. I would not be at all surprised to see him start again on Tuesday against the Lakers, and have a big game against them, but using him in that one is a complete roll of the dice. The Nuggets basically rolled without a center for most of the night on Saturday and Tyson Chandler had a big night because of it. But if Jokic is going to miss more than just one more game, Nurkic should at least still be on watch lists until we see how this plays out. \n \nWillie Reed Heat 7% - Hassan Whiteside played through his sprained ankle on Saturday, but wasn\u2019t great against a tough Pistons\u2019 defense. Reed, who started for an injured Whiteside on Friday, played 19 minutes and had just two points, five rebounds and three blocks in that one. In Saturday\u2019s start, he went off for 20 points and five rebounds on 9-of-11 shooting. Reed is not a must-own player, by any stretch, but with constant chatter about Whiteside being a shutdown candidate, Reed does have some fantasy appeal right now. Any time Whiteside is out Reed looks like a must-start player, and if Whitey ever goes down for an extended period of time, Reed would quickly become one of the hotter pickups in the league. But for now you can probably leave him on the waiver wire, unless you have a deep bench and want Whiteside insurance. \n \nDewayne Dedmon Spurs 4% - Dedmon\u2019s minutes have been all over the place since Pau Gasol went down. He\u2019s played 19, 10, 29, 19 and 8 minutes in each of his last five games, so it\u2019s tough to rely on him, obviously. He\u2019s averaging just 5.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 0.6 steals and 0.2 blocks on 63 percent shooting over his last five games. He could turn it on at any time if Gregg Popovich commits to him for at least 20 minutes per night, but for now, he\u2019s probably more deserving of a spot on your watch list than he is a spot in your lineup.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Lakers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Philadelphia 76ers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Waiver Wired - Wired: Top NBA Pickups Week 15","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fairfield","zipCode":"06901","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stamford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roto World","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665003","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"95"},"name":"Roto World","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rotoworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/docktora","http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_6856b_1580c_&affid=4892&siteid=6856&adid=1580&c="],"sequenceId":"695202759043","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Those kids are well-trained, you can\u2019t take anything away from a B team, a C team, it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re all tough.\u201d \n\nIn third place was Plymouth (130), a last-minute addition to the tournament, with Farmington (124.5), Wayne Memorial (124), Canton (120), Livonia Stevenson (113), Novi (112.5), Livonia Churchill and Lutheran Westland (112 each) rounding out the top 10. \n\nEarning MVP honors for the lower weights was Canton\u2019s Justin Winnie, who won the 135-pound championship. Salem\u2019s Bruce Haslitt took home the prize for upper weights MVP after winning at 145 with his 17th consecutive pin of the season. \n\nBuy Photo \n\nCatholic Central's Dan Rehfeldt, left, grapples with Farmington's Anthony Averiette in the championship bout at 103. (Photo: JUNFU HAN | STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \n\nBecause of fewer teams participating, the tourney was changed from a 16-man bracket to to a round-robin affair. \n\n\u201cIt was a last minute thing once we saw the numbers in the weight classes,\u201d said Livonia Churchill head wrestling coach Marty Altounian, the event organizer. \u201cInstead of having someone getting two matches most of them got four or five doing it this way. \n\n\u201cIt was a little confusing, yes, but it paid off for the quality of wrestling they got.\u201d \n\nLivonia Stevenson head coach Dan Vaughan said the format change took some getting used to, but for the most part the overall tournament quality remained good. \n\n\u201cI think there were some weight classes that were really packed full of good kids, 125 pops out in my mind, 140 was not bad,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cHeavyweight seemed pretty deep.\u201d \n\nBuy Photo \n\nSalem's Bruce Haslitt, left, defeats Catholic Central's Robert Walston in the 145 final.

(Photo: JUNFU HAN | STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \n\nOn the podium \n\nOf course, Catholic Central wrestlers were often in the mix for medals and points (the top six per weight class reached the podium). \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really pleased with the way our guys wrestled,\u201d Ianni said. \u201cThey practiced, they worked their butts off day in and day out. They have for the last few months, so it\u2019s good they get to come here and show it in front of everybody.\u201d \n\nCapturing first place in their weights for the Shamrocks were Dan Rehfeldt (103 pounds), Davis Rastigue (125), Brody Burke (152), Brendin Yatooma (160) and Dane Flynn (189). \n\nAnother four lost in the \u201cspotlight finals,\u201d when Churchill gymnasium lights were dimmed so fans could focus on the one bout taking place. \n\nEarlier in the tourney, as many as four matches took place simultaneously. \n\nFor Ianni, a Catholic Central alum who wrestled his senior year at Observerland, it always is a plus to bring a contingent to the tourney. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a tradition for us,\u201d Ianni said. \u201cI graduated in 2007 and this was a huge tournament for us then and we still like to come back and have a presence here. We\u2019re happy coming back.\u201d \n\nIanni, meanwhile, said there is a \u201cpretty good difference\u201d between the Blue and White teams, but that didn\u2019t provide much solace for the 13 other high schools there (another team, Salem\u2019s B squad, also competed). \n\n\u201cWe got a few guys on the White team who even though they\u2019re teammates they like to get after the guys ahead of them,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey like to push them pretty hard, that\u2019s what makes the whole program better. \n\n\u201c... Brendin Yatooma\u2019s had time on the Blue team, Dane Flynn. It\u2019s really next man up, so whenever somebody needs to fill in, we\u2019re happy putting anybody out there.\u201d \n\nRock solid \n\nEarning second-place honors in the team standings was Salem, spearheaded by senior Haslitt\u2019s pin in 1:59 against CC\u2019s Robert Walston. It gave Haslitt 98 career pins and plenty of momentum as he takes a run at the school mark of 104 set in 1986 by state champion Dave Dameron. \n\n\u201cThis tournament\u2019s come down a little bit,\u201d said Salem head coach Jeremy Henderson, a former Observerland and state champion. \u201cBut to be able to pin your way all the way through the finals at this thing is still something to be proud of. \n\n\u201cBruce has turned it on at the right time of the season, he\u2019s going to be tough to beat the next couple weeks.\u201d \n\nCanton\u2019s Winnie, a senior, won 11-6 in the 135 final against Northville freshman Nick Gattoni. \n\n\u201cI knew I just had to keep my pace high,\u201d Winnie said. \u201cI knew he was a freshman, I just had to go out and wrestle my match.\u201d \n\nHaslitt, Winnie and Farmington\u2019s Jake Justice (who won at 130 with a pin over the Shamrocks\u2019 Kale Kazyak) all said they were pumped up to wrestle in the spotlight finals. \n\n\u201cYou never get to feel the same type of experience as this,\u201d said Haslitt, adding with a laugh that \u201cI feel like I\u2019m about to have a heart attack every match.\u201d \n\nJustice said the success he and teammates had Saturday (also winning was heavyweight Donovan King, with Anthony Averiette reaching the finals at 103) will help the Falcons\u2019 overall team confidence moving forward into state tournament time. \n\n\u201cI feel a lot of the guys are going to want to keep going in the room as hard as they can now, now that they know we\u2019ve had some wrestlers that were placing,\u201d Justice continued. \n\nFull marks \n\nPlymouth came home with one championship win in 112-pounder Tyler Campbell. \n\n\u201cFor him to get first today is pretty awesome for him,\u201d Plymouth head coach Josh Leege said. \u201cHe\u2019s a junior, so this is definitely the year he\u2019s seeing his hard work pay off.\u201d \n\nBuy Photo \n\nSquaring off in the final at 119 during Saturday's Observerland tournament are Lutheran Westland's Christian Zimmerman (left) and Livonia Churchill's Ethan Englehart.

They all wrestled really well.\u201d \n\nVaughan said Alcodray \u201cdid what he was supposed to do and win the tournament and we\u2019re looking forward to districts.\u201d \n\nWayne Memorial didn\u2019t win any first-place medals, but the Zebras did have five finalists in Nick Daniels (125), Jalen Adams (152), Kevaughn Henderson (171), Chris Fletcher (215) and Anthony Calloway (285). \n\n\u201cWe took seven today so five of them made the finals,\u201d Crothers said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a pretty good day for us.\u201d \n\n26TH OBSERVERLAND \n\nWRESTLING TOURNAMENT \n\nJan. 28 at Livonia Churchill \n\nTEAM STANDINGS: 1.

His shot from the edge of the box took a deflection off Phoenix defender Jacob Tratt to wrong-foot Glen Moss.\n\nThe only assistance Phoenix left back Doyle needed to score four minutes later was from Adelaide's left upright as his blistering shot from the edge of the box cannoned in off the post.\n\nThe pace of the game ebbed and flowed from there as the match required drinks breaks every 15 minutes. The Phoenix looked better coming out of the first break, but Adelaide grabbed the upper hand before and after the second.\n\nThat meant it was somewhat against the run of play when Krishna gave the Phoenix the lead in the 37th minute, just beating the offside trap to race away for a slick goal on the counter.\n\nBarbarouses should have put his side up by two before halftime when rounding Galekovic in his box, but didn't pull the trigger from a tight angle and didn't have any support to lay off to when he looked to play a pass.\n\nEven after that chance, it was tough on Adelaide to be trailing given their 15 first-half shots. Wellington were sloppy playing out of the back and only inaccurate Adelaide finishing meant the Phoenix's mistakes went unpunished. \n\nThe Phoenix started brightly in the second half with Roly Bonevacia just unable to get a toe onto a Barbarouses cross within five minutes of the resumption. Ten minutes later Eugene Galekovic made a good save to deny the Dutchman.\n\nAdelaide looked to be struggling, but came back strongly in the final 20 minutes as Wellington wilted.\n\nTwice they squandered chances to equalise before Mileusnic finally drew his side level. Moss was only able to push a Ben Garuccio freekick onto his post, with Mileusnic on hand to bundle the ball across the line.\n\nAdelaide's Sergio Cirio will not look back fondly on this game. Twice in the final 20 minutes he had golden chances to score what would have been the winning goal, but both times he sent his shots from close range horrendously wide of the mark.\n\nThe Phoenix players would have been horrified to see the fourth official signal seven minutes of added time due to the drinks break, but somehow they held on for a point which sees them remain in seventh place, while Adelaide stay in last.\n\nAs for the hot conditions, the A-League heat policy doesn't go off everyday temperatures, rather it involves Wet Bulb Globe Temperature readings. That's meant to give a measure of comfort levels and was low enough to start the match. Wellington Phoenix 2 (Tom Doyle 11', Roy Krishna 37') Adelaide United 2 (Riley McGree 7', Nikola Mileusnic 80').

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n   \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n   \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n   \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n   \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n   \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n   \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n   \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n   \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n   \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n   \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n   \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n   \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n   \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n   \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n   \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n   \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n   \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n   \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n   \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n   \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n   \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n   \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n   \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n   \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n   \nLOS ANGELES \n   \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n   \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n   \nSAN FRANCISCO \n   \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n   \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bannock","zipCode":"83204","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pocatello","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho State Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"473"},"name":"Idaho State Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatejournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202775414","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/idahostatejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/e1/fe167ffe-6668-5096-ac6f-037081ed111f/588d691355d1d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C196"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Johnston","zipCode":"27577","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Smithfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Raleigh News & Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658506","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2271"},"name":"Raleigh News & Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202779654","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(4 of ) President Donald Trump reacts to a question from a members of the media during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May in the East Room of the White House White House in Washington, Friday, Jan. 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) | There are several ways to understand the political cacophony emanating from Washington over this past, frenetic week.\n\nSome of it represents a noxious partisan effort to eradicate everything done by President Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress, whether it worked or not. This is the kind of tribal revenge more common in primitive societies, a score settling designed not only to crush the other party but also to demoralize and punish the voters who support it. Neither the White House nor the Republican leadership now bother even to make the pretense that they intend to consult or work with Democrats. And Democrats are responding in kind with party line votes against Cabinet nominees. With a U.S. Supreme Court nomination coming this week, this partisan warfare will shift into Defcon 1.\n\nSome of the cacophony is driven by ideological passions and the systematic effort to finally eradicate all vestiges of what hard-line conservatives view as socialism, from civil rights laws to environmental regulations, from consumer and worker protections to public education, from activist fiscal and monetary policy to all manifestations of the redistributionist welfare state. The tea party, you might say, is on a bender and if its rhetoric is any indication, the aim goes well beyond repealing the New Deal; it is to return the size and scope of government to where it was in 1900, before the Progressive era.\n\nNeither Republican partisanship nor conservative ideology, however, can adequately explain the unconventional behavior of the new president, who spent much of his first week in office spinning tall tales about the size of his inaugural crowds, the massive voter fraud that lay behind his popular vote loss, the deep respect he has for an intelligence community he once called incompetent or his still-evolving scheme for getting Mexico to pay for the $25 billion wall along the Rio Grande.\n\nIdeology and partisanship cannot explain why the president continues to tweet out policy pronouncements at all hours of the night based on what he saw on the internet or cable news. They cannot explain why he stubbornly refuses to separate himself from his business interests around the world. They cannot explain why he insists on waging war against the mainstream media, which he views as the enemy.\n\nTo the Washington political establishment \u2014 the politicians and bureaucrats, the lawyers and the lobbyists, the policy wonks and the campaign hacks \u2014 Trump\u2019s behavior seems crazy, counterproductive and comical. But, of course, that\u2019s just the point. From the beginning, his campaign and his political persona have been about one thing \u2014 exposing and defeating Washington\u2019s meritocratic elite. And now that he\u2019s won the presidency by defeating that establishment, there is nothing that gives him more satisfaction, or endears him more to his core supporters, than flouting the norms of political behavior that the elites have long used to disqualify challengers and keep themselves in power. Trump is not satisfied to have conquered Rome. He means to sack it.\n\nWhat Trump understands, and what the elites have trouble accepting, is that he won the presidency not in spite of his insulting tweets, his bald-face lies, his lack of knowledge and his refusal to follow political convention, but because of them. And the more he does it, the more he is criticized for it, the longer it allows him to dominate the news and suck the oxygen out of the political conversation, the more power he will have over the governing process. The political math for the moment is working in his favor. It is true that only about a third of the country approves of Trump and his antics and share his anti-establishment fervor. But, roughly speaking, there is also a third of the country that identifies itself as ideologically conservative and another third who are partisan Republicans. The three groups overlap significantly, but not completely, and it was by drawing support from all three groups that Trump was able to eke out an Electoral College victory. Now in office, his strategy for holding together that coalition is to offer Republican partisans and die-hard conservatives enough of the what they want so that they are willing to overlook his crazy ideas and governing style.\n\n\"This is going to be an unconventional presidency,\" acknowledged Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, after Trump got several ovations from Republicans lawmakers at their retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday. \"That is something we are all going to have to get used to.\"\n\nAt this point, the best hope Democrats have of derailing the Trump Express is not by whipping its own base up in a frenzy, as seems to be their strategy. Rather, it is to persuade a handful of Senate Republicans to jump off the train before it builds up too much momentum, either out of fear for their own personal political survival or out of more high-minded concerns about the direction of policy, the competency of the new administration or the dangers of untethering the political process from long-established norms. All it would take would be one high-profile setback on an appointment or piece of legislation for Trump\u2019s coalition of convenience to start to unravel.\n\nIn the past, Republican Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio and Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have been willing to challenge Trump or break from the Republican ranks. Surely they all understand the consequences of the devilish pact they are being asked to sign onto. But it would require a genuine profile in courage to withstand the furious attacks and political ostracization that would surely befall any who dared to defect. Never underestimate the capacity of politicians to rationalize the irrational.\n\nOtherwise, we should prepare ourselves for at least two years of weeks like the last one, with wild swings in policy based on \"alternative facts,\" personal pique, empty boasts and political vendettas. It was the voters, not the political or media establishments, who handed Trump the keys to kingdom and it may require the voters to take them away.\n\nSteven Pearlstein is a columnist for the Washington Post.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"STEVEN PEARLSTEIN"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Keeping Washington from becoming Crazytown","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sonoma","zipCode":"95401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Rosa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Press Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660830","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Press Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pdpreps.com/","http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/","http://lists.northbaybusinessjournal.com/index.htm","http://www.biteclubeats.com/","http://www.celebratecommunity.org/","http://www.northbaycarsearch.com/","http://www.capublicnotice.com/","http://www.pdmediasource.com/","http://santarosapressdemocrat.ca.newsmemory.com/ssindex.php"],"sequenceId":"695202779970","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=rG52kyw58ZtSD73wEMxQZc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYssRWyHhkDeAhPaxgU7zlnbWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

Amid our thirst for adult coloring books and stories about missing girls and reincarnated puppies, some grim old classics are speaking to us with new urgency. Ray Bradbury\u2019s \"Fahrenheit 451,\" Aldous Huxley\u2019s \"Brave New World\" and Margaret Atwood\u2019s \"The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\" have all risen up the latest paperback bestseller list.\n\nBut by far the greatest beneficiary of our newly piqued national anxiety is George Orwell\u2019s \"1984.\"\n\nSoon after senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said that the administration was issuing \"alternative facts,\" Orwell\u2019s classic novel spiked to No. 1 on Amazon. Like officials from the Ministry of Truth, Conway and White House press secretary Sean Spicer doubled down on Trump\u2019s fanciful contention that his inauguration drew the \"largest audience ever,\" despite a web-full of photographic evidence to the contrary. The Twittersphere responded with allusions to \"1984,\" and Penguin announced plans for a special 75,000-copy reprint, noting that since the inauguration, sales for the novel have increased by 9,500 percent.\n\nLeaders have always tried to manipulate the truth, of course, and modern politicians of all persuasions want to \"control the narrative,\" but there\u2019s something freshly audacious about the president\u2019s assault on basic math, his effort to assemble from the substance of his vanity hundreds of thousands of fans on the National Mall.\n\nAlmost 70 years after \"1984\" was first published, Orwell suddenly feels doubleplus relevant. Considering the New Trumpmatics, it\u2019s impossible not to remember Winston Smith, the hero of \"1984,\" who predicted, \"In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it.\"\n\nOrwell biographer Gordon Bowker is not at all surprised by the renewed interest. \"The continuing popularity of \u2018Nineteen Eighty-four\u2019 is a reminder,\" he said via email, \"of the threat to democracy posed by those with power who proclaim \u2018alternative facts\u2019 and deny objective truths. Big Brother\u2019s pronouncements are treated as absolute truth by his acolytes, even when they defy rational thought \u2014 so Black is White, 2+2=5, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength.\"\n\nBorn in 1903, Orwell lived through two world wars and saw the rise of totalitarian regimes on an unpresidentedscale. In a widely quoted letter written in 1944, he decried to \"the horrors of emotional nationalism and a tendency to disbelieve in the existence of objective truth.\" He went on to explain with rising alarm: \"Already history has in a sense ceased to exist, ie. there is no such thing as a history of our own times which could be universally accepted, and the exact sciences are endangered.\" Now we\u2019re being told that millions of illegal immigrants kept Trump from winning the popular vote, and that the science behind climate change is a Chinese hoax.\n\nThis is ungood.\n\nBut Democrats shouldn\u2019t feel too smug about Trump\u2019s fluency in Newspeak. The Obama administration did its best to conceal that the National Security Agency is listening to our electronic communications, an eerie parallel to the surveillance described in \"1984.\" And it was President Bill Clinton who brought the country to a constitutional climax by claiming that the truth of his testimony regarding \"that woman\" depended \"on what the meaning of the word \u2018is\u2019 is\" \u2014 an Orwellian clarification if there ever was one. Besides, Orwell wasn\u2019t writing about a particular party. Although he was inspired by full-scale abuses in the Soviet Union, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, he was also borrowing from the methods of communication control he had witnessed in Britain. He was describing, in other words, the basic function of power, the tendency of leaders and governments \u2014 \"from Conservatives to Anarchists\" \u2014 to cement their authority by controlling our language and by extension our thought and behavior.\n\nLike most people who still pick up a newspaper in their yard every morning, I first read \"1984\" in school, long before 1984. I can remember worrying about how much of what Orwell described might come true by that year. But as a teenager, what frightened me most was those horrible torture scenes, particularly the unspeakable threat of the rat mask that eventually breaks Winston\u2019s will. Only later did I start to appreciate the real profundity of Orwell\u2019s insights, laid out so succinctly in his 1946 essay \"Politics and the English Language.\"\n\nIn that brilliant critique, Orwell casts the blame for political corruption widely, and he insists that we all bear a responsibility to resist it by thinking and especially by writing more clearly. \"One ought to recognize,\" he wrote, \"that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.\" There\u2019s a patriotic challenge you won\u2019t hear coming from Washington no matter which party is in power.\n\nFortunately, we\u2019re not living under the dystopian terror that Orwell described in \"1984.\" Our new leader is not the manufactured icon of a supreme state.

Then it converted compacts like the Skylark to front-wheel drive. \n \nThis Skylark\u2019s final resting place had it facing another Malaise Era GM, a 1979 Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon Brougham . \n \n \n\n \n \nThe Cutlass is an example of downsizing on a then-common rear-wheel drive platform. The Cutlass gave an extra nod to tradition by retaining a full frame underneath, rather than switching to the lighter unibodies favored by Ford and others. \n \nFind a Ford Fairmont with BestRide\u2019s local search. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe Skylark is an example of the later phase of GM downsizing, which switched to front-wheel drive and a light-weight unibody. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe Skylark is one of the X-cars, which spread the new designs across four of GM\u2019s divisions. After years of Detroit excess, the X-cars were thrillingly rational and practical, and their tidy packages were exactly right for the stagnant economy surrounding their April 1979 debut. \n \nIt\u2019s a shame that X-car durability fell so far short of the platform\u2019s promise. Skylarks, Omegas, Phoenixes and Citations are getting pretty thin on the ground, but one continuing mark of the junked X-cars we\u2019ve seen is the remarkably low mileage at which they expired. \n \nFind an Oldsmobile Omega near you with BestRide\u2019s local search.   \n \nThis Skylark had less than 62K on the clock. \n \n \n\n \n \nThis old-school odometer has only six digits, so we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s flipped to actually be 162K. On the one hand, the driver\u2019s seat is lightly worn; on the other, the nicked doorjamb has seen many ins and out. \n \n \n\n \n \nOn the other hand, it appears from the body damage that this Skylark still worked hard for the money. \n \n \n\n \n \nWhen it debuted in 1979 as a 1980 model, a base Skylark Limited V6 started at an adjusted-for-2017 $19,700. That price held remarkably steady; this 1985 works out to having almost the same exact 2017 value. \n \nThe Limited sold about half of the cheaper Skylark Custom\u2019s volume. The Custom would have knocked off about $1,300 from this Limited\u2019s adjusted price. \n \nFind a Buick Skylark near you with BestRide\u2019s local search. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe full vinyl roof would have been a $370 option\u2026 \n \n \n\n \n \nand this Limited sports opera lamps in the C-pillar. \n \n \n\n \n \nThis Skylark\u2019s V6 engine was a massive improvement over the base Iron Duke four-cylinder, and it carried an adjusted $600 premium. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe wire wheel covers cost an adjusted $435. \n \n \n\n \n \nInside, this Skylark was pure Buick, with a massive instrument panel and flat-planed presentations. \n \n \n\n \n \nWe see from the skeletal instrument panel that this Skylark had the $110 extra gauge package. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe misaligned glove box door reminds us of Malaise Era quality, when it seemed like a glovebox that closed with a uniform gap was just impossible. \n \n \n\n \n \nOptimus was a Radio Shack brand. Radio Shack is gone, and so are cassettes. Still, this was probably a nice upgrade from the Skylark\u2019s factory radio. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe Limited\u2019s door panels were trimmed with planks and strips of faux wood\u2026 \n \n \n\n \n \n\u2026and rather than side-impact airbags, Skylark Limiteds had side-impact logos. One good smack against that could give you a nice noggin imprint. And yep, there\u2019s more Malaise Era quality here, with black screws and overlapping trim. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe year 1985 was X-car\u2019s last. Phoenix and Omega ended in \u201984, and the Skylark and Citation soldiered on through \u201985. By then, their tooling had long been paid for, so the 93,157 Skylarks and 62,722 Citation IIs made in the final year \u2013 yep, the Skylark outsold the more mass-market Citation II in the final round \u2013 were undoubtedly profitable. \n \nAnd so the X-cars continue trickling into junkyards with low mileage, and they\u2019re a reminder of typical Malaise Era\u2019s ambitions and failings. \n \n \n\n \n \nFind a Buick Skylark near you with BestRide\u2019s local search.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Automotive industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"General Motors news","group":"Companies"}],"title":"JUNKYARD THERAPY: 1985 Buick Skylark Limited \" Luxury X","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"33880","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winter Haven","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Winter Haven News Chief","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681948","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Winter Haven News Chief","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newschief.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bestride.com/blog/class-of-1981-five-cool-cars-from-the-height-of-the-malaise-era/7247/","http://bestride.com/blog/junkyard-therapy-cutlass-vs-skylark-malaise-era-face-off/24866/","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-27.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/streetside-1979-oldsmobile-cutlass-supreme-rococo-formality/23381/","http://bestride.com/blog/streetside-1987-cutlass-ciera-brougham-oldsmobile-on-the-bubble/18378/","http://bestride.com/blog/car-doctor-qa-my-2005-ford-plow-truck-wont-stay-running/24412/","http://bestride.com/cars-for-sale/make/Ford/model/Fairmont/location/","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-2.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/ford-and-general-motors-sued-for-unpaid-music-royalties/5613/","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-1.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/1982-pontiac-phoenix-lj-still-fiery-after-all-these-years/7500/","http://bestride.com/blog/specs-check-compact-chevy-sedans-through-the-years/15726/","http://bestride.com/cars-for-sale/condition/New,Used,CPO/make/Oldsmobile/model/Omega/","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-33.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-32.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-36.jpg","http://bestride.com/cars-for-sale/condition/New,Used,CPO/make/Buick/model/Skylark/year/1984-1998/","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-281.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-41.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-35.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-40.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-39.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-29.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-31.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-30.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-34.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-38.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-37.jpg","http://bestride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/olds_cutlass_buick_skylark_1-3.jpg"],"sequenceId":"695202781779","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She did this live on Facebook. We\u2019ll likely never know why she chose to do it that way. Perhaps she felt invisible. Perhaps she wanted to be seen.\n\nHer self-destruction drew attention, all right, but surely not the kind she wanted. To read the report by the Miami Herald\u2019s Carol Marbin Miller and Alex Harris is to cringe with disgust:\n\n\"A thousand people watched for nearly an hour as Naika Venant prepared to kill herself. They kept watching for another hour as the 14-year-old dangled on her scarf from the shower door in the bathroom of her Miami Gardens foster home.\n\n\"People mocked the young girl, called her names and reacted to the video with Facebook\u2019s laughing emoji, said Antonio Gethers, one of her 4,500 Facebook friends. Others posted cruel parody videos pretending to hang themselves, too.\"\n\nThe bleak despair and dead-end hope that cause people to take their lives is, unfortunately, all too familiar. And those feelings can be magnified dangerously in adolescence, an age where all emotions are outsized, all passions urgent and raw. Factor in that she was a survivor of physical abuse and sexual assault, and it becomes depressingly easy to imagine the forces that drove Naika to destroy herself.\n\nIt is less easy to understand why that act was received the way it was.\n\nThe harsh laughter and cold ridicule of \"people\" \u2014 the word is used advisedly \u2014 who watched Naika\u2019s suicide suggest that we flatter ourselves when we call ourselves a higher species. Apparently, only one individual tried to help; a friend saw the live feed and called police, but inadvertently sent them to the wrong address. By the time it got sorted out, Naika was beyond saving.\n\nMiami-Dade schools chief Alberto Carvalho blames Facebook for what happened, which is as understandable as it is misguided. Might as well blame the sidewalk where Kitty Genovese was killed in 1964 as she screamed for help that didn\u2019t come. Or the Golden Gate Bridge, where a 2006 documentary, \"The Bridge,\" shows passersby passing by without intervening as people climb up on the ledge, preparing to jump. Or the walkway behind a Salem, New Jersey, McDonald\u2019s where a young mother was brutally beaten in 2014 while observers laughed and recorded it on their cellphones.\n\nFacebook is an easy target, but it is not the web service whose behavior is appalling here. It is, rather, the ordinary people, the everyday Janes and Joes who could have acted to save this child, but did not. One is mindful of what\u2019s called \"the bystander effect,\" which, according to Psychology Today, \"occurs when the presence of others hinders an individual from intervening in an emergency situation.\"\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t explain the laughter. It does not make sense of the mocking derision of a troubled child.\n\nNo, that behavior speaks to moral stupidity, to the objectification of other people and their pain, to a selfish inability to extend compassion beyond the barricades of one\u2019s own life. All of which have come to feel far too commonplace. It cries out for families, worship houses and schools to rededicate themselves to teaching what it means to be a truly human being.

Schulz Sonoma County Airport. The building will be used for ticketing and baggage counter for the incoming of American Airlines. (Kent Porter / Press Democrat) 2017 | A year ago, only one commercial airline company flew routes into the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport. Next month, there will be three. The pending arrival of American Airlines prompted the airport last week to move in temporary quarters for additional check-in and baggage handling, even as it gears up for a $20 million expansion of its terminal and parking.\n\n\"2016 was another record year for us,\" said airport manager Jon Stout, noting that passenger counts rose almost 30 percent to 339,000. He expects another increase this year of about 10 percent.\n\nThe nation\u2019s hospitality and travel sector continues to enjoy good times. And 2017 should be another growth year, with stronger household balance sheets and pent-up consumer demand for vacations, said Jesse Rogers, an associate economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics based in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nFor Sonoma County, Rogers said, \"the outlook is even better.\"\n\nThe hospitality industry here has enjoyed eight years of steady growth. It ranks as the county\u2019s second-largest business sector, with $1.82 billion in spending in 2015, according to Visit California, the state\u2019s chief tourism organization.\n\nCounty hotel revenues have doubled since 2009, which was the hospitality sector\u2019s low point in the last recession. Hotel revenues last year rose 9.5 percent to $282.7 million, according to travel research firm STR, which surveys nearly 6,400 county hotel rooms, or roughly half the various types of lodging units here.\n\nThe county\u2019s average room rate rose 7 percent last year to $161.33, STR reported. Average occupancy increased to 77.6 percent from 75.9 percent in 2015. Both numbers were the highest in at least a decade.\n\nTravelers come here because they want to experience Wine Country. That includes visiting not only wineries but also restaurants and makers of craft beer, cheeses and other artisanal foods. And tourists want to get outdoors to cycle county back roads, swim in the Russian River, hike the wooded hills of state and regional parks and walk along coastal bluffs and beaches.\n\nEven last year\u2019s voter approval of an ordinance banning GMO crops is a draw for many travelers, Rogers said.\n\n\"I think it just points to the growing appeal of Sonoma as a bastion for organic\" and artisanal products, he said.\n\nAlong with drawing in visitors, the county in recent years has attracted airlines to fly new routes to and from the airport north of Santa Rosa.\n\nCommercial airline service resumed here in March 2007 with the arrival of Alaska Airlines subsidiary Horizon Air. Alaska now offers daily service from Santa Rosa to San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle.\n\nLast year, Alaska increased its number of total flights nearly 17 percent from a year earlier. In now offers seven flights a day, Stout said, and the airline this summer may add an extra daily flight to Portland and Seattle.\n\nLast spring, a second carrier, Allegiant, began flights to Las Vegas, plus a short-lived route to the Phoenix area, which ended earlier this month. The airline continues its twice-weekly service to Las Vegas.\n\nAnd on Feb. 16 American, the world\u2019s largest airline, will become the airport\u2019s third carrier when it begins daily service from here to Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport. Service will be aboard a Bombardier CRJ700, a regional aircraft that holds 70 passengers, including six in business class. The new route fits with American\u2019s strategy of linking regional airports to one of its nine hubs around the country, said spokeswoman Polly Tracey. In Phoenix, American employs 10,000 workers and carries about 20 million passengers a year through the airport. From there, travelers can take direct flights to Mexico, Costa Rica, Canada and cities around the U.S.\n\n\"You\u2019re not just starting a flight to Phoenix,\" Tracey said. \"You then have connections to places all around the world.\"\n\nPhoenix residents, meanwhile, will be attracted to the county \"because it\u2019s such a lovely leisure destination,\" she said.\n\nTo accommodate the new activity, the airport this week brought in a modular building that will serve as American\u2019s temporary check-in and baggage facility.\n\nA next step will occur this spring when a \"rigid-sided tent\" rises on the apron near the parked aircraft area, Stout said. The structure will have heating and air conditioning and initially will serve as a passenger waiting area, with gates leading to the aircraft.\n\nIn time, that tent structure will be expanded to accommodate check-in and baggage areas for some airlines, as well as the security screening area, Stout said. That will happen as the airport undertakes its $20 million terminal and parking expansion project.\n\nThe phased project could triple the terminal building to 45,000 square feet and add over 450 spaces in a second long-term parking area. The terminal design is expected to be completed and presented to the county Board of Supervisors around September, Stout said, with the project\u2019s completion slated for mid-2019.\n\nThe good times in hospitality also have prompted a surge in ne hotel projects. One of the biggest is the 200-room, $175 million hotel that opened last fall at the Graton Resort & Casino on the northwest edge of Rohnert Park.\n\n\"We expect to see continued robust hotel occupancy this year as new visitors to Graton Resort & Casino and existing casino guests experience our new hotel and spa offerings for the first time,\" general manager Joe Hasson said in an email. Staff members \"are already getting incredible feedback from guests who have stayed with us since debuting our hotel in November.\"\n\nHotel construction is underway in several cities, including Healdsburg, Windsor and Rohnert Park, where the 163-room Oxford Suites property already is taking reservations for June. The soon-to-be-completed hotel sits near the casino and across the street from Amy\u2019s Drive Thru on West Golf Course Drive.\n\nMore than two dozen other lodging projects have been proposed around the county. They include the planned transformation of the iconic Empire Building in downtown Santa Rosa\u2019s Old Courthouse Square into a 62-room hotel and the construction of a 132-room Cambria Hotel & Suites in Rohnert Park. Choice Hotels International of Rockville, Maryland, last week announced the latter project, which is slated to be built about a half-mile from the casino and open in 2019.\n\nTourism officials expect the county this year to once more host a number of events that draw large numbers of guests. The first such event comes Friday with the limited release of Pliny the Younger at Russian River Brewing Co. in downtown Santa Rosa. \n\nLast year, the two-week release of the world-famous beer drew more than 16,000 people to Russian River and generated nearly $5 million in economic activity, according to the county\u2019s Economic Development Board. Downtown Santa Rosa this year also will host two Ironman competitions, the 70.3 Vineman in May and a full-distance Ironman in late July. The latter includes a swim of 2.4 miles, a cycling segment of 112 miles and a run of 26.2 miles.\n\nThe Vineman previously had been held in Windsor. A spokesman for the Ironman organization said each competition should draw more than 5,000 visitors, and the newly renovated Old Courthouse Square will be an ideal location to host the events.\n\n\"The move of the event to downtown Santa Rosa provides the iconic finish for the athletes,\" Keats McGonigal, the group\u2019s senior regional director for North America, said in a statement.\n\nA question remains regarding how long the county\u2019s hospitality business can keep growing.\n\nThis year presents some relatively minor bumps in the road. They include the temporary closure of much of San Francisco\u2019s Moscone Center for renovation, a move that could decrease the number of conventiongoers coming to the Bay Area this year even as it increases competition by San Francisco hoteliers for smaller group gatherings, the same events Sonoma County typically seeks to attract.\n\nAlso, the strong dollar may continue to discourage international travel to the U.S., though California seems to be faring better in attracting foreign tourists than other parts of the country.\n\nNonetheless, there will be pressures to raise prices, officials said.\n\nFirst, the county\u2019s labor market \"is extraordinarily tight,\" Rogers said, which could cause hospitality business owners to raise wages to attract workers.\n\nSecond, many companies will be raising pay anyway in compliance with the state\u2019s minimum wage law.\n\nLynn Mohrfeld, president and CEO of the California Lodging and Hotel Association, told hotel operators in Santa Rosa last week that minimum wage hikes historically were one-time events, which then gave businesses several years in which to pass on costs to consumers. \n\nBut starting this year, the state is raising the minimum wage from 50 cents to $1 an hour every year until it reaches $15 an hour in 2022.\n\nThe next few years will still be strong for the hotel industry, Mohrfeld said after his speech to the annual meeting of the Sonoma County Lodging Association. But starting next year, occupancy rates may flatten even as the room rates continue to rise.\n\n\"I would say that this is probably going to be the high-water mark,\" he said.\n\nAs the hospitality industry has continued to grow, more county residents have raised concerns about its impacts. Some have complained about the effect of short-term vacation rentals on their neighborhoods. Others have opposed new winery tasting rooms and event centers because of the extra traffic and noise they bring to rural areas.\n\nHospitality officials are responding. The county lodging association revised its mission statement this year to call for the initiation of \"a vibrant exchange of ideas to ensure tourism\u2019s positive impact within Sonoma County.\"\n\nAnd Sonoma County Tourism, the county\u2019s main hospitality group, said it plans to increase community engagement efforts.\n\n\"The industry as a whole is mindful of the impacts of tourism on the local community,\" said Tim Zahner, the group\u2019s chief marketing officer. Part of the discussion will be to describe the positive impacts on the county, he said. But the community needs to see hospitality as a sustainable part of the county\u2019s economic and social life.\n\nAs such, he said, tourism officials will endeavor to speak with residents and \"hear more about what\u2019s going on and how we can assist.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ROBERT DIGITALE"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Hospitality industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Las Vegas news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"San Francisco Bay Area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Sonoma County hotels, airlines enjoy surge of visitors","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sonoma","zipCode":"95401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Rosa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Press Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660830","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Press Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pdpreps.com/","http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/","http://lists.northbaybusinessjournal.com/index.htm","http://www.biteclubeats.com/","http://www.celebratecommunity.org/","http://www.northbaycarsearch.com/","http://www.sonomanews.com/lifestyle/6584472-181/kenwood-restaurant-deal-crumbles?ref=most&artslide=0","http://www.capublicnotice.com/","http://www.pdmediasource.com/","http://santarosapressdemocrat.ca.newsmemory.com/ssindex.php"],"sequenceId":"695202785043","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=N$COcdFs4vHU$G_udhKLYc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvDCRZuomtGAARGOLJv84DRWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

My personal professional experience may help to place this in some context.\n\nI served for 30 years in the U.S. Foreign Service, from 1970 to 2000. During that time, my colleagues and I witnessed the transitions of six U.S. presidents and at least eight secretaries of state. I served at three embassies and two consulates on three continents. I worked with intelligence officers at every post, and I think it will be useful to offer a brief description of that function at a U.S. overseas mission.\n\nSimply stated, the purpose of intelligence gathering is to provide our government with as much information about foreign governments and their policies and intentions as possible. Contrary to some current perceptions, this cannot be done solely using technology. Bugs and drones cannot reveal intentions. Ultimately, there is no substitute for information provided by human beings in positions to provide it.\n\nHow this is attained is not just the stuff of Hollywood \u2014 and the end of the Cold War has not changed anything. In general, all national intelligence agencies function similarly. Foreign government officials, businessmen, academicians and media figures are all targets.\n\nI worked with CIA officers whose task was to identify host country nationals who were in positions, or who might attain positions later, in which they had information useful or vital to our national security. The process of identifying possible sources might take months, or years, but once identified as a likely source, a different officer, sent from Washington would make the \"pitch.\" Should the target refuse, he or she was thus not able to identify who initially identified him or her.\n\nDuring the Cold War, ideology was frequently the motivation for recruiting, but if the target was considered sufficiently important, money and other incentives would be offered. Creating a compromising situation could be used if necessary, and pure blackmail was the ultimate option. Such a trap could be initiated in a mundane fashion: dinner. Sports tickets. A bottle of Scotch. Even a small loan for a vacation. We were trained and expected to report even the most trivial contact.\n\nMarital problems and tax or financial issues were vulnerable areas, but the idea that any of the gifts were offered because \"they must like me\" would be greeted with scorn or hilarity. In the very rare event that one was compromised and sensitive information was requested, there were two obvious reactions: One was to roll over and submit to being used in hopes the material would never be used. The other was to deny the accusations and try to denigrate the source of the charges and demand that the source be revealed.\n\nRegarding sources, I\u2019m amazed at the reluctance to understand why such sources need to be protected and not made public. Revealing the source not only ends the source\u2019s usefulness and makes it more difficult to persuade others in the future, but it also reveals how the information was acquired. Even the legendary Enigma/Ultra code breakers allowed setbacks and even loss of life to protect a source that was so irreplaceable.\n\nIf any of this sets off alarm bells, it should. For a foreign intelligence officer, compromising a senior U.S. government official, let alone the head of state, would be considered a virtual fantasy. But what I have described above is the precise work that Vladimir Putin did for 30 years.\n\nDean Dizikes worked for three decades in the U.S. foreign service, serving in embassies in Germany, Iran and other countries.

The local Women\u2019s March on Jan. 21 was the most visible outcry, but there is much more evolving locally.\n\nWe will not be dragged back to our racist, homophobic, patriarchal past. We must continue to move forward, and we expect our elected representatives to join us.\n\nIf the rhetoric coming from Washington is to be believed, the people of this county will find themselves facing unjust laws that violate civil rights. And just as the colonists did, we must say, \"No!\"\n\nRecently, 70 people from all walks of life came together to craft a statement that would go to all of our county\u2019s elected representatives, letting them know that we expect them to protect all the people of Sonoma County.\n\nI grew up hearing people of all political persuasions say, \"Never again\" and \"How did the German people let this happen?\" In remembrance of 1930s Germany and what happened under the watch of the German people and their local governments, the statement is called \"It won\u2019t happen here.\"\n\nTo date, 114 civic organizations, faith communities and businesses have endorsed the \"It won\u2019t happen here\" statement. An online petition now includes the signatures of 1,300 people, and we haven\u2019t begun to count the paper petitions.\n\nThese are not normal times. We are certain that people, including our representatives, will make extraordinary efforts to be on the right side of history.\n\nThe immigrant community and others targeted by Donald Trump are bringing \"Welcoming Cities\" initiatives to Santa Rosa and the county. We have sent our declaration to Mayor Chris Coursey in support of the city\u2019s work. There are ongoing discussions with city councils around the county. The Santa Rosa School Board wrote its safe haven declaration after hearing from us and others.\n\nThe Sonoma County Commission on Human Rights wrote its \"Resolution in Support of the Protection of the Human and Constitutional Rights of All Members of the Sonoma County Community\" after reading our statement and a resolution passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. The commission members will now take it to the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors. We support rewritings which maintain the spirit of our statement.\n\nEarlier this month, the Community Advisory Council of the Independent Office of Law Enforcement Review and Outreach overwhelmingly endorsed the \"It won\u2019t happen here\" declaration and will send it to the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nWe are beginning to see how rapidly the Trump administration plans to undo the human rights gains of the past 50 years. That is unacceptable.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown has been defiant in defense of the people in California.

By 2020-21, payments to the California Public Employees Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System will eat up 20 percent of payroll dollars \u2014 about double the level in 2014-15.\n\nTo remain solvent, and to comply with a state law requiring school districts to maintain a reserve equal to 3 percent of general fund spending, Santa Rosa schools must make budget adjustments \u2014 that\u2019s a euphemism for spending cuts and/or tax increases \u2014 totaling $4 million for 2017-18 and $2 million more for 2018-19.\n\nAt that point, consultant Terry Ryland told the school board, \"we\u2019re still deficit spending, but it gets us down to where we meet our 3 percent reserve.\"\n\nThe district\u2019s financial situation was exacerbated by million-dollar accounting mistakes that apparently resulted in the departure of two top administrators in recent weeks.\n\nIt appears that the bookkeeping mistakes have been rectified, but the district hasn\u2019t credibly addressed its systemic problems.\n\nAfter listening to Ryland\u2019s Dec. 14 report, without comment on questions, and receiving a vague report from the special budget committee, which made suggestions including attracting more students and seeking a parcel tax, the board unanimously declared that it had met its legal obligation to adopt a sustainable spending plan.\n\nSonoma County school Superintendent Steve Herrington, whose responsibilities include oversight of school district budgets, grudgingly accepted that conclusion but warned Santa Rosa school officials that they need to be much more specific about their plans for erasing the deficit.\n\nIn 2014, Santa Rosa voters taxed themselves to pay for $229 million in capital improvements to local schools \u2014 money that cannot be used for day-to-day operations. At least one school board member is on record advocating a parcel tax to help balance the books. But the district\u2019s elected and appointed leaders will need to be far more forthcoming, and establish a more transparent process, if they expect voters to bail them out.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"San Francisco Bay Area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"PD Editorial: A brewing fiscal crisis for Santa Rosa schools","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sonoma","zipCode":"95401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Rosa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Press Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660830","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Press Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pdpreps.com/","http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/","http://lists.northbaybusinessjournal.com/index.htm","http://www.biteclubeats.com/","http://www.celebratecommunity.org/","http://www.northbaycarsearch.com/","http://www.capublicnotice.com/","http://www.pdmediasource.com/","http://santarosapressdemocrat.ca.newsmemory.com/ssindex.php"],"sequenceId":"695202786160","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=MeVzOcof3EEXUKnuAuGauc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYswTG6DQLvd7RRlZZRNnqXkWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

(JEFF SWENSEN / New York Times) (2 of ) Paul Krugman | Donald Trump will break most of his campaign promises. Which promises will he keep?\n\nThe answer, I suspect, has more to do with psychology than it does with strategy. Trump is much more enthusiastic about punishing people than he is about helping them. He may have promised not to cut Social Security and Medicare, or take health insurance away from the tens of millions who gained coverage under Obamacare, but in practice he seems perfectly willing to satisfy his party by destroying the safety net.\n\nOn the other hand, he appears serious about his eagerness to reverse America\u2019s 80-year-long commitment to expanding world trade. On Thursday, the White House said it was considering a 20 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico; doing so wouldn\u2019t just pull the U.S. out of NAFTA, it would violate all our trading agreements.\n\nWhy does he want this? Because he sees international trade the way he sees everything else: as a struggle for dominance, in which you only win at somebody else\u2019s expense.\n\nHis inaugural address made that perfectly clear: \"For many decades we\u2019ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry.\" And he sees punitive tariffs as a way to stop foreigners from selling us stuff, and thereby revive the \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.\"\n\nUnfortunately, as just about any economist could tell him \u2014 but probably not within his three-minute attention span \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work that way. Even if tariffs lead to a partial reversal of the long decline in manufacturing employment, they won\u2019t add jobs on net, just shift employment around. And they probably won\u2019t even do that: Taken together, the new regime\u2019s policies will probably lead to a faster, not slower, decline in American manufacturing.\n\nHow do we know this? We can look at the underlying economic logic, and we can also look at what happened during the Reagan years, which in some ways represent a dress rehearsal for what\u2019s coming.\n\nNow, I\u2019m talking about the reality of Reagan, not the Republicans\u2019 legend, which assigns all blame for the early-1980s recession to Jimmy Carter and all credit for the subsequent recovery to the sainted Ronald. In fact, that whole cycle had almost nothing to do with Reagan policies.\n\nWhat Reagan did do, however, was blow up the budget deficit with military spending and tax cuts. This drove up interest rates, which drew in foreign capital. The inflow of capital, in turn, led to a stronger dollar, which made U.S. manufacturing uncompetitive. The trade deficit soared \u2014 and the long-term decline in the share of manufacturing in overall employment accelerated sharply.\n\nNotably, it was under Reagan that talk of \"deindustrialization\" and the use of the term \"Rust Belt\" first became widespread.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that the Reagan-era manufacturing decline took place despite a significant amount of protectionism, especially a quota on Japanese car exports to the United States that ended up costing consumers more than $30 billion in today\u2019s prices.\n\nWill we repeat this story? The Trump regime will clearly blow up the deficit, mainly through tax cuts for the rich. (Funny, isn\u2019t it, how all the deficit scolds have gone quiet?) True, this may not boost spending very much, since the rich will save much of their windfall while the poor and the middle class will face harsh benefits cuts. Still, interest rates have risen in anticipation of the borrowing surge, and so has the dollar. So we do seem to be following the Reagan playbook for shrinking manufacturing. It\u2019s true that Trump appears ready to practice a much more extreme form of protectionism than Reagan, who avoided outright violations of existing trade deals. This could help some manufacturing industries. But it will also drive the dollar higher, hurting others.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a further factor to consider: The world economy has gotten a lot more complex over the past three decades. These days, hardly anything is simply \"made in America,\" or for that matter \"made in China\": Manufacturing is a global enterprise, in which cars, planes and so on are assembled from components produced in multiple countries.\n\nWhat will happen to this enterprise if the United States takes a meat ax to the agreements that govern international trade? There will, inevitably, be huge dislocation: Some U.S. factories and communities will benefit, but others will be hurt, bigly, by the loss of markets, crucial components or both.\n\nEconomists talk about the \"China shock,\" the disruption of some communities by surging Chinese exports in the 2000s. Well, the coming Trump shock will be at least as disruptive.\n\nAnd the biggest losers, as with health care, will be white working-class voters who were foolish enough to believe that Donald Trump was on their side.\n\nPaul Krugman is a columnist for the New York Times.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"PAUL KRUGMAN"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Krugman: Making the Rust Belt rustier","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sonoma","zipCode":"95401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Rosa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Press Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660830","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Press Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pdpreps.com/","http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/","http://lists.northbaybusinessjournal.com/index.htm","http://www.biteclubeats.com/","http://www.celebratecommunity.org/","http://www.northbaycarsearch.com/","http://www.capublicnotice.com/","http://www.pdmediasource.com/","http://santarosapressdemocrat.ca.newsmemory.com/ssindex.php"],"sequenceId":"695202786429","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=yqi7mHeCuzSmUVOjc5JaeM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvJ6mWi8QgaIcoNxez8bx3EWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

She replied, \"yes the (expletive) it is a gas you ignorant (expletive). sarin is a liquid & can evaporate \u2026 shut the (expletive) up.\"\n\nTom Nichols, professor at the U.S. Naval War College and the Harvard Extension School, writing in the Chronicle Review, says such a \"storm of outraged ego\" is an increasingly common phenomenon among students who, having been taught to regard themselves as peers of their teachers, \"take correction as an insult.\" Nichols relates this to myriad intellectual viruses thriving in academia. Carried by undereducated graduates, these viruses infect the nation\u2019s civic culture.\n\nSoon the results include the presidential megaphone being used to amplify facially preposterous assertions, e.g., that upward of 5 million illegal votes were cast in 2016. A presidential minion thinks this assertion is justified because it is the president\u2019s \"long-standing belief.\"\n\n\"College, in an earlier time,\" Nichols writes, \"was supposed to be an uncomfortable experience because growth is always a challenge,\" replacing youthful simplicities with adult complexities. Today, college involves the \"pampering of students as customers,\" particularly by grade inflation in a context of declining academic rigor: A recent study showed \"A\" to be the most commonly awarded grade, 30 percent more frequent than in 1960. And a 2011 University of Chicago study found that 45 percent of students said that in the previous semester none of their courses required more than 20 pages of writing and 32 percent had no class that required more than 40 pages of reading in a week.\n\n\"Unearned praise and hollow successes,\" Nichols says, \"build a fragile arrogance in students that can lead them to lash out at the first teacher or employer who dispels that illusion, a habit that carries over into a resistance to believe anything inconvenient or challenging in adulthood.\" A habit no doubt intensified when adults in high places speak breezily of \"alternative facts.\"\n\n\"Rather than disabuse students of their intellectual solipsism,\" Nichols says, \"the modern university reinforces it,\" producing students given to \"taking offense at everything while believing anything.\" Many colleges and universities, competing for tuition dollars \"too often drawn thoughtlessly from an inexhaustible well of loans,\" market a \"college experience\" rather than an education. The experience \"turns into five and, increasingly, six (years).\" Nichols notes that \"the fragility of 21st-century students\" results from \"the swaddling environment of the modern university\" that \"infantilizes students\" who demand \"trigger warnings\" and \"safe spaces.\"\n\nMuch attention has been given to the non-college-educated voters who rallied to Trump. Insufficient attention is given to the role of the college miseducated. They, too, are complicit in our current condition because they emerged from their expensive \"college experiences\" neither disposed nor able to conduct civil, informed arguments. They are thus disarmed when confronted by political people who consider evidence, data and reasoning to be mere conveniences and optional.\n\nFor all the talk in high places about emancipating the many from \"the elites,\" political philosopher Walter Berns was right: The question always is not whether elites will govern but which elites will. And a republic\u2019s challenge is to increase the likelihood that the many will consent to governance by worthy elites. So, how is our republic doing? What is most alarming about the president and his accomplices in the dissemination of factoids is not that they do not know this or that. And it is not that they do not know what they do not know. Rather, it is that they do not know what it is to know something.\n\nThe republican form of government rests on representation: The people do not decide issues, they decide who will decide. Who, that is, will conduct the deliberations that \"refine and enlarge\" public opinion (Madison, Federalist 10).

Maybe they\u2019re being polite, maybe they worry Trump will do something to cause them to regret their votes, maybe they didn\u2019t vote for him. I don\u2019t know. \n\nIf we\u2019re cautioned not to discuss religion or politics in polite company during normal times, what do we do in the age of President Trump? Nice weather we\u2019re having today. \n\nIn Sonoma County, of course, Republicans are outnumbered. Only 1 in 5 local voters cast a vote for Trump in November. More people are registered as decline-to-state than are registered as Republicans.\n\nLast week\u2019s anti-Trump march in Santa Rosa, perhaps the biggest political demonstration ever in Sonoma County, testifies to the widespread fear and anxiety among Democrats \u2014 not to mention a palpable sense of disbelief. \n\nPolitical views aside, Democrats remain flummoxed by the idea that millions of Americans would vote for a person who has so many unredeeming qualities. \n\nIn social settings and business meetings, too, have you noticed that people are reluctant to speak his name until they can\u2019t stand it any longer? Then the same questions come spilling out: Is it OK to talk about this here? How could this happen? What do we do now?\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that we are only having this conversation because a relative handful of voters in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania didn\u2019t vote or switched from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump to 2016. In a divided country, small shifts in the electorate can cause dramatic changes in the way the country is governed, and if you don\u2019t believe it, you\u2019re not paying attention. \n\nDespite all the hand wringing, we know a lot about the majority of Trump voters. \n\nThey tend to be older, white and male. Many have voted for Republicans for their entire lives, just as their parents before them and their parents before them. \n\nMost Trump voters don\u2019t live in big cities. Only 1 in 10 voters in Manhattan voted for him, and only 1 in 10 in San Francisco, too. Trump won Texas, but Hillary Clinton won Dallas and Houston.\n\nTrump voters subscribe to what might be called the new Republican orthodoxy. \n\nThey don\u2019t like the way the country is changing, whether the changes involve immigration, social programs, abortion, identity politics, regulation or corporate efforts to control costs (and prices) by offshoring jobs. \n\nThey blame politicians, and they want the government run by politicians to be turned upside-down.\n\nYou know the rest. \n\nThey think they pay too much in taxes. They want to roll back laws intended to protect health, safety and the environment (laws they view as wasteful and ineffective). They distrust efforts intended to level the playing field for women and minorities. \n\nSome also believe a smaller government should still find the resources to round up and deport 11 million people. Some believe iPhones can be made in Petaluma (never mind that a minimum wage worker in California is paid three times what a worker in an iPhone factory in China is paid). If Democrats don\u2019t understand what Trump voters could be thinking, the same could be said for Republicans who could never imagine voting for Hillary Clinton. \n\nTo avoid dealing with some of Trump\u2019s more incendiary statements, Trump voters say they \"take him seriously but not literally.\" In the coming months, they will find out whether their trust was justified.\n\nAll these are generalizations, of course. People carry around different combinations of reasons for voting the way they vote. But most of the Republican voters I know would agree with most of these characterizations. Many would also agree that while they voted for Trump, they worry about what happens now.\n\nOh, and one more thing: Trump supporters share the conviction that their critics in places like California and New York can be condescending jerks. This is important, I think. There is no reason to be surprised that people don\u2019t like being called all the names \u2014 racist, xenophobe, sexist, homophobe, deplorables \u2014 that have been thrown at Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nIn a 2014 column, after exploring the Central Valley and eastern California, I wrote this:\n\n\"There is a sense of isolation in these towns, not just physical isolation, but economic and political isolation as well. Some choose to live here to escape the hustle, hype and conformity of urban areas.\n\n\"But there\u2019s also a belief that their values aren\u2019t shared by other Californians \u2014 a belief that government is denying to them the right to live as they choose.\"\n\nFrom Bakersfield to Alturas, no one should be surprised that these were the areas of California that voted for Trump. This was their opportunity for vindication and for pay-back \u2014 and they grabbed it.\n\nSurveying the distance between Santa Rosa and Bakersfield, we are reminded again that there are two Americas now \u2014 one prosperous, one less so \u2014 each with very different ideas about the present and the future.\n\nPete Golis is a columnist for The Press Democrat.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

She has been with DATAMARK for 17 years, starting her career with the company in 2000 as a software developer. \n\n\"Nina's long track record of success in delivering business process improvement solutions to our clients will be an asset in her new role as VP of Sales and Marketing,\" said DATAMARK President Bill Randag. \"Nina's experience as a technical sales specialist and her deep understanding of the roles that people, process and technology play in business process management make her the ideal candidate for this position.\" \n\nBrown assumes the role of VP of Sales and Marketing during an exciting time of growth and expansion for DATAMARK. As a result of this recent growth, DATAMARK recently announced the opening of a second service delivery center in India, located in the country's financial and commercial center of Mumbai. DATAMARK's service footprint currently extends across multiple locations in the U.S., Mexico and India. \n\nAfter joining DATAMARK in 2000, Brown played an active role in leading software development projects for clients in the financial services, insurance and healthcare payer sectors, helping achieve new levels of process efficiency and cost savings. Brown later took on significant roles as a project manager, leading large-scale BPO transitions, including the launch of new consolidated mailroom services for a prominent leader in the banking industry in 2006. She then continued to partner with Sales and Marketing to expand partnerships, services, and locations and was instrumental in driving initiatives which led to over $15 million in new revenue for DATAMARK, including the expansion of a partnership in 2010 with a Fortune 100 financial services client, yielding the opening of a new domestic operational facility. \n\nIn 2012, Brown established DATAMARK's Business Engineering Department, to serve as a team of technical sales specialists for the company, and also introduced Consulting as a new service in the company portfolio. In this capacity, she and her Engineering department were involved in engagements which led to multiple new client partnerships as well as significant incremental revenue increases over the years.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

She was originally scheduled to headline last year\u2019s festival but had to pull out due to an illness. \n \nInitially founded as \u201cthe Newport Jazz Festival at Saratoga\u201d the weekend event was renamed Freihofer\u2019s Saratoga Jazz Festival in 1998. \n \nThe 2017 Freihofer\u2019s Saratoga Jazz Festival features a major lineup of musicians, ranging from emerging artists making their festival debuts, to the return of two legendary musicians who performed on the inaugural 1978 festival, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Jean Luc-Ponty. \n \n \nThis year also marks the centennial of the first recorded jazz album and the first commercial use of the word \u201cjazz,\u201d when the Original Dixieland Jazz Band recorded their New Orleans rooted music at Victor Talking Machine. The recording was an instantaneous success, ushering in a new era of popular music, the \u201cJazz Age.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe 2017 40th anniversary Freihofer\u2019s Saratoga Jazz Festival will be an extraordinary tribute to the history of our festival and to the future of jazz music,\u201d said SPAC President and CEO Elizabeth Sobol. \u201cFor four decades our festival has played a critical role as an incubator of the up-and-coming stars of tomorrow. Artists like Dee Dee Bridgewater, Jean-Luc Ponty and Jack DeJohnette established Saratoga\u2019s premier place amongst the great American jazz festivals. Likewise, today\u2019s young artists Cory Henry, Jacob Collier, and Cécile McLorin Salvant are the future of jazz. Forty years from now, we will look back with a sense of the great fortune we have to experience their current work on the magnificent SPAC stage.\u201d \n \nDanny Melnick, the festival producer and president of Absolutely Live Entertainment, said the festival \u201ccontinues to be in a powerful position to honor the musicians who\u2019ve given us the rich legacy of jazz heritage, and to present a new and diverse generation of artists and visionaries who embody a community that\u2019s both a life force for new ideas and social change.\u201d \n \nBelow is a look at who will be performing where during the two-day festival \n Saturday Main Stage  \n\u2022 Khan, a ten-time Grammy Award winner best known for hits \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t Nobody,\u201d returns to SPAC for the first time in 20 years.

She hopes her long road to recovery and ability to walk again can be motivation for others.\n\nWest has three sons, ages seven, eight and twelve. She can't wait to stand on the sidelines at their football games and go inside the dugout at their baseball games. She also wants to go for walks on the beach with her husband, Justin.\n\nShe can do all of those things now, thanks to new prostheses. She recently spent two weeks in New York adjusting to her new prosthetic legs and arm with the help of \u201cA Step Ahead Prosthetics.\u201d\n\nThe company has offices in New York, Boston, and a facility in Israel and designs and fits customized prostheses. They have developed specializations in prosthetic socket design for lower extremity and upper extremity amputees, pediatric and congenital anomalies, customized sports prosthetics, bionic prosthetics and custom silicone skin coverings.\n\n\u201cThey built me a set of brand new, top-of-the-line legs and knees and an amazing hand that I didn't even realize I was getting. And I'm walking! It's pretty huge,\u201d West said. \u201cThese are $220,000 legs. They\u2019re carbon fiber so they\u2019re super light. They put glitter in mine and every southern girl needs a monogram. I get to wear more than one ring now so I was excited about that.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cBelieve\u201d is printed on the side of her new left leg- her motto since she was scalded with boiling water more than five years ago at her Montgomery home.\n\nOn December 30, 2011, she put a large pot of collards on the stove to boil. Her uncle was living with Crumpton West and her family at that time and in a rage, he threw the boiling water on her. She sustained third-degree burns on her right arm, chest, and legs, and second-degree burns on the left side of her face and left arm.\n\nHer burns were severe and the drugs used to treat her cut off the circulation to her extremities, forcing doctors to amputate her legs and right arm.\n\nCrumpton West has had more than 220 surgeries since then and her medical bills exceeded $1 million.\n\n\u201cFive minutes of anger changed the course of my life, but I'm back on the road now,\u201d she said.\n\nIn New York, she met other female patients and they were able to provide each other with advice and support. She has visited local hospitals in the past to provide words of encouragement to other amputees and looks forward to mentoring more people dealing with similar situations.\n\nThe work to balance and take steps with her new legs has been painful, but Crumpton West says it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\u201cI'm using muscles I haven't used in several years,\u201d she said. \u201cI can't say it's easy, but it'll get easier and I'm not going to complain.\u201d\n\nNow, she's embracing the ability to once again do simple tasks.\n\n\u201cThe things that you take for granted, like being able to open a trash bag or tie a shoe string or hold hands- I got that back,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I got back from New York, I walked in and my youngest son grabbed my hand and walked beside me.\u201d\n\nShe hopes her journey inspires other amputees and those dealing with traumatic injuries, as well as her children.\n\n\u201cI want to teach them not to ever give up. That's the biggest lesson, not to give up, no matter what,\u201d she said.\n\nBrian Crumpton, Jessica's uncle, was convicted of assault in the incident that left her with second and third-degree burns.\n\nIn September 2012, he was sentenced to five years in prison, followed by five years on probation.\n\nHe was released from prison in June 2014 and court officials tell us he on probation until September 2017.\n\n\u201cThat day took too much from me already and I would be a fool to let it take any more time from me,\u201d Crumpton West said.\n\n\u201cA Step Ahead Prosthetics\u201d applauded her determination on Facebook, sharing videos and photos of her on their page.\n\n\u201cWe're so amazed by her attitude and contagious personality,\u201d the company stated.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Lindsey Rogers"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Montgomery burn victim walking again with new prostheses","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Potter","zipCode":"79105","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Amarillo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"NewsChannel 10","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"557360183","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7068"},"name":"NewsChannel 10","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newschannel10.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.wsfa.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202799070","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T04:41:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://WSFA.images.worldnow.com/images/13008607_G.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202800429","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n \nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n \nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n \nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n \nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n \nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half. \n \n(c)2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \n \nVisit the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at www.jsonline.com \n \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Arca Max","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612804360","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Arca Max","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arcamax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202800750","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Terry Branstad \u2013 who created the in 2013 \u2013 and Republican leadership in the Iowa House and Senate would cut the group\u2019s funding by $75,000.\n\nOver the course of a year, that figure represents a 21.6 percent cut from the board\u2019s annual budget of $348,000. But that cut constitutes more than half of its operating budget through the end of the fiscal year this June.\n\nSuch a move would be a disaster for all Iowans.\n\nThe IPIB has the power that is almost unique among the states to order compliance with open meetings and open records laws, the board in the vast majority of cases is able to resolve complaints informally, and without either side having to hire a lawyer or go to court.\n\nBut anyone who thinks that this is a minor agency that doesn\u2019t apply to them couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Its three-person staff processed 875 cases in 2016 alone \u2013 a significant increase year over year and many times over more cases than anticipated when the board was formed.\n\nIn particular, many bodies in southwest Iowa have kept the board busy in recent years.\n\nThe most notable local case the board handled came from the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. Just last month, a state court upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling that held its three members personally liable for violating open meeting laws in 2013.\n\nCity councils in both Council Bluffs and Pacific Junction have reached mediation agreements with the board in recent years regarding allegations of violations \u2013 but the state board goes far beyond that.\n\nWithin the last three years, complaints centering around a hospital in Denison, the school board in Red Oak and the public library in Atlantic have all been funneled to the IPIB.\n\nSome were dismissed; others spurred corrective action \u2013 but all cases involved the board striving to ensure Iowans had access to transparent, open government and other nonelected bodies.\n\nNow, more than ever, access and transparency are vital cornerstones for democracy. \u201cFake news\u201d and \u201calternative facts\u201d have entered the lexicon and spread like wildfire online \u2013 but truth and openness remain the best weapon to inform and educate the public.\n\nIn short, the board meets a vital demand by Iowans \u2013 citizens, state and local government officials and members of the news media \u2013 for fast and cost-free resolution of questions and complaints about public access to records and meetings of state and local governments.\n\nThe people of Iowa have a right to know how their state and local tax dollars are spent and what is being done in their interest by the public officials they elect.\n\nThat right to know is a hollow promise without vigorous enforcement of Iowa\u2019s public meetings and public records laws. But it would in fact be a hollow promise if the Legislature acts to cripple the .

Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bibb","zipCode":"31201","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Macon","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macon Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659292","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"56"},"name":"Macon Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macon.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202803630","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

From year to year, temperatures may cycle from hotter to cooler and back again. The bad news, however, is that without serious cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, the world will get much warmer over the long term. There\u2019s widespread consensus that over the course of the 21st century, unchecked global warming will disrupt agriculture, flood cities and drive species to extinction.\n\nFocusing on record-breaking years alone can be misleading. It means throwing away the bulk of your data, said statistical physicist Sidney Redner of the Santa Fe Institute. Looking at systematic long-term trends, he said, \"is the more kosher way to do things.\"\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fool yourself or others by zeroing in on a small piece of data. In the early 2000s, some people isolated the relatively cool years following big spikes in 1997 and 1998 and wrongly concluded that global warming had stopped. That\u2019s like a person who gains 50 pounds over a decade claiming the trend has reversed because he lost a pound between Feb. 3 and Feb. 4. Unsurprisingly, claims about \"the pause\" were more popular among politicians than among scientists. Taken as a whole, the data show a clear warming trend over the last few decades.\n\nStill, an impressive number of record years have been piling up in the 21st century, with 16 of the 17 hottest years on record having occurred since 2000. What, if anything, does this mean? Two years ago, the Associated Press generated some controversy by quoting a statistician who claimed that the odds were only one in 650 million that without man-made global warming we\u2019d have observed what was then nine of the 10 hottest years on record having occurred since 2000. Climatologists say the odds such a streak are not quite that low, because yearly variations in global temperature aren\u2019t independent, like coin tosses, but tend to cluster. A hot year is more likely to be followed by another hot year than a cool one.\n\nOne reason hot years tend to clump together is a semi-periodic oscillation of ocean currents known as El Niño, and its cooler counterpart, La Niña. This cycle happens because heat from the sun doesn\u2019t warm the earth\u2019s oceans uniformly. Trade winds tend to allow a blob of warm water to build up in the tropical Pacific every few years. Once the heat builds past a certain point, it breaks free, sending ocean currents into a different pattern. Warmer water moves from the deep ocean toward the surface, where it releases heat into the atmosphere. Rainfall patterns change and global atmospheric temperatures spike. (Fishermen in Peru named the phenomenon El Niño \u2014 after the Christ child \u2014 because they noticed that unusually warm currents would periodically come around Christmas.)\n\nThe cycle normally produces an El Niño condition every three to seven years, said Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. But every once in a while there\u2019s a more dramatic oscillation \u2014 what he calls a \"super El Niño.\" One occurred in the early 1980s, then again from 1997 through 1998, and most recently in the period spanning 2014, 2015 and 2016 \u2014 our recent triple record-breaker. Whether these super El Niños are natural phenomena or are connected to man-made global warming remains an area of investigation. The result is that instead of a steady increase in temperatures, we see periods of relatively little warming followed by spikes \u2014 but with a long-term upward trend. That still leaves the question of what\u2019s causing the trend. Variations in solar output and volcanic eruptions can cause the global climate to heat and cool, but volcanologists and solar physicists report no changes that would account for rising temperatures measured over recent decades.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence bolster the case that human-generated greenhouse gases are to blame, said Benjamin Santer, a climatologist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Back in the 1960s, Princeton University meteorologist Syukuro Manabe predicted that global warming caused by changes in the sun would create different patterns of heat in the atmosphere than would global warming from greenhouse-gas buildup. If the sun were the culprit, Santer explained, it would heat the atmosphere from the top down, distributing the extra heat uniformly. If greenhouse gases were to blame, the lower part of the atmosphere would absorb more heat, leaving the upper atmosphere cooler.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t something scientists could test in the 1960s, Santer said, but with data from satellites and modern weather balloons, he and colleagues recently observed the signature of greenhouse gas warming that Manabe predicted.\n\nThe theory of carbon dioxide warming is also backed by basic physics. Tabletop experiments show that carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation, while oxygen and nitrogen do not. While carbon dioxide makes up just a trace of the atmosphere, it\u2019s responsible for keeping the planet from freezing into a giant snowball.\n\nThe current spate of records, said Santer, is exactly what the scientists expected to see, given what they know about greenhouse-gas warming and the El Niño cycle. Last year, climatologist Michael Mann decided to calculate the odds of getting 13 of the 15 hottest years on record occurring since 2000 if natural forces were acting alone. His conclusion: around one in 10,000 \u2014 not as slim as what AP reported, but not exactly odds you\u2019d want to bet the future on.\n\nFaye Flam is a columnist for Bloomberg View columnist.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"FAYE FLAM"},"topics":[{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Even three scorching years don't make a trend","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sonoma","zipCode":"95401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Rosa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Press Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660830","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Press Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pdpreps.com/","http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/","http://lists.northbaybusinessjournal.com/index.htm","http://www.biteclubeats.com/","http://www.celebratecommunity.org/","http://www.northbaycarsearch.com/","http://www.capublicnotice.com/","http://www.pdmediasource.com/","http://santarosapressdemocrat.ca.newsmemory.com/ssindex.php"],"sequenceId":"695202806649","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=bjVyxeO2YBj6r1XIVI1eaM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYusA2RPWvCKNm_cuEVaXIBmWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

It seems to be a form of bullying to discredit journalists with stellar reputations. This behavior needs to be challenged, and the truth must be told.\n\nThursday\u2019s editorial was also spot-on about the muzzling of government agencies. It is shocking to me that data, facts and science are treated with such disrespect.\n\nWe are fortunate that there are brave men and women in the National Park Service, NASA and the EPA who are speaking out on alternative social media to get the truth out for the public.\n\nIt\u2019s my opinion that our freedom of speech and democracy are at risk. I am especially concerned about our environment. We the people deserve access to clean water and clean air. If the EPA budget is cut as is speculated, we are in imminent danger.\n\nThank you for the work you do. I am grateful for newspaper journalists who are doing such a good job in being truth tellers. As a result of this election, we now have paid subscriptions to four newspapers and are thinking of adding one more.\n\nMarie Larchick, Council Bluffs\n\nSteps must be taken to return religious freedoms to citizens\n\nFirst of all, I suggest that things be put in their proper perspective by looking at America\u2019s determination to fight for patriotic principles of integrity and truth.\n\nHas it not been obvious that there is an ongoing reaction to the liberal media\u2019s desire to force their views, as well as the government\u2019s on America and the world?\n\nAs a newspaper reporter in 2007-08, during the campaign for president and the beginning of the Obama presidency, I was more aware than many that within a few weeks of the transition of power, and of winning the Senate, Mitch McConnell set forth a budget that gave Obama, Reid, and Pelosi everything they wanted.\n\nThis was an obvious betrayal and caused a revolt at the grassroots level.\n\nOur newly inaugurated president, Donald Trump, was obviously aware of that grassroots revolution and ran his campaign on an agenda pledging to enact a whole range of policy changes that would turn Washington upside down, \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201d\n\nAnd to this ex-Vietnam veteran, who now has renewed hope for America, the expulsion of an oppressive federal government is acceptable, no matter what the liberal media continues to feed and mislead the people by saying.\n\nI am one of many who have felt as though, over the last eight years, we have had to endure someone taking a sledgehammer to our faith, family, and freedom.\n\nWe have been threatened with possible punishment and even financial ruin if we dared to show dissent based on religious beliefs. Bills signed into law by a single man sitting in an oval office put Christians, in business, the military and in ministry, on the wrong side of the law if they dared to speak up.\n\nSo what needs to be done?\n\nFirst, to restore our freedom of speech and beliefs, gut the Johnson Amendment, which the \u201cfar left\u201d has used in an attempt to silence Christians. Second, stop policies signed by the ex-president that has allowed the military to push a far-left social agenda.\n\nThird, overturn the bathroom mandate that has forced schools to allow males to invade our daughters\u2019 and granddaughters\u2019 school restrooms and locker rooms (I feel strongly about this because I have four daughters and five granddaughters).\n\nAnd fourth, nominate and confirm a U.S. Supreme Court justice who will help turn around the court\u2019s growing judicial dictatorship and return our religious freedoms to us.\n\nIn sharing what I have, I feel we are going to become a country again that protects the freedoms our forefathers fought so hard for. God bless America and our new leaders.\n\nAllen Stark, Council Bluffs\n\n\u2018The next time you need help, don\u2019t call on us\u2019\n\nWhat started as a prank by a group of five high school students ended up destroying the life of the Rev. Paul Monahan. I\u2019m sure they were welcomed as heroes in their homes and churches.\n\nMy father served in World War I from the very first to the very last, winning numerous medals. My brother-in-law served in the Navy and my father-in-law served in the Marines in World War II. Another brother-in-law fought and froze many long months in Korea.\n\nI served as a combat medic in Vietnam. I spent 14 months dragging men out of harm\u2019s way. I, gratefully, was given a few awards, including the Bronze Star. My nephew served two tours of duty in Iraq with the Marines.\n\nMy point to all of this is that we didn\u2019t put in all this hard work only to have our religious freedom trampled on by a few youth who have never had to spend five minutes serving their country in any capacity.\n\nThe next time you need help, don\u2019t call on us.\n\nJerry Sievers, Council Bluffs","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Your Views: \u2018Our freedom of speech and democracy are at risk'; Steps must be taken to return religious freedoms to citizens; \u2018The next time you need help, don\u2019t call on us\u2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pottawattamie","zipCode":"51503","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Council Bluffs","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Nonpareil","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169686742","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Daily Nonpareil","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.southwestiowanews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202808281","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nonpareilonline.com/content/tncms/custom/image/9c9056c2-be31-11e6-8502-132717da669c.jpg?_dc=1481303097"}],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released.

Because when a young Kanika Kapoor found her world in sheer disharmony, it helped her not only heal but also carve an identity that she\u2019s proud of today. Her much enjoyed peppy renditions like Baby doll (Ragini MMS), Lovely and Kamlee (Happy New Year), Chittiyaan kalaiyaan (Roy), Premika (Dilwale) and the recent Da da dasse (Udta Punjab) and Beat pe booty (A Flying Jatt) celebrate her effervescence giving no hint about the turmoil she\u2019s been through. And that only validates her talent. \n \n\nIt was a fairytale life for young Kanika when she married businessman Raj Chandok in 1997 at the age of 18 and moved to London. They went on to have three children. Life was all about diamonds, yacht parties and loads of bitching sessions with rich but bored wives. \u201cI had everything at my disposal - from private planes to yachts to the choicest brands,\u201d she recalls adding, \u201cBut I was terribly unhappy. I had diamonds galore but there was no love, no respect. I was miserable in the marriage,\u201d she recalls. Like most women, she didn\u2019t have the guts to walk away from what seemed a secure situation. Above all, she had children. \u201cI was dependant financially on my husband. My biggest fear were the kids \u2013 where would I go with them?\u201d she shares. \u201cWomen waste a lot of time sulking and in self-pity. They need to get up and get out of that,\u201d says the singer who divorced her husband in 2012. \nAs they say it\u2019s darkest before dawn. And Kanika found herself emerging out of the abyss. \u201cThere comes a moment in your life where you feel nothing is working out for you, your life is hell,\u201d she says. \u201cJust then someone advised me to take up music once more and that became the turning point,\u201d says the graduate in music, who\u2019s also studied classical music under musician Pandit Ganesh Prasad Mishra from Varanasi.  She went ahead to record a song and released it on internet. \u201cA year later, I got a call from Ekta Kapoor, saying she liked my voice and asking me to fly down to Mumbai and record with Meet Bros Anjjan. The breakthrough seems miraculous\u2026\u201d she traces how Baby doll for Ragini MMS 2 happened.  The number filmed on Sunny Leone even won her the Filmfare Best Playback (Female) Award. And since then the music has not stopped playing in her life. \n   \n2 /3 \n  All Comments (0)    With children Aayana, Yuvraj and Samara  \nWhat few know about is her full-fledged fashion career before she came to India. She\u2019s been close to all the international fashion houses given her brush with hi-society. Recently, she even hosted a dinner for Italian fashion designer Stefano Gabbana. \u201cWhen in London I was a special customer for all the big brands. They used to invite me for their shows. I even walked the ramp for Alberta Ferretti, Demi Couture at the Milan Fashion Week. After all, I was married to a wealthy man. So all I did was spend, lunch and bitch,\u201d laughs Kanika. Today, she doesn\u2019t miss the lavish lifestyle she once enjoyed. \u201cI\u2019m happy and content. I believe happiness lies within you. You can have the world at your feet and yet be the unhappiest person because of your state of mind,\u201d she declares. \u201cI don\u2019t need a rich husband. I\u2019m ready to live with less. I don\u2019t wear Dolce and Gabbana anymore. I buy Zara and I look okay,\u201d she smiles. \n \n\nShe\u2019s friends with her ex-husband Raj now. In fact, he\u2019s happy for her success. \u201cWhen he heard my songs, he told me, \u2018Well done, I\u2019m always there for you\u2019,\u201d she laughs adding, \u201cI\u2019ve learnt that in good times everyone is your friend. There are few who are by your side duirng hard times. And that support is all that matters in those times.\u201d \nThankfully, pain has not left her bitter. Rather, it\u2019s made her more compassionate, more sensitive to others. It\u2019s also given her an all-embracing perspective. \u201cI\u2019d never want anyone to experience pain and discomfort because of me. I\u2019d never want to cheat anybody.... I don\u2019t have a feeling of competition or jealousy towards anyone either. You have to be happy in your own skin,\u201d she states. Merely two years into the business but Kanika has made a mark in the music world. Shares she, \u201cI want to do quality work. So far, I\u2019ve been doing songs that are commercial. Now that will change. I want to explore further. It could be with a new filmmaker or even a small- budget film,\u201d she informs. \u201cThanks to my classical training, I can mould my voice and style. I can sing a song like Baby doll to a Chhil gaye naina (NH10) to a Da da dasse (Udta Punjab),\u201d she says adding, \u201cI love old songs like Jao re jogi tum jaore (Amrapali). There\u2019s beauty in old school music. I want to explore my voice in that realm.\u201d She insists she has poured her experiences in her music. \u201cIt comes from my journey. My trauma has made me mature. It\u2019s also made me spiritual. That makes me different from other singers. For instance, Yeh duniya pittal di from Baby doll has a special impact. It has come from my soul,\u201d she explains. \n   \n3 /3 \n  All Comments (0)    \nThe singer has begun doing independent music though she has been advised otherwise. \u201cMy first song ever, Jugni Ji was an independent music video. People recognise internationally because of Jugni Ji, be it Arabs, Moroccans or the Spanish. I\u2019m now doing a French collaboration only because of Jugni Ji. Maybe India knows me with Baby doll but Jugni Ji is the biggest song in the world for me.\u201d  She also enjoys doing stage shows. In fact, her last show in Dallas was a sold out. \u201cThirty five thousand people were shouting my name in unison. I was feeding on their energy and giving my best. It\u2019s humbling to see people love you so much. It has transformed me as a person,\u201d she says. She confides it\u2019s only through time that she has developed this confidence on stage. \u201cMy first performance was with Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone in Abu Dhabi for an IPL concert. I was trembling on stage; I didn\u2019t know how to perform. And when I came down someone said it on my face, \u2018That was a shit performance.\u2019 I just burst out in tears,\u201d she recalls the embarrassing memory. \n\nShe\u2019s not overwhelmed by the glamour world and is aware of the not-so-congenial side as well. \u201cThis is not a very welcoming industry be it for an actor or a singer. Initially, people regarded me as a \u2018one song wonder.\u2019 I\u2019m not a misfit but I have a set of ethics. But here things are teda-meda. People say something, do something, mean something else... Nothing is black and white,\u201d she rues. She\u2019s not just got a beautiful voice but also a beautiful face.

It explains that liposuction and liposculpture can be used to help hone patients bodies to the image they want.\n\nBrooklyn, United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \n\nA Long Island liposuction, cosmetic, skin and laser surgery center has launched a new report on the benefits of liposuction and liposculpture as a way to gently reshape the body. Doctor Rokhsar, who runs the surgery, is at the forefront of research and teaching and lectures regularly on cosmetic procedures. His latest report focuses on how the service can be a way to remove unwanted fat stores safely and gently.\n\nMore information can be found at: http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction.\n\nThe site explains that, unlike many practices, the Long Island cosmetic surgery is not a one pony show. It boasts over 40 lasers and energy based devices in its world class centers in both Manhattan and Long Island.\n\nWhile some centers will seek to sell their services, patients at the New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center will never get a sales pitch. The center will give them a realistic expectation about the outcome of procedures they are contemplating, and from there they can make the best decision for themselves.\n\nDr Rokhsar is certified in dermatology and has completed additional training in cosmetic surgery fellowship. He explains that anyone considering liposuction in the New York area should be sure to ask their doctor if they are board certified in dermatology or plastic surgery. This is because a medical degree doesn\u2019t qualify doctors to practice in the field of lasers and cosmetic surgery.\n\nThe new report explains that liposculpture and liposuction remove excess fat from the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, waistline, arms, knees, ankles, calves, cheeks, jowls and neck. Liposculpture offers more precise sculpting through using smaller instruments for the process.\n\nThis works because it relies on tumescent fluid to numb the fat as well as to help liquefy it, allowing the doctor to remove it through small cannulas. It allows for fine sculpting of the body so local patients can better get the shape they desire.\n\nFull details of the Long Island liposuction services available at New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center can be found by visiting the URL above.\n\nContact Info:\n\nName: Chris Hayes\n\nOrganization: Virtual Heroics\n\nAddress: 2440 East 29th Street, Brooklyn, 11235 United States\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.virtualheroics.com\n\nSource: PressCable\n\nRelease ID: 1652","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"New York metro area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Long Island Liposculpture New York Cosmetic Surgery Melt Fat Report Launched","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Diego","zipCode":"92111","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Diego","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KFMB-TV","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"169671793","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"KFMB-TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cbs8.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction","http://www.virtualheroics.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202817645","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A shining example of that is the Etisalat Award for Arabic Children's Literature, organised annually by the UAE Board on Books for Young People (UAEBBY) and sponsored by the Emirates Telecommunications Corporation (Etisalat Group). \n\nLaunched in 2009 by Sheikha Bodour bint Sultan Al Qasimi, Founder and Patron of the UAEBBY, it has been instrumental in supporting publishers, authors and illustrators of Arabic children's and young adults' books around the world. \n\nThe Award aims to recognise and reward the best talents in the children's books and encourage the publication and distribution of Arabic books for younger readers with quality texts, designs and production. Its aims are in line with the vision of H.H. Dr. Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, to promote reading as a noble habit and instil a love of Arabic books in children and young adults. \n\nThe Etisalat Award for Arabic Children's Literature is specifically designed for children's books aimed at age groups between 0-18 years old. The competition is open to all Arabic and international publishing houses as long as the entry is written in Arabic, is original - and not translated - and is of an excellent literary and artistic standard. Each publishing house has the right to submit a maximum of three entries in the Children's Category and an unlimited number of entries in the Young Adult Category. \n\nThe submitted entries should not have been published more than three years previously for the Children's Category and not more than five years previously for the Young Adult Category. They should also not have previously received any local, Arab or international awards. The eighth edition of the event has seen the highest number of participants and some of the highest quality of submissions since its inception in 2009. There have been 151 entries from 53 Arab publishing houses in 13 Arab Countries, including 87 entries in the ?Children's Book of the Year' category and 64 entries in the ?Young Adults' Book of the Year' category. \n\nThe Ruler of Sharjah honoured the winners of the Etisalat Award for Arabic Children's Literature at the opening ceremony of the 35th edition of Sharjah International Book Fair (SIBF). ?Ehem..Ehem Marrerni Men Fadlek' (Ahem..Ahem Let me Pass Please) written by Nabiha Mheidly, illustrated by Walid Taher and published by Al Hadaek Group, Lebanon, won the ?Children's Book of the Year', while ?Sorakh Khalf Al Abwab' (Scream behind the Doors), written by Rania Hussein Amin and published by Nahdet Misr Publishing Group, Egypt, won the ?Young Adults' Book of the Year'. \n\nThe Winner of the ?Best Text' was ?Oredo an akoon Solhafat' (I Want to Be a Turtle), written by Amal Farah, illustrated by Osama Abu Al Ola and published by Shagara Publishing House, Egypt, while ?Bolqosh' (Bolqosh) written and illustrated by Yara Bamieh and published by The Palestine Writing Workshop, Dalia Association, Palestine won ?Best Production'. Finally, the ?Best Illustration' went to ?Berkat Al Asela Al Zarqa'a' (The Pool of Blue Questions) written by Maya Abu Alhayat, illustrated by Hassan Manasrah and published by The Palestine Writing Workshop, Dalia Association, Palestine. \n\nIn recognition of its magnificent contribution to promoting a love of literature in young people through its sponsorship of the Etisalat Award, Etisalat Group was bestowed a 'UAE Pioneers Award' as the 'Best Private Sector Initiative to Encourage Reading among Children. Saleh Al Abdooli, CEO of Etisalat Group, received the award from His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minster of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, at the ceremony that took place in November last year. The event saw a total of 45 organisations - one representing each year of the UAE's formation - honoured for having made a considerable impact in elevating reading during the UAE's ?Year of Reading.' On the side-lines of the 35th edition of the Sharjah International Book Fair (SIBF) and as part of ?Warsha' programme, the innovative program by the Etisalat Award for Arabic Children's Literature, the UAEBBY organised a workshop for a group of authors at Al Noor Island in Sharjah. In April 2016, the ?Warsha' programme sponsored a number of Arab illustrators to participate in the 53rd edition of the Bologna Children's Book Fair (BCBF) in Italy where they attended the ?Illustrators Caf?'. It also sponsored a number of Emirati and Arab publishers to participate in the 31st edition of the International Publishers Association (IPA), which took place in London. \n\nShare this article: \n\nFeatured Story \n\nAfghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. \n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. \n\n'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said.

The judge ruled in favor of an ACLU habeas corpus petition) on behalf of two Iraqi men who had been detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday.\n\nPresident Trump on Friday banned the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries \u2013 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for at least the next 90 days. Those countries were defined in an Obama Administration 2016 law on immigration visas as \u201ccountries of concern.\u201d The executive order also bars Syrian refugees indefinitely from entering the US and stops the admission of all refugees to the US for four months. It also calls for a review of the Visa Interview Waiver Program allowing travelers from 38 countries to renew their visas without an interview.\n\nIt should be noted that the Trump order is based on the Obama Administration\u2019s Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act (H.R. 158), which prohibits citizens of countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program from visiting the United States under the program if they are dual nationals of or have recently traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria. It was signed into law on December 18, 2015, as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of FY2016.\n\nJudge Donnelly, a 2015 President Obama nominee, ruled that \u201cthere is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject\u201d to President Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nsaid Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, told The Hill that the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators chanting \u201cNo ban, no wall, sanctuary for all!\u201d and \u201cNo hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here!\u201d gathered outside a JFK Airport Arrivals terminal. While this was going on, according to Reuters, government officials and security employees were struggling to figure out which Muslim travelers could enter the US legally and who could not.\n\nU.S. Representatives from NYC Jerrold Nadler (whose district included the Twin Towers) and Nydia Velazquez drove to JFK airport to demand the release of refugees being held under the president\u2019s executive order. After meeting with officials from the Custom and Border Patrol agency, one of the refugees, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an Iraqi translator who helped the United States government, was released. Nadler and Velazquez were working to release 11 others being held at JFK under the new executive order.\n\nReps. Nadler and Velazquez issued the a joint statement saying: \u201cToday, we saw in real human terms the damage and the absurdity of Trump\u2019s policies. The president\u2019s executive order is mean-spirited, ill-conceived, and ill-advised. The order almost banned a man from entering the country who has worked for the United States government for 10 years, who risked his life to help us and to help our troops, and who loves our country. [\u2026] This should not happen in America.\u201d\n\nMembers of the New York City Council Jewish Caucus also drove to JFK, where they issued their own joint statement, saying: As members of the City Council\u2019s Jewish Caucus we are deeply concerned about the current state of affairs at JFK airport and international transportation hubs across the country. President Trump\u2019s heartless refugee ban is antithetical to the interests and values of our nation and our city. [\u2026]The fact that refugees are currently being detained in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty is almost too painful to bear.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Hill, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Trump\u2019s order would apply to green card holders from the seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\nRepublican Sen.

The new service is a low moisture method of cleaning carpets that leaves them clean and quick drying.\n\nJoplin, United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \n\nCrystal Clean Carpets, based in Joplin, have launched a new low moisture carpet cleaning service. This new service does not soak the carpets leaving them dry within the hour saving customers valuable time.\n\nFor more information please visit: http://carpetcleaningjoplin.net.\n\nCrystal Clean Carpets is owner operated and the owner, Alan Snider, will personally answer phone calls to ensure customer satisfaction. The website explains that they are the premier low moisture and upholstery cleaners for Joplin, Carthage, and the surrounding area in South West Missouri.\n\nModern carpets can hold up to a pound of dirt per square foot and this dirt consists of dust, allergens, pollen and other impurities. The site states that not only does cleaning carpets restore them to looking their best, it also helps to keep the home healthy and hygienic.\n\nCrystal Clean Carpets help homeowners to achieve carpet cleanliness by using a low moisture cleaning system rather than the traditional hot water extraction method. The hot water extraction method involves thoroughly soaking the carpet leaving it wet for hours, as well as trailing hoses through the home. With this method stains and spots often re-appear.\n\nThe low moisture method `uses patented technology to aggressively agitate the carpet without damaging the fibers meaning that less water is needed leaving carpets dry within an hour. Another benefit of using less water is that carpets are not soaked through and that means that stains do not wick back and re-appear. They use a machine that is self contained and does not trail hoses through customers houses bringing disruption to a minimum.\n\nCrystal Clean Carpets do not use soap and modern low moisture cleaning chemicals are 96% biodegradable, making it an earth friendly option. They also leave carpets with no sticky residue and are safe for children and pets.\n\nThe company also offers services that include upholstery and pet odor.

I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly why I stopped. I just didn\u2019t feel like doing it anymore. One week passed, then two, and before I knew it, months were going by and I felt no inclination to restart. The soft blond hairs found from the ankles up never bothered me. \n \nAt first I thought nothing of it, but over time, insecurities about my leg hair began to develop. I received unsolicited comments from guys. \u201cHannah, you\u2019d be so pretty if your legs weren\u2019t hairier than half of the guys on my lacrosse team,\u201d  is just one cruel, judgemental comment I received from someone I once considered my friend. \n \nWhen I rejected the normal idea of femininity by not shaving my legs, it changed people\u2019s perception of my looks \u2014 to some, I became less beautiful. \n \nGirls commented too; I came to recognize the pinched smile and raised eyebrows: the face of a girl who is taking great pleasure in judging someone else. \u201cSo Hannah, still not shaving your legs?\u201d It made me feel as if my choice made me ugly and weird. Once again, my definition of feminine was being seen as inferior. \n \n\n \nI tried to brush off all of these encounters but they lodged themselves deep in my subconscious. I knew that I was happy with my self expression. Why then, when I met my boyfriend a year and half ago, did I feel flustered and embarrassed when I explained my natural legs? Fortunately, he was kind and supportive, which has continued throughout our relationship. \n \nFast forward to December 2016. After some consideration, I decided to wax my legs before a trip to Hawaii. I did it mostly to simplify sunscreen application, something my pale self needs to do 2 or 3 times a day in sunny weather. \n \nAt the waxing salon, I told the aesthetician how long it had been since I last shaved. She thought I was kidding, and when I assured her that I wasn\u2019t, her response was \u201cOh. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to shave?\u201d and \u201cWow, I\u2019ve never heard of that before.\u201d For the rest of my appointment she was patronizing and even rude. She, like many others, couldn\u2019t comprehend the fact that her idea of femininity was different from my own, and it translated directly into her treatment of me. \n \nHer reaction has been on my mind ever since. How are women supposed to be strong and independent if we don\u2019t even support each other? \n \nFor years, I have consciously made the decision to leave my legs natural and the response I have received has damaged my self confidence. When I finally waxed, the worst and most surprising thing was that I loved it. After years of not succumbing to unkind remarks and social norms, I had lost. My hairless legs made me feel \u2018pretty\u2019 and \u2018girly\u2019 and I hated it. \n \n\n \nIn a strange twist of fate, it took finally removing my leg hair to harden my resolve to choose my own path. I\u2019ve realized that I can\u2019t control what people think, but I can control how I react to it. This is my body and no one can tell me what will make it more or less beautiful. Maybe I will shave my legs again one day; maybe I won\u2019t. Above all, I want to be my own version of feminine; I want to be unashamed to be me. \n \nIn our society, the definition of feminine is incredibly narrow. We are constantly bombarded with images of what a woman should look like and we are frequently sexualized in all forms of media. We are shown beauty standards that are completely subjective and nearly impossible for an average woman to achieve. Worse than this, we shame each other for not living up to \u2018perfect\u2019.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Hannah Jensen"},"topics":[],"title":"My Version of Feminine","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V5A","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Burnaby","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Simon Fraser University The Peak","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169804123","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"39"},"name":"Simon Fraser University The Peak","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.the-peak.ca"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202820819","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.the-peak.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womenspitsweb-300x200.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.the-peak.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womenspubesweb-300x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The app is more than a passport renewal app and includes other features such as passport photos, visa requirements, an emergency info button (for travelers who lose their passport or visa while in another country), and a passport renewal reminder feature that will remind users via email to renew their passport nine months before their passport expires.\u201d\n\nThe free for download ItsEasy Passport Renewal App is safe, secure, confidential, user friendly, and is based upon the company\u2019s exceptional 40-year reputation. The two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport, and their ability to take passport photos which are then reviewed and approved by qualified ItsEasy passport professionals. Travelers in need of only photos have the option to have their passport photos printed by ItsEasy and delivered by first class or overnight mail, or have them emailed electronically to be printed by the user.\n\nWhen using the app, prior to the applicant\u2019s passport renewal order being completed, and in addition to the Department of State\u2019s passport fee, ItsEasy charges an honest fee of $29.95 for their services. Considering the value, the price is well worth the investment. The passport photo feature alone saves $10-$15 as well as the savings in time, travel and wait at the post office or drugstore for passport photos. Additionally, the app features trackable priority United States Postal Service shipping label a cost savings of approximately $6.45 and 24/7 customer support plus the peace of mind of knowing you used the correct forms and order status updates. Users are provided with the choice of two renewal processing time frames \u2013 standard approximately (6 to 8 week) and expedited (2 to 3 weeks.)\n\nOnce the order is completed through the app, ItsEasy will instantly email the customer the correct passport application to be printed and completed, a simple checklist and a secure trackable USPS priority shipping label to send the documents into ItsEasy for reviewing and processing. The professionals at ItsEasy will then deliver all necessary documents to the U.S. Department of State, who issues all passports and passport cards.\n\nAlwadish added, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want an app that saves you precious time and money? Between buying the envelope, postage, passport photos and running around for the errand, if the value of the users\u2019 time saved is factored in then the savings would grow exponentially! We are providing you with peace of mind with government approved and regulated experts handling the entire process\u2014including pre-checking of documents, printing the photos, writing the check and gathering what you\u2019d have to go buy yourself \u2013 you\u2019re in safe hands and we can advise you every step of the way. I can confidently say that you\u2019ll be aware of where your application is at all times.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the 10-year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative approaching, creating the passport renewal surge, the U.S. Department of State also recently announced the elimination of visa page inserts for U.S. passports beginning this year. Previously, U.S. passport holders had the option to pay for the insertion of additional 24-page visa inserts when valid passports lacked adequate space for entry or exit visa stamps. However, now applicants in need of additional pages in their passports will have to obtain a renewal \u2013 making this app even more relevant for U.S. travelers.\n\nFor more information on ItsEasy, the new app and other services, visit the website at https://www.itseasy.com/ or call 1-866-ITS-EASY.

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Miami-Dade","zipCode":"33172","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Miami","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Miami Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657045","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"833"},"name":"Miami Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.miamiherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202828318","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?
