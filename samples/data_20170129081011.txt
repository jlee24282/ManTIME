Roosevelt called education the \"safeguard of democracy.\" But who provides safeguards to ensure students are getting the best education possible and taxpayers are getting their money's worth?  \n Download PDF   \nA massive education system is constantly being refined, melted down and reinvented by state and federal government.  \n \nThe moving targets \u2014 state and federal benchmarks \u2014 make measuring school success tricky, and each state does it differently. \n \nGeorgia uses its College and Career Ready Performance Index to try to convey a full picture of a school\u2019s performance. Florida focuses more heavily on student test scores. \n \nSchool officials say it\u2019s important to consider multiple factors that affect school performance, including poverty, home dynamics, teacher turnover and ever-changing state requirements. \n +10    \nDerrek Vaughn | The Valdosta Daily TimesState School Superintendent Richard Woods said while CCRPI scores show the work that needs to be done, it doesn\u2019t reflect all the great things happening in schools across the state. \n  \nSchool districts in the SunLight Project coverage area \u2014 Valdosta, Thomasville, Moultrie, Dalton, Tifton and Milledgeville, Ga., along with Live Oak, Jasper and Mayo, Fla., the surrounding counties and school systems across Georgia and North Florida \u2014 are constantly pushing to improve performance, especially since state assessments greatly impact a school\u2019s reputation. \n \nCCRPI: What It Is and Why It Matters \n \nThe CCRPI is Georgia\u2019s accountability system for public schools. The Georgia Department of Education describes it as a \u201croadmap to improvement\u201d that shows if schools are helping students achieve success.  \n \nIt gives a whole picture of a school\u2019s performance, said Matt Cardoza, chief communications officer for the Georgia DOE. \n \n\u201c(The score) matters because you want to know ultimately how your school is educating your child, if they\u2019re doing that effectively,\u201d Cardoza said. \n \nCCRPI scores are calculated on a 100-point scale once a year for individual schools and entire school districts. \n \nIt answers many questions, the Georgia DOE says: \u201cAre students achieving at college- and career-ready levels? Are students making academic progress? Are students prepared for what comes next?\u201d \n \nThe score may be a single number but it is determined by an intricate web of categories and sub-categories. The numerous measurements take into account things such as test scores, student growth, graduation rates and special teaching strategies. \n \nThe score comes in four parts: Achievement, Progress, Achievement Gap and Challenge Points. \n \nAchievement determines if students are performing at the right level. \n \nProgress compares a student\u2019s academic growth with others across the state. \n \nAchievement Gap measures the difference between the lowest-performing students and the state average. \n \nChallenge Points offers schools the chance to earn bonus points for \u201cexceeding the bar\u201d or for helping specific student groups meet established goals. \n \nThe statewide composite score for 2016 is 73.6, down from 75.5 in 2015. The drop came mostly from elementary schools. The Georgia DOE said the decline was caused by failure to meet goals for students who are poor or disabled, or who do not speak English fluently. \n \nBecause of the complexity of the scoring system, Cardoza said it\u2019s important to not only look at the final number, but to also dig deeper to see what factors contributed to the score. \n \nEach school faces unique challenges, and a low number doesn\u2019t always equal bad teaching, he added. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019d be really difficult for me to say as a blanket statement (the score) means X because it\u2019s not the same for any school,\u201d Cardoza said. \u201cThere\u2019s no school that\u2019s exactly alike. That\u2019s where school districts especially have to really dig in and find out what (the score) means. \n \n\u201cIt can mean quality of teaching. It could mean something completely different. It could mean outside circumstances, more kids in poverty, and therefore more is required to help those students. There could be so many different things.\u201d \n \nSchools take the score seriously because it impacts public perception as well as goals for the school, Cardoza said. \n \nA Moving Target \n \nThe CCRPI has been in Georgia since 2012. But the way the scores are calculated has changed every year since then except for the past two years. \n \nThe constant shifts in the scoring system have created a moving target that is difficult to figure out, many school officials said. \n \nIn South Georgia, teachers are burdened with unintended stress and fatigue as they try to adapt to a scoring method that is never the same for long, said Scarlet Brown, assistant superintendent of teaching and learning at Valdosta City Schools. Similar sentiments were expressed throughout the state and things are not much different in Florida.  \n \nThe frequent changes can also make it hard for schools to measure yearly progress and to get an accurate picture of their current condition. Even if a school stayed exactly the same from year to year, its scores would rise and fall in that same time because of tweaks the state made to the complex CCRPI. \n  \n[embedded content]  \n  \nThe score for Tift County Schools remained relatively steady from 2015 to 2016, dropping slightly from 73.7 in to 73.4. \n \nTift School Superintendent Patrick Atwater said he\u2019s already expecting scores to drop lower next year \u2014 not because the school is declining, but because the scoring standards are shifting again. \n \n\u201cWe expect next year for our elementary schools and middle schools to drop in scores because of the move away from testing science and social studies,\u201d Atwater said. \u201cSome of our stronger schools did exceptionally well in science and social studies last year and it really helped them on their achievement scores. They\u2019re not going to get any credit for that next year.\u201d \n \nAtwater described the CCRPI as a \u201cfrustrating, data-driven giant\u201d that is often difficult to understand. \n \n\u201cCCRPI does gather a lot of good data, it\u2019s just that the data gathered is so comprehensive and it\u2019s so complicated in the way that they calculate it that it\u2019s very difficult to use it,\u201d Atwater said. \u201cIn my 26 years in public education, I\u2019ve never seen anything as complicated as CCRPI.\u201d \n \nThe system is so complicated the school district had to hire a consultant to keep up with the constant changes. \n \nThat consultant, Bobby Smith, said he expects the CCRPI to keep changing as new legislation and policies trickle down from the state and federal level. \n \nCardoza admits that the CCRPI is not perfect. \n \n\u201cWe know that it needs more than just test scores, but at the same time it is a very complex system. (It\u2019s) sometimes hard for parents and even school district educators to really understand it, so we\u2019re trying to simplify it some,\u201d Cardoza said. \n \n\u201cCCRPI certainly has its flaws. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect but it\u2019s the metric we have now that at least can help you take a look at certain areas of your school and also use it to see how schools in your area (are) performing.\u201d \n +10    \nDusty Kornegay, Thomas County Schools Superintendent \n Picasa  \nDr. Dusty Kornegay, Thomas County Schools superintendent, is no fan of the CCRPI, partially because of the constant adjustments in the scoring formula. He also said online testing undermines the index\u2019s credibility. \n \n\u201cMilestones\u201d is the name of the test used to determine the academic measures of the CCRPI. The Georgia DOE has been pushing districts to give these tests online to reduce costs and expedite scoring. \n \nThomas County scored 70 in 2016 as compared to 76 in 2015. Kornegay blames online testing for the drop, saying younger students perform poorly on the test if they aren\u2019t familiar with the device used to give the test. \n \n\"A careful internal analysis confirmed by a third party has found that almost all of the decline in our Milestones scores can be attributed to factors associated with online testing. The negative effects of online testing were most pronounced in elementary grades in students with disabilities and in math,\u201d Kornegay said. \n \nThe Poverty Factor \n \nThe poverty level of a district also plays a big role in CCRPI scores, said Valdosta's Scarlet Brown. \n \nValdosta schools scored a 65.9 in 2016, down from 71.4 in 2015. The district\u2019s lowest-performing school was Newbern Middle School, which scored 56.3. \n \nMost of Newbern\u2019s students live in housing projects and come from at-risk environments, factors that make a big difference in scores, Brown said. \n \n\u201cIf you look at the differences in scores that you\u2019re going to see statewide, it unfortunately ends up sometimes being a reflection of the poverty levels of the district. I think you have to take that into account,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t learn. They can learn but the challenges are very different than a home where you may have two parents that are working in the home. They\u2019re able to help with homework and provide extracurricular activities, versus a parent that may be holding down two or three jobs and may be a single parent in the home, male or female. \n \n\u201cWe can\u2019t deny the (different) dynamics. The school has a responsibility to do much more for that child. So we have significant challenges there. We\u2019re very aware. We\u2019re very concerned. We have a lot of work to do.\u201d \n \nCharter School Challenges \n \nCharter schools are public-funded schools of choice, meaning they give parents and students another choice for education apart from the regular school districts. \n \nCharter schools were scattered throughout the 2016 CCRPI scores. Many charters got some of the highest scores in the state. Others scraped the bottom of the barrel, earning 30s and 40s. \n +10    \nSubmitted photoJoanna Richardson with her kindergarten class at Scintilla Charter Academy. The school, which opened in 2015, scored 53.2 on the 2016 CCRPI, a number the school leaders are working hard to improve. \n  \nScintilla Charter Academy, one of the newer charter schools in the state, scored 53.2; the school is not happy with the number, said Mandy Avera, Scintilla dean of students and school support. \n \n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not pleased. But a first-year charter has unique experiences in trying to serve scholars from all different sorts of backgrounds.\u201d \n \nScintilla opened in August 2015 and experienced a leadership change after only one semester. \n \nAvera said the change and the newness of the school made a big impact on the score. She said charters have to build programs from scratch, programs that come cookie cutter in most public schools, programs the school didn\u2019t have in its first year. \n \nThe score was also calculated from only 140 of the school\u2019s 400 students, so it doesn\u2019t represent Scintilla as a whole, Avera said. \n \nAvera and her staff weren\u2019t surprised by the score and they\u2019ve already been working for months to improve the school by implementing a comprehensive academic program. \n \n\u201c(The score) is not indicative of where we feel like we are now, but we definitely are hard at work improving our scores,\u201d Avera said. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re building something different and we don\u2019t like our children to be judged just on a test score but we want something that students deserve. That just doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d \n \nWith new charter schools, Cardoza from the Georgia DOE said student performance is determined more by the schools where the children came from than by the charter itself. \n \nThe Failing Schools Problem \n \nThe Georgia DOE doesn\u2019t label schools as failing, Cardoza said. But it doesn\u2019t have to because Georgia\u2019s government already did. \n \nIn 2016, Gov. Nathan Deal said schools scoring below 60 for at least three consecutive years should be considered failing and taken over by the state for the purpose of rehabilitation. \n \nHe put his idea into writing as Amendment 1 on the 2016 election ballot. School districts all across the state vehemently opposed it, saying it would wrongly take school control away from local leaders. \n \nThe amendment failed, but the problem of failing schools remains, state officials have said. How the problem will be fixed is unknown, but the CCRPI scores will most likely play a large role in determining which schools need to be fixed. \n \nThe scores for the entire Baldwin County School District went up in 2016. Each of the six public schools in the district saw some amount of improvement ranging from 0.3 points to as many as 13.4. \n \n\u201cThe increases we have seen this year with the CCRPI report and our nearly 20 percent increase in the graduation rate have come from the incredible work of our teachers, students, administrators and parents,\u201d Baldwin County Superintendent Dr. Noris Price said. \n \nBlandy Hills Elementary\u2019s remarkable increase from 49.4 in 2015 to 62.8 this year moved the school from the second-lowest performer in the district to third highest. Baldwin High School had the highest score locally at a 77.8, and outperformed the state's 75.7 average for high schools. \n \nDespite the improvement, Baldwin County still has three schools deemed as failing by the state's measure: Eagle Ridge Elementary (54.1), Midway Elementary (56.6), and Oak Hill Middle (59.1). \n \nPrice said this year's increases are just the start. \n \n\"We have been implementing innovative programs and changing the organizational culture of our schools. We are building a world-class educational system here in Baldwin County based on the fundamental principle that every child is capable of learning and we're seeing that begin to pay off,\u201d Price said. \n \nDifferent State, Same Challenges \n \nFlorida has a different scoring system for its public schools, but it measures many of the same things, such as test scores and student progress. The state assigns a letter grade to each school and district. \n +10    \nSuperintendent Ted Roush, Suwannee County Schools \n  \nTed Roush, superintendent of Suwannee County Schools, said Florida\u2019s education standards have changed just as often as Georgia\u2019s. \n \n\u201cThe frustration with school grades is that the state has changed almost on an annual basis the way in which those grades are administered to schools and what factors count in those components that eventually ends up as a school grade,\u201d Roush said. \n \nSuwannee County Schools earned a C in 2016. \n +10    \nSuperintendent Rex Mitchell, Hamilton County Schools \n  \nHamilton County Schools earned a D. Superintendent Rex Mitchell said the district has struggled to meet state standards ever since the inception of state testing. \n \n\u201cSome of the obstacles we face is when you live in a small, rural, low socioeconomic area, many families do not have the resources to supplement what the schools do,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cOver the years, we have been doing what I call chasing the test scores.\u201d \n \nMitchell said while he is dedicated to improving the grade, he is more concerned about preparing students for the next stage in life. \n \n\u201cI am trying to change the focus of the district from \u2018What good test scores can we have?\u2019 to \u2018Can we make sure all of our students when they leave us are prepared for their future?\u2019\u201d Mitchell said. \n \n\u201cThe tests are not going to become what drives us. The tests are going to become a part of the process that we go through. \n \n\u201cWe know that school grades are very important, and we are obviously focused on having as high a school grade as possible. But our primary focus is going to be to ensure our students are in a position to be successful in the next part of their lives,\" Mitchell continued. \n \n\u201cWe feel like if we do a good job with that, that our test scores and our school grades will show the improvement.\u201d \n \nLafayette County Schools earned a B in 2016. Superintendent Robby Edwards said it would be even higher if it weren\u2019t for the new \u201clearning gains\u201d component the state added recently. \n \nLearning gains measure if a student performs better or worse from year to year. Edwards said the new factor brought scores down across the state. \n \nEdwards also believes schools shouldn\u2019t be too invested in the state grades. But he did say they are a good indicator of how well a school is doing and how that school compares to the rest of the state. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get too wrapped up around the numbers because it is not really about numbers or grades, but it is a way for us to look and be able to see how well we are doing for our students,\u201d Edwards said. \n \nMaking it Work, Despite the Difficulties \n \nThomasville City Schools received scores of 60 or above for all of its schools except for one. \n +10    \nSubmitted photoHarper Elementary School was the lowest-performing school in the Thomasville City Schools district for 2016, scoring 49.5. \n  \nHarper Elementary\u2019s 49.5 was the second year of a downward trend \u2014 decreasing from a 53.9 in 2015 and decreasing further from the 70.7 score in 2014. \n +10    \nMelvin Hugans, Harper Elementary School Principal \n  \nTaking Harper\u2019s reins in August \u2014 the third change in administration in three years \u2014 Principal Melvin Hugans said a score improvement plan was implemented his first month. \n \n\u201cOur goal is to focus on the area of literacy, which was an identified need from prior Georgia Milestone assessments,\u201d Hugans said. \n \nThe literacy-centered plan includes close reading strategies and a heightened writing focus. Analyzing formative data is key, Hugans added. He said the data pinpoints student retention. \n \n\u201cOur initial results have shown our students are retaining a lot more information that teachers are covering in their classrooms,\u201d Hugans said. \n \nDespite the downward trend, Hugans said math is the strongest area of Harper\u2019s score. With an improvement plan in place, Hugans equated accomplishing the plan to a team play-off scenario. \n \n\u201cHarper has the opportunity to show that this year, they can change the paradigm,\u201d Hugans said. \u201cThat is our goal. We\u2019ve had two years of scores that were below what the Georgia Department of Education expects, and those scores are not close to where the governor is asking all schools to be. Our goal is to this year, turn the trend. We need to show growth.\" \n \nThomasville is not alone in its pinpoint focus on literacy. \n +10    \nMarni Kirkland, director of curriculum, Colquitt County Schools \n  \nMarni Kirkland, director of curriculum for Colquitt County Schools, said reading is the key that opens progress in all subject areas. \n \nColquitt scored 68.2 in 2016, a drop from the previous year's 71.7. \n \n\"I think the biggest issue the district faces is in literacy,\" Kirkland said. \"All teachers have learned strategies to help students read better.\" \n \nThe school system has focused on reading by using \"interventions\" that could be either tutored by system teachers or an outside instructor or with an online program. When students who have fallen behind catch up through the intervention, they move back to their regular schedule. \n \nValdosta has had a \u201claser-like\u201d focus on literacy for years, Scarlet Brown said. Additionally, the district focuses on building support networks among teachers and solid relationships between teachers and students. \n \nDalton Public Schools Superintendent Jim Hawkins said he's confident the system's students are learning but he wants to ensure that is reflected in the CCRPI scores. \n \nDalton\u2019s score climbed slightly from 66.1 in 2015 to 66.2 in 2016. \n \nHawkins said one of the keys to maintaining and improving the score is to focus on the Georgia Milestones tests, which are a key part of the CCRPI. \n \n\"At the district level, the thing that we have not done before is that we have tried to give teachers and students opportunities to practice on the test. The old test, the CRCT (Criterion-Referenced Competency Test) was generally multiple choice,\u201d Hawkins said. \n \n\u201cNow, they have an extended response and a constructive response, which you have to write out. And a lot of it in our last administration was online. Our students were walking into this test and they'd never seen the extended response and a constructive response.\u201d \n \nThis year, using Education Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (ESPLOST) funds, the Dalton district provided each student in third grade through high school a personal electronic device they can use in school and take home. \n \nHawkins said by using the device students can take practice tests online, getting comfortable with the process. \n \n\"And because they have their own device, when they do take the test, they are not going into a lab and taking the test on a computer they have never used before,\" he said. \"They are taking the test on their own device which they have been using for some time.\" \n \nLowndes County Schools fared much better than other schools in the SunLight Project coverage area, scoring 82.2. \n \nThe district is proud of the student and teacher progress, said Rodney Green, assistant superintendent of teaching and learning. But he added district leaders are pushing to get the score higher there as well, and their strategy is a simple one. \n \n\u201cWe provide teachers the support and resources they need to be successful. Our teachers, in return, set high expectations for student learning throughout the academic year,\u201d Green said. \n +10    \nSuperintendent Robby Edwards, Lafayette County Schools \n  \nLafayette County has the third highest graduation rate in the state with 93 percent. Robby Edwards said dual enrollment and tech courses play a big part in keeping that grad rate high. \n \n\u201cThis seems to keep the hook in the kids to keep them motivated and moving forward with not only their career field but also their high school credits that they need to get their diploma,\u201d Edwards said. \n \nSuwannee County\u2019s Ted Roush said focusing on early grades is the key to strengthening his district. \n \n\u201cIn order for our system to get where we want to go academically, we have to be sure we get our K-3rd grade foundational skills as solid as can be,\u201d Roush said. \n \nNot Just a Number \n \nState School Superintendent Richard Woods said while CCRPI scores show the work that needs to be done, it doesn\u2019t reflect all the great things happening in schools across the state. \n +10    \nScarlet Brown, assistant superintendent of teaching and learning, Valdosta City Schools \n  \nScarlet Brown agrees. She once heard a speech by Phil Lanoue, the 2015 National Superintendent of the Year. One thing he said has always stuck with her: \u201cNo one would want to be just a number.\u201d \n \nBrown applied the sentiment to the numbers schools receive. \n \n\u201cYou would never want someone to say \u2018you\u2019re an 82\u2019 and that represents everything about you as an individual because really it\u2019s hard to say that that one number is representative of everything that school is doing,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOf all the individuals, of all the children. It\u2019s a very simplistic way of looking at a complex system. \n \n\"We have to be really careful that we don\u2019t use that number to demoralize staff and students and parents. It doesn\u2019t mean that we dismiss it. We don\u2019t dismiss it. But it\u2019s one piece of information in the bigger puzzle.\" \n \nThe SunLight Project team of journalists who contributed to this report includes Charles Oliver, Billy Hobbs, Eve Guevara, Alan Mauldin and Patti Dozier, along with the writer, team leader John Stephen.

His Highness Sheikh Sabah is a distinguished ruler who received both executive and legislative backing along with the support of the people at the start of his reign and continues to do so. \n \nBorn on June 16, 1929, the fourth son of Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was handpicked as a potentially astute statesman. After studying at the local Mubarakiya School, his father sent him to the West to pick up on diplomatic skills he would soon be able to master. \n \nUpon his return in 1954, Sheikh Sabah was immediately handed the role of forming one of the sides of a committee tasked with restructuring state bodies despite being only 25 years old. A year later, he was appointed head of the state social affairs and labor unit, a position he would later thrive in. \n \nAt a time of heavy regional and international labor migration into Kuwait, he was responsible for regulating the relationship between employee and business owner. He was also behind the formation of specialist training centers, sports clubs, welfare centers for women, children, the elderly and special needs cases and a traditional arts center. \n \nIn 1957, after being tasked with overseeing the state publishing department, the first edition of cultural magazine Al-Arabi was published. \n \nCulture \nIt was to later become a huge hit amongst Arab readers and helped put Kuwait on the map as a serious advocate of culture and knowledge. A publications\u2019 and media law, that placed Kuwait as the top Arab country in the World Media Index was another of his contributions. Two years after Kuwait\u2019s independence in 1961, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs \u2014 a position he would continue to fill over a 40-year period. His reign as foreign minister was marked by numerous shifts and turbulent circumstances. But thanks to his wise judgement the then minister Sheikh Sabah was able to steady the ship. After raising Kuwait\u2019s flag for the first time at the United Nations in 1963, he immediately set out to cover his role with fervor, becoming instrumental in his policy as a regional. His first task was to bring together the conflicting sides in Yemen\u2019s civil war, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt who were backing separate sides in the struggle. All the parties were involved in reconciliation talks hosted by Kuwait. \n \nAs the fighting continued between the north and the south of Yemen, he later paid a visit to both resulting in the signature of a peace agreement in 1972. In 1980 he also mediated reconciliation between Yemen and its western neighbors Oman. He was also faced with difficult regional conditions which he managed to sail through smoothly like the eight-year-old Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and Iraq\u2019s occupation of Kuwait in 1990. The role of forming a government, in the place of Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah, was given to him in 2001 after which he was appointed prime minister two years later. \n \nThis is when his focus on economic affairs began. He launched a local fund for SMEs in order to support the youth. \n \nOn international affairs, he looked eastwards to sign a total 10 agreements, MoUs and giant business projects with China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore in 2004. In January 2006, former Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah passed away. His successor was Sheikh Saad, however his extreme sickness prevented him from becoming ruler. It is then that the Cabinet sat down to agree that Sheikh Sabah would be the new ruler \u2014 a decision that later received the Parliament\u2019s backing as well. His Highness the Amir\u2019s development plans for Kuwait are truly underway. Some projects have been completed while some are in the pipeline, including Jaber Hospital, Mubarak Port, and the giant Jaber Bridge which links the north to Kuwait City, Al-Zour refinery, and the new airport. \n \nIn September 2014, and after Kuwait hosted three international conferences which helped raise billions of dollars in an unprecedented step for humanitarian efforts on the Syrian refugee crisis, His Highness was handed a \u2018Humanitarian Leader\u2019 award by UN chief Ban Ki-moon. Throughout his 11-year reign His Highness the Amir oversaw the handing out of many other relief aid, grants and loans worth tens of millions to nations around the world, particularly to the Palestinians and impoverished countries in Africa and Asia. His love for his people was at its most evident when, moments after terrorists\u2019 bombed Imam Al-Sadiq Mosque leaving behind 26 people dead, he showed up unguarded and unarmed to oversee rescue efforts. It was then he made the famous quote \u201cthose are my children.\u201d \n \nIn 2016, His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah continued to support the Syrian refugees, cohosting the fourth international donors conference for Syria which was held in the British capital London in February. His Highness Sheikh Sabah also took part in humanitarian world summit which was held in Istanbul, Turkey, in May of 2016. Late 2016, His Highness Sheikh Sabah added an another milestone to his credential, receiving King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud on his first visit to Kuwait since becoming Monarch of Saudi Arabia. Kuwait will rejoice on the day that their ruler celebrates eleven years in office. A humanitarian, a champion of the weak, a man of compassion and a patriot \u2014 long live His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. \n \nReign \nMeanwhile, senior officials at Kuwait National Guard (KNG), Information Ministry, and Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) marked Saturday the 11th year of His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\u2019s reign. Speaking to KUNA, the senior official praised His Highness the Amir, who began his reign on Jan 29, 2006, for his ever wise decisions that led to the progress and development of Kuwait. On his part, Deputy Chief of the KNG Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah lauded His Highness the Amir long political career that spanned over five decades. \n \nHis Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah had achieved international recognition for his efforts through the UN honoring of him as a humanitarian leader and Kuwait as an global hub for humanitarian efforts. He also lauded His Highness the Amir\u2019s efforts during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, affirming that Sheikh Sabah was a key figure, along with late Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and late Father Amir Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, in liberating Kuwait in 1991. Sheikh Meshal took the chance to wish His Highness the Amir evermore progress and wellbeing. \n \nOn his part, Information Minister and Minister of State for Youth Affairs Sheikh Salman Al-Humoud Al-Sabah said that history will remember His Highness Sheikh Sabah for his relentless efforts in the regional and global scenes. Kuwaitis must follow His Highness the Amir\u2019s vision for 2035, said the minister stressing that the current occasion must be celebrated through the nation\u2019s determination to further develop Kuwait under the banner held by the Kuwaiti leadership. \n \nAlso reflecting similar sentiments, Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) Sheikh Mubarak Duaij Al-Ibrahim Al-Sabah said that His Highness the Amir played an integral role in bringing Kuwait into the forefront of international efforts for peace and security. Whether it was a local, regional, or international issue, His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah also made it his mission to make Kuwait as a nation that contributed to the welfare of the global community, said KUNA\u2019s Director who wished His Highness more progress in years to come. \n \n\u2013 Arab Times Online \n Share this article","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Kuwait news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Kuwaitis celebrate 11 years of His Highness Amir\u2019s reign \u2013 Sheikh Sabah \u2026 distinguished ruler","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Noozz.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"239388058","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Noozz.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.noozz.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kuwaitis+celebrate+11+years+of+His+Highness+Amir%E2%80%99s+reign+%E2%80%93+Sheikh+Sabah+%E2%80%A6+distinguished+ruler&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnoozz.com%2Fkuwaitis-celebrate-11-years-of-his-highness-amirs-reign-sheikh-sabah-d","http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnoozz.com%2Fkuwaitis-celebrate-11-years-of-his-highness-amirs-reign-sheikh-sabah-distinguished-ruler%2F","http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://noozz.com/kuwaitis-celebrate-11-years-of-his-highness-amirs-reign-sheikh-sabah-distinguished-ruler/&media=","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnoozz.com%2Fkuwaitis-celebrate-11-years-of-his-highness-amirs-reign-sheikh-sabah-distinguished-ruler%2F&title=Kuwaitis+celebrate+11+years+of+His+Highness+Amir%E2%80%99s+reign+%E2%80%93+Sheikh","http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://noozz.com/kuwaitis-celebrate-11-years-of-his-highness-amirs-reign-sheikh-sabah-distinguished-ruler/"],"sequenceId":"695202078448","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country.

(Photo: Jody Link/News Journal Correspon) \n  \nIt's finally here! The Year of the Rooster begins on Saturday. Even though it is traditionally an unfortunate year for people born of the celebrated animal year, I'm excited to be a Rooster! I have a feeling in my Rooster belly that this is going to be a great year. I've been practicing my feng shui, cleaning my home, stocking up on my Rooster element \u2014 soft metals \u2014 and most importantly, being consistently hard working and positive. \n \nJust like the Gregorian calendar folks have some fun and sometimes silly traditions to bring in a great new year, so do those that celebrate the changing of the lunar calendar, or what many people around the world refer to as \"Chinese New Year\" (Even though it spreads well beyond the borders of The People's Republic of China). \n \nEach lunar year begins somewhere between the internationally recognized dates of Jan. 21 and Feb. 20, much like Mardi Gras season is positioned between Twelfth Night and Ash Wednesday each year. \n \nMy mom, Lillie Stack, and my aunt, Laura Oakes recently attended a celebration in preparation for the new year in Honolulu, Hawaii, an area rich in Asian culture. They were greeted by dragons being fed dollar bills to ensure a prosperous year, elaborately painted red signs wishing happiness and wealth, and of course, roosters! \n \nADDITIONAL CONTENT \n   \nPENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL \n \nSkopelos presents Bourbon & Bubbles Feb. 12 \n  \nBut the spirit of celebration and preparation for the new year go beyond a fun parade. Tradition brings family, happiness, wealth, health, food and fun all together to ensure we are prepared for what lies ahead. So put on some red undies (very lucky!) and give this beloved holiday a try. \n  \nThe January Gallery Night featured decorations and activities celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year.  (Photo: Jody Link/News Journal Correspon) \n   \nThe most important thing is, of course, food! Having a large meal with extending family on New Year's Eve, referred to as \"Reunion Dinner,\" is very important to keep the family bond tight and tummies full in the coming year. But no crashing at mom and dad's house that night if you are already married, it is said to bring bad fortune to the parents. \n \nNext, be generous. It's like Christmas, gift and money giving is in full swing the week leading up to the new year. But never give sharp objects, which \"cut ties\" to that person; white or black objects, which are reserved for funerals; mirrors, as they attract unfriendly spirits; or shoes, clocks, handkerchiefs, cut flowers or umbrellas, because the words sound similar to things like \"funeral,\" \"evil\" and \"breakup\" in most Chinese dialects. \n \nAs for money, crisp brand new bills in even numbers, other than the number 4 \u2014 which sounds too close to the word \"death\" \u2014 are given in decorated red paper envelopes to signify wealth and generosity. The most lucky amount to give or receive? $88, which is supposed to be twice as lucky as the number 8. \n \nRELATED CONTENT \n   \nPENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL \n \nBeer Garden: Sweet Leif has French, Chinese influences \n  \nFor cleanliness, it's important to have a fresh, clean home and take the trash out before the new year hits. Any cleaning or de-cluttering done the first two days (some go as far as waiting a week) of the new year might be tossing out any good luck the new year has bestowed. The same goes for washing or cutting hair, just wait a day or two to prevent shedding of any good luck. \n  \nElaborate costumes are seen during the Chinese New Year celebration in Honolulu, Hawaii.  (Photo: Lillie Stack/Special to the News Journal) \n   \nThe week leading up to the new year is also said to be the best time to change jobs or start a new hobby. Just like the saying goes, \"out with the old, in with new.\" This practice can really help us make a decision we might have been on the fence about. \n  \nAlso, spoil the children! Crying during the New Year's celebration can bring sorrow in the following year. And maybe go ahead and spoil your significant other as well, it sure can't hurt. \n \nPraying and paying respects to our ancestors during the celebration is a great way to solidify a spiritual bond in the coming year, just like a New Year's resolution for the soul. \n \nSo if you're if you're looking for something fun and beneficial to do in the following days, try practicing these traditions to set up for a fantastic Year of the Rooster. \u201cXīnnián kuàilè!\u201d (Wishing you happiness for the New Year!) \n \nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/2kcokRu","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Happy (Chinese) New Year!

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

While his dad, Doc Rivers, says he\u2019s open to trading his son, I still find it hard to believe that he would actually do it. But if it happens, his value would most likely take a hit, depending on where he lands. But as long as he\u2019s with the Clippers, he should continue to rack up points and 3-pointers. He was quiet in Saturday\u2019s ugly blowout loss to the Clippers with 10 points and six assists on 3-of-11 shooting, but played 38 minutes and was averaging 19.8 points, 4.4 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his previous five games.\n\nT.J.

He bounced back on Saturday with 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, a block and two 3-pointers on Saturday, and even played garbage time in a blowout loss because the Clippers simply don\u2019t have healthy points guards right now. Over his last five he\u2019s averaging 10 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 38 percent shooting. His shooting took a hit on Saturday when he hit just 3-of-12 shots, but he\u2019s getting enough minutes (27.8 in his last five) to make a fantasy dent, and his shooting should be better than this going forward. \n\nMalcolm Brogdon Bucks 55% - Brogdon lost his job to Dellavedova and had scored six or fewer points in three of his last four games before bouncing back with 11 points and five assists on Saturday, although he hit just 4-of-12 shots. He\u2019s averaging just 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.4 steals and just 0.2 3-pointers in his five games since being moved to the bench. Brogdon has plenty of time to reclaim the job or make a comeback, but as long as Delly\u2019s starting, things aren\u2019t looking great for Brogdon.

And they\u2019ve created the Tee Off Classic to celebrate, offering you an opportunity to win a VIP trip for 3 to play a round of golf with Jerome Bettis! Play now. Shooting Guards\n\nDion Waiters Heat 58% - Waiters was at it again on Saturday with 17 points and seven assists, but hit just 1-of-9 3-pointers, or his line would have been a lot bigger. Waiters is averaging 25.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.4 3-pointers over his last five games, knocking down 52 percent of his shots. He\u2019ll take a bit of a hit once Tyler Johnson is back from his shoulder injury, which should happen any day. He\u2019ll also get stung again by the return of Josh Richardson, but even with those guys lurking, Waiters is hot enough right now to be owned in all leagues. Just know that if you pick him up for the upcoming week, you probably missed the best five-game streak of his season.\n\nSeth Curry Mavericks 49% - Curry looks like a full-time starter the rest of the way for the struggling Mavericks, has scored in double figures in six straight games, and is averaging 15 points, three rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.2 steals and 2.4 3-pointers in 31.4 minutes per game over his last five. If he continues to start the rest of the season, Curry should be owned in a lot more leagues.\n\nIman Shumpert Cavaliers 28% - Shumpert had scored in double figures in six straight games before hitting just 2-of-8 shots for six points and three steals in Friday\u2019s win over the Nets. He was 0-for-5 from downtown in that one, but had hit at least two 3-pointers in each of his previous six games. Forget about Friday\u2019s dud and consider Shumpert a favorite to average around 15 points, 2.0 steals and close to 3.0 3-pointers going forward.\n\nGary Harris Nuggets 63% - Harris came through on Saturday with 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a 3-pointers, but the Suns typically give it up to opposing guards. He\u2019s averaging 11 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.2 3-pointers on 45 percent shooting over his last five games, but he\u2019d have a lot more fantasy appeal if Will Barton wasn\u2019t getting at least 20 minutes night.\n\nGarrett Temple Kings 25% (and Arron Afflalo) - I\u2019m not a big Temple guy and there\u2019s really no one from the Kings that I love filling in for Rudy Gay, who\u2019s out for the season with a blown Achilles. But Temple appears to be the best of the bunch, getting 32 minutes with 8.0 points, 2.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.8 3-points on 34 percent shooting over his last five games. Teammate Arron Afflalo might be a better flier, as he\u2019s coming on and averaging 14 points, 1.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.0 3-pointers over his last three games, knocking down 9-of-15 shots in 34 minutes a night in the process.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steve Alexander"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Wired: Top NBA Pickups Week 15","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fairfield","zipCode":"06901","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stamford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roto World","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665003","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"95"},"name":"Roto World","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rotoworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/docktora","http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_6856b_1580c_&affid=4892&siteid=6856&adid=1580&c="],"sequenceId":"695202082400","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.rotoworld.com/images/photos/NBA/MIA/NBA_Waiters_300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  \n \nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n \nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their dominant win in Wellington. \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NZ Sevens team happy to leave Wellington and lick their wounds","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dominion Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Dominion Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Rugby","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202089488","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In five years, what we say and write will be indicators of our mental health and physical wellbeing. Patterns in our speech and writing analyzed by cognitive systems will enable doctors and patients to predict and track early-stage developmental disorders, mental illness and degenerative neurological diseases more effectively. \n \nHyperimaging and AI will give us superhero vision. In five years, our ability to \"see\" beyond visible light will reveal new insights to help us understand the world around us. This technology will be widely available throughout our daily lives, giving us the ability to perceive or see through objects and opaque environmental conditions anytime, anywhere. \n \nMacroscopes will help us understand Earth's complexity in infinite detail. The physical world before our eyes only gives us a small view into what's an infinitely interconnected and complex world. Instrumenting and collecting masses of data from every physical object, big and small, and bringing it together will reveal comprehensive solutions for our food, water and energy needs. \n \nMedical \"labs on a chip\" will serve as health detectives for tracing disease at the nanoscale. New techniques that detect tiny bioparticles found in bodily fluids will reveal clues that, when combined with data from the Internet of Things (IoT) will give a full picture of our health and diagnose diseases before we experience any symptoms. \n \nSmart sensors will detect environmental pollution at the speed of light. Environmental pollutants won't be able to hide thanks to new sensing technologies that utilize silicon photonics to accurately pinpoint and monitor the quality of our environment. Together with physical analytics combined with artificial intelligence, these technologies will unlock insights to help us prevent pollution and fully harness the promise of cleaner fuels like natural gas. \n \n\"The combination of data explosion and exponential computation growth over the past fifty years has opened up whole new challenges for us to work on and solve together - challenges we never could have tackled or even foreseen in the past. This 'digital disruption' is transforming the world around us,\" said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director, IBM Research. \n \n\"As our latest 5 in 5 predictions show, there is no challenge too big - or too small - for us to set our sights on if we're only bold enough to take the chance,\" he added. - TradeArabia News Service \n \nآ© Copyright 2014 www.tradearabia.com \n \n(c) 2017 2016 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Warm the oil mixture in a microwave for 30 seconds and add an egg yolk, mix all the ingredients well and massage the mixture on your hair length.  \nCastor oil and extra virgin coconut oil help in replenishing dry and dull hair, whereas the egg yolk helps in improving the texture, leaving the tresses soft and shiny. \n Banana voluminising mask: Even if you have fine hair, sometimes dryness can occur, specially in winter. To make sure that you hair look hydrated, mix one mashed banana with a few drops of jojoba oil and one egg white.  \nApply this mixture and keep it on for half an hour before rinsing it with warm water. \n Oil massage and towel wrap: Simply apply jojoba oil on your hair whenever you know that your hair feels dry and rough in winters or when you notice that your typical hair care regime is lacking something.  \nMassage the oil into your hair, section by section starting from the scalp to the ends, pack in a warm towel for 15-20 minutes. Rinse, wash and condition as usual.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Revive your dull hair using jojoba oil in winter","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ProKerala.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"261879685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ProKerala.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prokerala.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202093839","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Jayaram. \n \nPRCI National President and Executive Director of Concept PR B.N. Kumar explained: \"The choice of topics for the drive for Indian communication professionals are: Demonetisation: Pain or Gain; Ecological Crisis -- It's forever?; Swachh Bharat -- Fad or reality?; Financial inclusion - On right track?\" \n \nFor international communications professionals, the choices are: Disruption -- A global Phenomenon? and India -- Expectations from an emerging Global Super Power. \n \nThe essays could be in 600 to 1,200 words and the organisers have asked the writers to avoid slander, abusive language and partisan comments.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Hockey League standings. \n \nThe teams were scoreless 15 minutes into the second period when Wilson cashed in a Silverbacks\u2019 power-play chance with Kings defenceman Adam Burnett off for cross-checking. \n \nThe Kings evened the count 17:59 into the second, an even-strength goal from captain Brett Mennear, his team-leading 22 nd of the season. But with 7:56 gone in the third period Wilson hooked up with Josh Latta for the gamewinner. \n \nGrant got to the bench with 70 seconds left but Bolduc, the former Prince George Cougar, ended the suspense at 19:17 with his 14 th goal of the season. \n \nThe Silverbacks outshot the Kings 38-20. Nic Tallarico improved his record to 7-4-2-0 in goal for Salmon Arm. \n \nThe Spruce Kings, who won 3-1 Friday inn Merritt, move on to Vernon, where they face the Vipers Sunday at 2 p.m. With 12 games left in the season, Prince George (20-21-3-2, fourth in the Mainland Division) is now 12 points behind the third-place Rivermen (25-15-5-2), who beat Coquitlam 5-1 Saturday in Langley.   \n \nAlso on Saturday, the Vipers scored three goals in the third period to defeat the visiting Nanaimo Clippers 3-0. That moved Vernon (25-15-4-4) within eight points of the Interior Division-leading Penticton Vees, who lost 6-3 in Trail. \n  \n© Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen  \n'Please support the Prince George Citizen and online news like this by purchasing a digital subscription.'","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Spruce Kings stumble in Salmon Arm","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V2L","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Prince George East Central","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Prince George Citizen","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697132","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Prince George Citizen","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.princegeorgecitizen.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202103682","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A 10-3 run to start the fourth quarter pulled the Bisons even at 54-54 with 6:35 still to play. \n \nMadison Landry\u2019s jump shot put UNBC ahead 64-63 with 28 seconds still to play, but with nine seconds on the clock, Keziah Brothers sunk a lay-up and Rebecca Potter connected on both her foul shots to end the game. \n \nPotter finished with 17 points and Emma Thompson had 16 points and 10 rebounds. UNBC guard Maria Mongomo collected a game-high 23 points and also had seven rebounds, while Vasiliki Louka picked up a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. \n \nDespite the loss, UNBC (6-10) remains in a playoff position, ranked 11 th in the 17-team league.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 47 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"50309","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Des Moines","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCCI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1116"},"name":"KCCI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Health"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcci.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202113109","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Following their deaths, the Haredi community has no spiritual mentor who everybody follows and obeys. \u201cSuddenly, parents have to think for themselves,\u201d said Dvora Wagner, who studied ultra-Orthodox fathers for her doctorate at Bar-Ilan University. Before, the rabbis would tell the parents which schools to choose and whether brothers and sisters could share a room. But now there\u2019s nobody to ask, so they go to parenting class. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nAnother reason the ultra-Orthodox are consulting experts is the change in the way Haredi women work. In the past, they would work in teaching. In the last 10 years, though, they have crossed over into law, software design, architecture, etc. Secular mothers are well aware of the conflict arising between a career and parenting, but now it\u2019s reached their ultra-Orthodox sisters, too. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nThey want self-expression in their career and feel that satisfaction from parenting isn\u2019t enough, said Farkash. They have two jobs \u2013 mother and profession \u2013 so the men are having to become more involved in bringing up the kids. Torah scholars leave their studies at noon, pick up the kids and spend time with them until mom returns from work, when they go back to the study benches. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nThe fathers know they have to do this if the mother is working, said Wagner. It isn\u2019t about feminist ideology or equality in the marriage \u2013 it\u2019s all about the utmost priority, which is studying Torah. For the father to do that, the mother has to work and, if so, he has to help with bringing up the children. \u201cHe might cook and tell them about kashrut laws,\u201d she said. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nWhen baby runs the roost \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nThe ultra-Orthodox community has several sects, each with its own norms.

But as parental authority has weakened, so has the hierarchy. \u201cNow, when a baby is born they say, \u2018Welcome, king,\u2019 and the whole house adapts itself to him. He runs the show,\u201d she said. \u201cHaredi mothers tell me the son comes home, throws his coat on the floor and it doesn\u2019t help to talk to him or punish him \u2013 he won\u2019t put it away. I ask if the son would dare take a fleishig bowl and eat cornflakes with milk out of it. They say no, of course not, that is forbidden. So why should there be doubt in other areas? What\u2019s the difference? When it comes to mitzvahs, there is no question \u2013 and obviously I have the authority to require the child to obey me. There is a divine command, and never mind what the age of the child is, he has to obey. \u2026 You\u2019re not supposed to adapt yourself to the child, on the contrary.\u201d \n\r Three Haredi children in Jerusalem pushing a toddler in a stroller.

For all his demonstrative ways, the Haredi child isn\u2019t the only star of the show; he\u2019s more part of a well-oiled machine. And Haredi children are definitely expected to help in the home \u2013 from setting the table to playing with the little \u2019uns and walking them to school.

Nine-year-old babysitters are part of the ecosystem of an ultra-Orthodox family, but there are parents \u2013 \u201cand in Haredi society, parents are parents, not your best friends.\u201d \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nIn her family, respect for the parents was demonstrated: \u201cWhen my father came into the room, my brother would rise to his feet.

In the secular world, they may well help with the kids, diapering them and babysitting, and so on. In the ultra-Orthodox world, though, they may not be actually through with the child-rearing stage themselves and can\u2019t help. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nOr they find themselves with their own tiny children and their children\u2019s tiny children: in short, the Haredi grandparent may be a burned-out wreck. But their kids may not appreciate that they\u2019re wrung out, and friction can arise that grandma and grandpa don\u2019t \u201chelp enough.\u201d \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nAnother difference is that secular children know how to upload videos to YouTube pretty much from when they can walk, while ultra-Orthodox children are more likely to read books and be playing in the street. Haredi parents try to keep the children away from technology even if they themselves are exposed to it. They may have internet connectivity at home for work, but undesirable content will be filtered. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nHowever, while secular children learn a great deal from television and the internet, ultra-Orthodox parents themselves have to teach their children things beyond school by other means, says Dina, 31, a Hasidic Jew. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nValues in ultra-Orthodox schools differ, too: modesty, love of learning, compassion, contributing to the family and community, etc. Individualism and competitiveness, so common in secular circles, are practically anathema to the ultra-Orthodox. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \nBasically, the Haredi parent is terrified that their child will go to the secular dogs \u2013 watching mainstream movies, running around malls, wearing improper clothing (like black jeans) \u2013 and that small sins will pile up to the point where the child leaves the faith. The secular equivalent might be a child who becomes addicted to drugs. \n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r \n\u201cIt\u2019s a stain on the whole family,\u201d Deutsch explained. \u201cI had a woman customer whose son divorced and left the faith, and the second one started playing around.

Wenger also admitted that he wasn\u2019t sure if Welbeck would be able to recover from his series of injuries while talking to the official website . \n  \n\n  \n\u201cI knew that he worked very hard, but you never know how much efficiency there will be to transfer that into a competitive game. I think it was great to see that he hasn\u2019t lost his runs, he hasn\u2019t lost his finishing. It shows as well, when you are able to transform that frustration of not playing into efficiency, that\u2019s a special guy.\u201d \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not a medical specialist but you hope that it will all go well after he comes back after the second surgery. He became even more resilient and worked even harder. He\u2019s highly respected inside the club because he has shown so much dedication, never moaned, worked very hard and tonight everybody is delighted for him.\u201d \n   \nArsenal\u2019s English striker Danny Welbeck (R) celebrates scoring his team\u2019s first goal with Arsenal\u2019s English defender Kieran Gibbs during the English FA Cup fourth round football match between Southampton and Arsenal at St Mary\u2019s in Southampton, southern England on January 28, 2017. (Photo by ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/) \n  \nWelbeck is a popular figure both inside and outside of Arsenal and many neutrals will be pleased to see him make a successful return to action. The Englishman looked lively as Arsenal dismantled Southampton and will definitely provide a boost to the Gunners as they look to close the gap to Chelsea. \n \nTheo Walcott\u2019s hat-trick will also provide some cheer to Arsenal fans after the winger\u2019s fine form this season was interrupted by a string of injuries.

He was born on February 19, 1918, in The Hauge, a city located on the western coast of the Netherlands.\n\nFeodor is preceded in death by his parents Leendert Willem Coenraad and Betty Regine Oelrichs van den Dool; his wife and the love of his life, Gertrude, and his second wife, Alice van den Dool; two brothers Case and Lein and one sister, Betty.\n\nFeodor is survived by a daughter, Anita van den Dool and Melody Rountree; a son, Philip van den Dool and his wife Linda; two sisters-in-law, Elly Poelman and Willy van den Born; four grandchildren; great grandchildren, great-great grandchildren, many nieces, nephews, relatives and friends.\n\nIn his most recent years, he was particularly fond of his personal staff of assistants, Shamiko Wilson, Terrie Leager and the Friend family, Barbara, Denise and Gerald.\n\nFeodor is eternally grateful to Barbara Friend; neighbor, Antonio Perez, and members of the Tulsa Fire Department who in 2015 rescued him and Barbara from a devastating house fire that destroyed his home.\n\nFeodor was a lifelong member of the Southminster Presbyterian church in Tulsa and at the time of his passing, was the oldest living member of the church where his children were baptized.\n\nFeodor served in the Dutch military in the years leading up to World War II. When Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands, Feodor led an \"underground\" resistance movement by providing the allies with vital information to help with the war effort.\n\nFeodor was a radio operator and actually built the radio he used to transmit information of the German activities to the allies. Remarkably, Feodor actually rode a stationary bike to generate power for the radio transmissions. Had Feodor's activities been discovered by the Germans, it would have meant certain death.\n\nAfter the war, much of the Netherlands lie in ruins from the Nazi bombing campaigns; housing was limited, so Feodor and his new bride made a decision to start a new life and family in America.\n\nFeodor was offered a position as an electronics technician with Magnecord in Chicago in 1955. Magnecord was later acquired by Midwestern Instruments which relocated to Tulsa. Midwestern Instruments was then acquired by Telex, where Feodor retired at age 70.\n\nOn October 9, 1963, Feodor and his wife Gertrude, would become citizens of the United States of America. It was to be one of his proudest accomplishments. As a fitting tribute, Feodor cast a vote in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nFeodor was an avid ham operator and member of the Broken Arrow Amateur Radio Club. During his life, he repaired and refurbished reel-to-reel recorders for radio stations all over the country. He also enjoyed camping and fishing, and always insisted on leaving the campground cleaner than he found it.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Tuesday, January 31, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., at the Memorial Park Cemetery Chapel.

Devin Booker added 23.\n\nDenver won despite the absence of center Nikola Jokic, who left with a left hip flexor strain late in Thursday night's 127-120 victory.\n\nThe Nuggets were in the penalty situation with 8:19 still to play in the third quarter.\n\n\"We went to the bonus really early,'\" Gallinari said, \"so we had to take advantage of that and give ourselves a chance to get to the free throw line.\"\n\nThey certainly did.\n\nBledsoe didn't have much to say about the Nuggets' foul-line parade.\n\n\"Ask the refs,\" he said.\n\nThe Suns, not surprisingly, were in foul trouble in the quarter. Starting forwards T.J. Warren and Marquese Chriss had five apiece and Booker four. Denver finished the game 37 of 42 at the line.\n\n\"They do a great job just attacking the rim, attacking the paint, putting themselves in bonus situations,\" Suns coach Earl Watson said. \"Same thing happened in the second (quarter) in the game in Denver. The last few games versus them, they shot 70 free throws.\"\n\nPhoenix went to the line more than a few times, too. The Suns were 24 of 32, led by Bledsoe's 14 of 15.\n\nJameer Nelson added 17 points for the Nuggets and Gary Harris 15.\n\nDenver outscored the Suns 36-22 in the third quarter and was up 95-76 when Wilson Chandler scored inside with 1:02 to play. The Suns scored the final seven points of the period to cut Denver's lead to 95-83 entering the fourth.\n\nBut Phoenix never got closer than seven in the final 12 minutes.\n\n\"We played defense,\" Faried said. \"We got back into it, got to the free throw line, we got back in transition. They were getting a lot of open shots and we isolated them and tried to make them take tough shots.\"\n\nEarly, the Suns were off and running.\n\nThey used a 19-3 first-quarter run to go up 29-13 on Brandon Knight's 10-foot floater. The first quarter ended with Phoenix up 33-21 and the Nuggets shooting 33 percent (7 for 21).\n\nBut Denver got it going in the second, outscoring the Suns 15-5 to tie it at 44 when Gallinari converted a three-point play with five minutes left in the half. Denver never quite caught the Suns the rest of the half. Bledsoe's two free throws with 7.6 seconds to play put Phoenix up 61-59 lead at the break.\n\nKnight struggled through a 1-for-8 shooting night and his team's point differential was a staggering minus-32 when he was on the floor.\n\nBledsoe's previous career high was 40 set in Toronto on Jan. 22.. ... Booker scored at least 20 for the 12th straight game, the first player to do so in his first or second season since Blake Griffin did it 14 in a row in 2010-11. ... Phoenix was without rookie Dragan Bender for the third straight game with right ankle soreness.\n\nPhoenix is home against Memphis on Monday night.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Phoenix Suns news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Denver Nuggets news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Bledsoe scores 41 but Nuggets beat Suns again","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"FOXNews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169589579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7648"},"name":"FOXNews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.foxnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202120471","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/sports/2017/01/29/bledsoe-scores-41-but-nuggets-beat-suns-again/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1485676485684.jpg?ve=1"}],"video":[]}}

Gene was the only child of Sophronia Hassell Selby and Leo Selby. He was born on December 29, 1933, in Sperry, Oklahoma. He spent his early childhood in Osage County west of Skiatook. He attended Skiatook High School and graduated in 1952. He married Flossie M. Switzner on October 18, 1957. His only child, Lora, was born on January 6, 1961. He was employed by Oklahoma Tire and Supply Company (OTASCO) at their warehouse in north Tulsa for 15 years.\n\nDuring their years in Skiatook, he was Skiatook's first Chief of Civil Defense now known as Emergency Management and was very active in citizen band (CB) radios. Gene had a mechanical talent and his curiosity of electronics drove his obsession with scanners and communication equipment. He organized several CB Radio Clubs and always kept an ear to the police and fire communication on his scanners. Early in their marriage, Gene and Flossie answered the calling to be missionaries in their own land. They helped to establish and strengthen six Southern Baptist churches in Oklahoma: Immanuel, Skiatook First Baptist, Oak Hill, Sycamore, Sageeyah and Bethel. Gene was ordained a deacon in 1966 and served as deacon in these churches.\n\nIn the early seventies, the Army Corp of Engineers planned for flood control of the Hominy and Bird Creek watershed, which included purchasing his family's farm on Hominy Creek. He and Flossie had fallen in love with the Ozarks and searched for property on which they could pioneer a business. Through friends in Cape Fair, in 1976, they found and purchased their property on Y-40 now known as Buttermilk Spring Rd. In 1979, they built their home and the store building and started their dream of operating their own business -- a caf and general grocery store on the lake, and named it Selby's Cedar Ridge.\n\nMemorial service:\n\nSaturday, February 4, 2017 2:00 pm\n\nCedar Ridge Baptist Church\n\n742 Buttermilk Spring Rd\n\nGalena, MO 65656\n\nIn lieu of flowers, we prefer donations to Cedar Ridge Baptist Church, 742 Buttermilk Spring Rd, Galena, MO 65656 or to Y Hwy Cemetery c/o Doti Wenners, 681 Hardin Hills Dr., Galena, MO 65656 or a charity of your choice. www.stumpfffuneral.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Genetics news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Obituaries","group":"Society"}],"title":"Gene Selby","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Tulsa","zipCode":"74103","state":"Oklahoma","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tulsa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tulsa World","feed":{"genre":"Obituaries","tags":[],"id":"169668189","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3536"},"name":"Tulsa World","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tulsaworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.stumpfffuneral.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202121517","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/a6/da630c81-19a4-5885-b7e4-752c7a8f788a/588d76e6542b6.image.jpg"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/a6/da630c81-19a4-5885-b7e4-752c7a8f788a/588d76e6542b6.image.jpg?resize=275%2C416"}],"video":[]}}

He passed from this life January 23, 2017, at the age of 92. When he was a baby, his family moved to Tulsa where he attended public schools and graduated from Will Rogers High School. Upon graduation he joined the U.S. Army Air Force, following his older brother to serve in WWII, and was stationed in England. It was during the war that Howard felt called to the ministry. Upon returning from the war he studied at Tulsa University where he met his future wife, Trudy McWilliams. One year later, when he graduated from TU, they married at St. Paul's Methodist church and moved to Dallas, TX, where he attended Perkins School of Theology and Trudy completed her bachelor's degree at SMU.\n\nWhen Howard graduated from seminary, he and Trudy began their life together in the United Methodist Church. Early in his career he pastored churches in Kellyville, Colbert, Calera, and Tishomingo. He served as pastor at 8th Street in Oklahoma City, Asbury in Ponca City, East Cross in Bartlesville, Elk City Methodist, New Haven in Tulsa, 1st Methodist in Ardmore, and Chapel Hill in Oklahoma City. He also served in conference leadership positions as conference council director and also district superintendent for the Stillwater and Tulsa districts. For many years he was active in both jurisdictional and general conference sessions of the United Methodist Church. When he retired from the ministry he and Trudy moved back to Tulsa, where they had both grown up, and began the next phase of their life together. In 1998 he ran for the US Congress as the Democratic candidate against incumbent Steve Largent. Howard lost the election but he gained the endorsement of the Tulsa Daily World, something that made him proud. His family was awed by his courage to run for office to try and improve the world. Through that experience he and Trudy made some life-long friends in the Democratic Party. He and Trudy were active in Boston Avenue United Methodist Church, which was a second family for them. They were active in Meals-On-Wheels, Exodus House, Great Decisions, as well as numerous other causes. Howard believed strongly in the importance of interfaith collaboration and was actively involved in Tulsa Metropolitan Ministries, even serving in leadership roles over the years. Howard loved golf, they enjoyed traveling, and were active participants in the lives of their grandchildren, attending countless athletic events, theatre productions, band concerts, confirmations, celebrations, and family activities. They loved their life at Crestwood in the Oklahoma Methodist Manor and the family is deeply indebted to the entire staff at OMM for the care they showed Howard when Trudy died. We especially thank Dr. Arivn Lade and the nursing staff on Cobbs Landing, who cared for Howard with such love in the last few months.\n\nHoward is survived by his sister, June Hill of Denver, CO; his three children and their families: daughters, Donde Plowman and her husband, Dennis Duchon of Lincoln, NE, Sandy Plowman Kraus and her husband, Phil of New York City, son, Tom Plowman and his wife, Sarah of Austin, TX; grandchildren, Kevin Ashmos, Chijioke Onuoha, Preston and Spencer Kraus, Katie Thompson and her husband, John, and Zachary Plowman. Howard also leaves behind his 8-month old great-granddaughter Gray Isabelle Thompson, his nephews and nieces and their families. Howard was preceded in death by his wife, his grandson, Christopher R. Ashmos, his parents, and his brother, Homer W. Plowman. He was the rock, the constant, the optimistic and encouraging force in all of our lives.\n\nA celebration of Howard's life will be held at 3 p.m. Saturday, February 4, 2017, at Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in Tulsa. In lieu of flowers, friends may contribute in Howard's memory to the Oklahoma Methodist Manor at www.ommtulsa.org or Boston Avenue United Methodist Church at www.bostonavenue.org\n\nNinde Funeral & Cremation,\n\n(918) 742-5556 www.ninde.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Obituaries","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Howard Lee Plowman","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Tulsa","zipCode":"74103","state":"Oklahoma","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tulsa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tulsa World","feed":{"genre":"Obituaries","tags":[],"id":"169668189","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3536"},"name":"Tulsa World","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tulsaworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.ommtulsa.org/","http://www.bostonavenue.org/","http://www.ninde.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202123322","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/92/f92c2697-333b-5bd8-b7ec-0c50b39add9c/588d76e28b71e.image.jpg?resize=418%2C630"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/92/f92c2697-333b-5bd8-b7ec-0c50b39add9c/588d76e28b71e.image.jpg?resize=300%2C452"}],"video":[]}}

This paper stringently analyzes the best and worst states of power systems given the uncertainties of N - k contingency and interval load. For the sake of simplification and tractable computation, an approximate direct current (DC) power flow model was used. Rigorous optimization models were established for identifying the worst and best scenarios considering the contingencies of generators and transmission lines together with their uncertain loads. It is very useful to identify the worst N - k contingencies with interval loads. If the worst existing scenario meets security standards, all scenarios must satisfy it. The mathematical model established for finding the worst N - k contingency with interval load is a bi-level optimization model. In this paper, strong duality theory and mathematical linearization were applied to the solution of bi-level optimization. The computational results of standard cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate that generator contingency has more impact on minimum load shedding than transmission line contingency. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

It was tested whether the chosen indicators are sensitive to the information conveyed, and if this varies as a function of in-group identification. Study 1 ( N = 134) focused on unfavourable feedback (i.e., being told that one has a larger ecological footprint than the average member of a reference group). People who received unfavourable feedback reported stronger intentions to choose eco-friendly travel options than those who received nondiscrepant feedback, when in-group identification was high (not moderate or low). Perceived self- and collective efficacy were not associated with the feedback. Study 2 ( N = 323) extended the focus on favourable feedback (i.e., being told that one has a smaller ecological footprint than the average member of a reference group). Neither unfavourable nor favourable feedback was associated with behavioural intentions, self- or collective efficacy. This means that Study 2 failed to replicate the finding of Study 1 that behavioural intentions were associated with unfavourable feedback, given that in-group identification is high. The findings are discussed in light of the existing literature. Suggestions are made for future studies investigating social comparison feedback as a means to motivate people to make eco-friendly travel choices. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, hit back at President Donald Trump's sudden executive order on immigration, with some leaders calling it immoral and un-American. \n \nTrump's order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard. \n \nNetflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings called it \"a sad week\" and added: \"It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\" \n \nApple Inc CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Trump's order was \"not a policy we support\" and promised to help affected employees. \n \n\"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company,\" Cook added. \n \nElon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Trump, said on Twitter: \"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\" \n \nAirbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said: \"Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right and we must stand with those who are affected.\" \n \nAirbnb will provide free housing to anyone not allowed into the United States, Chesky said. \n \nAaron Levie, the outspoken founder and CEO of online storage company Box Inc, said: \"The executive order on immigration is immoral and antithetical to our values.\" \n \nSTRANDED \n \nFriday's order could be a major headache for tech companies, potentially leaving employees stranded overseas and unable to return to the United States. \n \nAlphabet Inc's Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States. \n \nCEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive. \n \nOne Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal U.S. residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said. \n \n\"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,\" Google said in a statement. \n \nMicrosoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held U.S. work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order. \n \nHe said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected. \n \n\"As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system,\" Smith said in the post. \"We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\" \n \nUber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick, who has faced criticism from some employees for participating in President Trump's business advisory council, said in a statement that the company would compensate drivers from the seven countries who might not be able to return to the United States for three months or more. He said the company knew of about a dozen affected employees. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump\u2019s first business advisory group meeting,\" Kalanick said. \n \nFacebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Friday that was \"concerned\" about the order and voiced support for immigrants.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Tim Cook, Elon Musk and Others Sound Alarm Over Trump Immigration Order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"News18.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590783480","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"31"},"name":"News18.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news18.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202129646","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Buffs controlled the game on the defensive end, holding the Ducks almost 15 points under their season average as well as on the offensive end, becoming just the third school this season to score over 70 points on their defense. \"I'm not sure if we could have won that game without him tonight\". \n \nThis year's Oregon Ducks (14-6, 4-4 Pac-12) have struggled with maintaining consistency throughout much of the season. \n \n\"I think that's the Colorado basketball team we all know and love that showed up tonight\", head coach Tad Boyle said. \n \nThe first half would be a play from behind battle.

Brooks finished with 9 points. \n \nFor a while, his stroke of madness seemed to work well enough as the Buffs gained an early lead on the Beavers, but the visitors weren't ready to turn over easily.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Weak e-waste regulations and limited use of safety measures for e-waste workers in Accra, Ghana, foster an exploitative environment within the industry, and pose health risks for those working and living near e-waste processing sites. This paper presents an integrated review of over 40 e-waste studies specific to Accra, with particular emphasis on the well-studied e-waste processing site in Agbogbloshie, and synthesizes the existing research base across interdisciplinary themes of human health, environmental health, globalization, trade and informalization, and public policy. Despite significant international attention to Accra\u2019s e-waste problem, loopholes within international environmental regulations and treaties provide few incentives and resources for Ghana to strengthen protections for human and environmental health. After a decade of e-waste research in Accra, the crisis continues to intensify; we present a renewed vision for sustainable e-waste policy reform in Ghana and beyond. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

FSU also suffered a 22-point defeat at Georgia Tech on Wednesday. \n \nThe Seminoles (18-4, 6-3 Atlantic Coast Conference)  looked well on their way to another head-scratching blowout loss, down 18 points at halftime to the Orange. \n \nBut Leonard Hamilton depended on his best four players in Isaac, Bacon, Rathan-Mayes and sophomore forward Terance Mann with senior center Jarquez Smith to mount a comeback. \n \nFSU trimmed Syracuse\u2019s lead down to two points after a Bacon 3-pointer with 1:48 left, but the Seminoles simply ran out of energy at the end of the game. \n \nThe crowd in the Carrier Dome rushed the floor to celebrate while the Seminoles lost their second straight game to an unranked, in-conference team after winning 5 of 6 against top 25 teams. \n \nFSU falls in a third-place tie in the conference standings with Notre Dame, which lost at Georgia Tech on Saturday, behind North Carolina and Virginia. \n \nThe Seminoles will play their third straight road game at Miami on Wednesday. \n  \nEmail Safid Deen at  sdeen@orlandosentinel.com .

The court\u2019s decision, which will affect people who have been detained in airports, came after the ACLU and other activist groups filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqis who were held at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York as a result of the order. \n \n\u201cI hope Trump enjoys losing. He\u2019s going to lose so much we\u2019re going to get sick and tired of his losing,\u201d ACLU national political director Faiz Shakir told Yahoo News shortly after the decision was announced. \n \nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the court ruling. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, which he signed on Friday afternoon, barred people from Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Somalia from entering the United States for 90 days. It also stopped all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and indefinitely suspended the entry of refugees from Syria. As a result of the order, some people with current visas have already been detained or turned around at airports. \n \nThe class action lawsuit sought an immediate injunction barring the Trump administration from blocking immigrants based on the executive order. It argued that the order violates a 1965 law that banned discrimination in immigration based on national origin.  According to a copy of the court decision from Judge Ann Donnelly, it will stop officials  from removing individuals with approved refugee applications, holders of valid visas and people from the affected countries who have been authorized to enter \u2014 pending completion of a hearing on the matter in court. Donnelly also wrote that the lawsuit would have a \u201cstrong likelihood of success.\u201d \n \n  \n \n\u201cThere is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017 executive order,\u201d Donnelly said. \n \nShakir said the stay will affect those who are \u201ccurrently detained in airports\u201d and that the ACLU\u2019s lawyers \u201cwill continue litigating the rest of the people impacted\u201d by the order. \n \nTrump\u2019s order has led to large protests at airports around the country. Critics charge that it amounts to a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d while Trump and his team have maintained that the order is not designed to target any specific religion and is merely aimed at terror-prone nations. \n \nYahoo News asked White House press secretary Sean Spicer about the order during his briefing on Wednesday. He framed it as a \u201cnecessary step\u201d for dealing with people from countries that have \u201ca propensity to do us harm.\u201d During his presidential bid, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the U.S. That proposal subsequently evolved into a vague promise of \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d \n \nTrump touted the executive order while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday. He said the scenes in the airports were evidence of its success. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared. It\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\u201d Trump said, according to a White House press pool report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Part of Trump immigration order blocked by judge","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hamilton","zipCode":"37403","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chattanooga","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Chattanooga Times Free Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665183","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2609"},"name":"Chattanooga Times Free Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesfreepress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202152344","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

What a season it was. Even before the primaries were over, we were already grasping at historical precedents from previous elections just to come to grips with what was happening before our eyes, and what our collective future could look like. \n\nThis is especially true among economists, as we have the unenviable task of trying to predict the economic future based upon this election. \n\nSome pundits pointed to examples as recent as Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980, while others go back as far as 1828, when Andrew Jackson won what probably stands as the ugliest mudslinging match of the pre-Twitter era. What most of these previous examples have in common with each other and with 2016 is a healthy dose of populism. \n\nIn fact, you could even say that 2016 had a double dose of populism, with both Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders running decidedly antiestablishment campaigns fueled by underlying populist sentiments. \n\nGranted, these are two very distinct movements, but they both speak to the same truth, just in different ways. After all, what makes populist movements so popular in the first place is that in most cases they are based in at least some truth. Often it's an incomplete truth, but truth all the same. \n\nThe truth underlying these movements in the 2016 campaign was that the gap between the haves and have-nots has grown larger, and too many Americans feel left behind. What the 2016 election reminded us, though, was that you can have two very different reactions to the same truth. \n\nFor the Trump movement, the reaction was protectionism. \n\nFor the Sanders movement, the reaction was socialism. \n\nThe question remains, however: Is populism ultimately good or bad for the economy, and what will it mean to America over the next four years? \n\nMy go-to answer as a two-handed economist is: It depends. \n\nThe results of unadulterated populism can be very bad, including a devolution into any number of other \"isms\" incompatible with liberal democracy. At its extreme, populism is essentially mob rule. \n\nIt's what the Founding Fathers hoped to avoid when they established a republican government in which the people were represented by wise, learned representatives advocating and governing on behalf of the people. To head off autocracy, the opposite of unadulterated populism, the Founding Fathers made those same representatives directly answerable to the people. \n\nAmerican government is designed so that those two groups cannot operate independently of one another, at least not for very long. The representatives need the people, and the people need their representatives. When that relationship breaks down, bad things can happen. Particularly, when the establishment loses its ear for the concerns of everyday Americans, populist movements can arise. \n\nBut does that make populism good or bad? Certainly unadulterated populism is bad, but so is unadulterated elitism. Both a $15-per-hour federal minimum wage and a trade war with China would be damaging to our economy. But the fact that both of those populist proposals from opposite ends of the political spectrum are even making their way into everyday conversation is a sign to the more moderate political mainstream to refocus their efforts onto the concerns of the average American. \n\nPopulism is a check on elitism in the same way that the people are a check on their elected officials. The 2016 election reminded us of too many ugly truths still prevalent in the United States. Those truths have manifested themselves in populist movements that have garnered the attention of every elected official in the United States. The encouraging thing about 2016 is that it reaffirmed the ability of everyday people to get the establishment's attention, even with all the money in the world working against them. \n\nSo even if none of the specific policy measures put forth by the more extreme populist movements on both sides of the political spectrum are actually enacted, the fact that they are being discussed is a victory for the populists, and America, in and of itself. \n\nPresident Trump, as a newcomer the likes of which the Oval Office has never before seen, has the potential to play a unique role in reconciling populist aims with establishment means. Establishment forces in Congress, of both parties, have the potential to refocus mainstream political arguments toward the most pressing concerns of everyday Americans. If the so-called political establishment can use 2016 as a wake-up call instead of a call to arms, it might be just what we needed to awaken us from the floundering status quo. \n\n@DanWhiteEcon daniel.white@moodys.com .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Commentary: Can Trump reconcile populist aims with establishment means?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202153862","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"caption":"Temple students protesting.

It responded favorably, presenting fans acts such as American Alpha, The Revival, DIY and, of course, Shinsuke Nakamura. \n \nWhile the brand lost a great deal of talent in the brand extension, it continued to soldier on, enlisting the likes of Bobby Roode, Eric Young and Roderick Strong to help with its continued revolution of the sports-entertainment landscape. \n \nThere were still superb individual performances and five-star classics, whetting its fans' appetites for outstanding professional wrestling. \n \nAs the brand prepared to make its first mark on 2017 with TakeOver: San Antonio, it looked back at the year that was and paid tribute to the men and women who helped make it another extraordinary one for NXT with these year-end awards, revealed during Saturday's Kickoff Show. \n   NXT Tag Team of the Year  \n2 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  American Alpha  TM-61  The Authors of Pain  The Revival  DIY  \n  \n Winner  \nThe Revival \n \n  \n Analysis  \nIt may have been a temptation to choose DIY here considering their phenomenal performance in November's championship match, but in the end, fans made the only choice they could by selecting The Revival as 2016 Tag Team of the Year. \n \nScott Dawson and Dash Wilder are a throwback to tag teams of yesterday, the closest thing to a replica of the Andersons that today's audience will ever see. \n \nTheir work with American Alpha, Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady, and DIY helped solidify NXT's tag team division as the best in all of WWE. \n   Breakout Star of the Year  \n3 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  No Way Jose  Ember Moon  Andrade \"Cien\" Almas  Peyton Royce and Billie Kay  Sanity  \n  \n Winner  \nPeyton Royce and Billie Kay \n \n  \n Analysis  \nRoyce and Kay campaigned hard for this award, showing off their heelish personalities in several social media videos. \n \nTheir win here is a great sign for the devious duo, who would wrestle their biggest and most significant match to date Saturday night, an NXT Women's Championship Fatal 4-Way match with Asuka and Nikki Cross. \n \nThe lead heels in a rebuilding division, they have gotten over with an NXT audience that wants to see them get destroyed. \n \nSeeing as how that is their job in that role, it is hard to argue with their progression to this point. 2017 should be a big year for the Aussies.   \n   Female Competitor of the Year  \n4 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  Bayley  Nia Jax  Asuka  \n  \n Winner  \nAsuka \n \n  \n Analysis  \nWho can argue with Asuka's victory here given how completely dominant she was in 2016? \n \nShe beat down and sent packing the most beloved star in NXT history in Bayley.

Research suggests a growing proportion of online social activity is \u2018dark\u2019, driven by the rise of chat or mobile-focused messenger apps, such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line and WeChat. \n \n\u201cThe emergence of chat functionality on smartphones has gone beyond the simple sharing of messages and pictures, and has become a complete ecosystem for consumers. This has the potential to provide a wealth of data touchpoints for organizations to tap into, but many of these touchpoints are contained within private networks creating a challenge for marketers,\u201d said Jason Warnes, Digital Marketing Partner at Deloitte Digital . \n \n\u201cThe rise of \u2018dark social\u2019 has two major implications for marketers. First, there may be an impact on social listening techniques and the quality of information available from monitoring \u2018open\u2019 social platforms. And second, there is expected to be a move away from \u2018real time\u2019 social strategies towards conversation-based approaches,\u201d added David Tiltman, Head of Content at Warc . \n \nKey insights that will impact marketers include: \n #1. \u2018Dark Social\u2019 Levels Vary: \nAccording to a RadiumOne research study, 84 percent of social sharing happens via \u2018dark social\u2019 platforms such as email, copy-and-paste links in instant messaging apps and texting. However, 90% of social marketing investment is on public platforms \u2013 making \u2018dark social\u2019 a potential area of opportunity for marketers. Dark social sharing by consumers varies wildly by category with the automotive category ranked the highest at 82.4 percent, followed by finance (72.1 percent), FMCG (61 percent) and retail (56.3 percent). \n \n#2. Brands May Be Missing Out On Insights: \n\u2018Dark social\u2019 may be a better reflection of a consumer\u2019s true feelings than comments posted on public platforms where a consumer may be presenting a particular persona or image. As such, it is becoming increasingly challenging for brands to build a holistic understanding around key buzz topics in the category they operate in, as well as picking up direct buzz around respective brands, products and campaigns. \n \n#3. Link Shorteners \u2013 The Low Tech Way: \nThere are various steps brands can take to track sharing in \u2018dark social\u2019 channels. Shortened URLs can encourage people to share using trackable links. And \u2018cross-comparing\u2019 spikes in dark social with popular content themes might offer new insights regarding the subjects that attract the highest number of shares, as well as identifying the topics of particular interest to online audiences. \n \n#4. From Social Marketing To Conversations: \nChatbots are becoming more than CRM platforms; they are increasingly able to answer consumer questions at all stages of the customer journey. Designing for conversational experiences will require a completely new approach to branding combining complex data management, Artificial Intelligence and a brand\u2019s tone of voice. \n \n#5. Successful Chatbot Initiatives: \nNumerous brands are already exploring whether chatbots can boost their business. Marketers experimenting with chatbots are advised to identify the precise consumer needs which chatbots can fulfill for a brand, and consider which platform(s) may be most appropriate in the short term (for testing) and the long term (for reaching a brand\u2019s target audience). \n \n#6. Where To Deploy Chatbots: \nThe chatbot industry is growing at a rapid rate, with many ways for marketers to design and implement this type of CRM. Marketers will, however, need to consider their consumers and industry when designing their approach to chatbots. For example, it remains to be seen if consumers would trust a chatbot on Facebook with their bank details versus using a bot on their bank\u2019s website, or the website of an established retailer. \n \n#7. How Chat Might Evolve: \nTencent-owned WeChat is setting the bar for what messaging and social networking will look like in the future. It has developed from a chat app into a mobile lifestyle hub, providing, for example, an ecommerce platform, ticket-booking for restaurants, and cab-hailing. Crucially, it has payment services included, allowing it not just to connect people but also connect people to business. As a result, WeChat has become the platform to which other chat apps are looking for inspiration. \n \nThe post appeared first on AM Marketing, Media, Advertising News in MENA .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sana Mahmud"},"topics":[{"name":"Apps news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Marketing news","group":"Business"}],"title":"The Rise Of \u2018Dark Social\u2019 & Chat Apps Will Impact Marketers","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Arabian Marketer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"537249716","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Arabian Marketer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://arabianmarketer.ae"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202172786","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:55:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://arabianmarketer.ae/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dark-Social.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep.

While the country is tied with Egypt for the largest number of individual billionaires, South Africa's six billionaires are worth a combined $22.7 billion - $7 billion more than Egypt's six billionaires. The richest South African billionaire and the continent's second richest person is diamond magnate Nicky Oppenheimer, who has maintained a low profile since selling his family's stake in diamond giant De Beers to Anglo American for $5.1 billion in cash in 2012. \n \nLuxury goods tycoon Johann Rupert and retail magnate Christoffel Wiese are tied as South Africa's second richest and Africa's fourth richest billionaires, each with a $5.5 billion fortune. Wiese's fortune has dropped $1 billion since the November 2015 Africa list, while Rupert's net worth is down $800 million. \n \nEgypt's richest billionaire is Nassef Sawiris, whose $5.3 billion fortune is up $400 million since November 2015. Sawiris runs OCI, one of the world's largest nitrogen fertilizers. The country's next richest person is his brother Naguib Sawiris, who was Egypt's biggest gainer on the list. His net worth increased $700 million to $3.7 billion. In December 2016, Naguib Sawiris announced that he would be stepping down as CEO of his telecom company, Orasom Telecom Media & Technology. \n \nFORBES counts only two female billionaires in Africa: Angola's Isabel dos Santos - Africa's richest woman with a $3.2 billion fortune, and Nigeria's Alakija. Dos Santos is the daughter of Angola's president, who appointed her as head of Angola's state oil firm Sonangol in June 2016.

His outreach to Merkel comes after his repeated attacks on her during the campaign, during which he blasted the German policy on admitting Syrian refugees for allegedly putting German citizens in danger of terrorist attacks. \n \nTrump is planning to speak later Saturday with French President Franois Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \n \nAhead of Trump\u2019s call with Putin, leaders in Moscow expressed cautious hope that the new American leader could forge stronger ties than former president Barack Obama did. \n \nOn Saturday, Nikolai Patrushev, the influential head of the Russian Security Council, welcomed the first contact. \n \n\u201cWe will await the results, but I believe everything will be positive,\u201d Patrushev said Saturday, according to Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency. \n \nFrom Moscow\u2019s point of view, lifting the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration for interference in the presidential election and Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine would be a good start, as would a reduction of NATO\u2019s military presence near Russia\u2019s borders. \n \nWashington\u2019s European allies, meanwhile, have expressed concern over whether Trump\u2019s first moves with Russia will signal a reduction of the U.S. commitment to European security. \n \nBut Trump, speaking Friday at a White House news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, said that it is \u201cvery early\u201d to discuss lifting sanctions on Russia. May also stated her commitment to keep the sanctions in place until the Minsk Agreement, a plan to end the conflict in Ukraine, has been implemented. And she added that she continues to argue that position \u201cinside the European Union.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s first contact with Putin as president comes after months of speculation over the Kremlin\u2019s role in the 2016 election \u2014 starting with Trump\u2019s frequent expressions of admiration for Putin and culminating in the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia interfered in the campaign on Trump\u2019s behalf. \n \nTrump has vehemently denied allegations that his positive view of Moscow stems from business ties or blackmail by Russian intelligence, and he has sought to portray his upbeat words about Putin as a positive. \n \nHe has consistently argued that Russia can be a strong ally instead of a strategic ally, saying the two countries could cooperate on counterterrorism in general and rolling back the Islamic State in particular, as well as countering nuclear weapon proliferation. Trump has suggested that Washington can work with Moscow on the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine and that he might be ready to negotiate down NATO\u2019s strong defensive posture on Russia\u2019s western border. \n \nU.S. lawmakers from both parties, and others including Trump Cabinet picks, have raised alarms or at least questioned his softer approach to Russia. \n \nBut on Friday, the president expressed more tempered expectations. \n \n\u201cAs far as, again, Putin and Russia, I don\u2019t say good, bad or indifferent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That\u2019s possible. And it\u2019s also possible we won\u2019t. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully.\u201d \n \nOn a grander scale, the Kremlin seems to hope the Trump administration will relax what it sees as a policy of containment since the fall of the Soviet Union left the United States as the world\u2019s sole superpower. In the new world order outlined by Putin, Russia would have greater influence in world affairs and, from Moscow\u2019s point of view, feel more secure at home. \n \nBut Moscow has consistently cautioned about \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d over what Trump\u2019s presidency will mean for Russia, and Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stayed on script Friday. \n \n\u201cOne can hardly expect substantive contacts on the entire range of affairs from this call,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cLet us wait and see. Let us be patient.\u201d \n \nMoscow\u2019s establishment has welcomed Trump as a pragmatist who will not try to enforce American values on the rest of the world. \n \n\u201cHe is a businessman. He is a pragmatic person,\u201d Andrei Norkin, co-host of a popular Russian political talk show, said this week. \u201cI hope that his attitude to foreign policy will be like to some sort of business deal. People who will work with him will be telling him \u2018Mr. President, we are taking a risk here,\u2019 and he will agree.\u201d \n \nFrom The Washington Post","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Telecom news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump phones Putin, Shinzo Abe, Angela Merkel to reset US relations","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Nigerian Voice","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"492814961","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"Nigerian Voice","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thenigerianvoice.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202181835","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Customs Service that the two Bell 412 helicopters handed over to the Nigerian Air Force on Friday in Lagos were imported by yet-to-be-identified importers have been debunked by an investigation report of SUNDAY PUNCH. \n \nThe newspaper reports that that the aircraft were actually ordered for by the Rivers State Government when Rotimi Amaechi was governor. \n \nIt  gathered on Saturday that the current governor of the state, Nyesom Wike, made series of requests for the release of the helicopters to Rivers when he assumed office. \n \nThis is coming just as the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority declared that it was not notified before the helicopters were brought into Nigeria. \n \nDocuments sighted by newspaper showed that in 2015, the state government wrote different letters to the NCS and the Federal Ministry of Finance requesting for the release of the helicopters. \n \nAccording to the report, the Rivers State Government requested for the release of the helicopters in a September 28, 2015 letter from the Office of the Governor and signed by Nyesom Wike, with reference number RVSG/GH/PRES/VOL.1/03, addressed to the Comptroller-General of the NCS, and had the title, 'Request for provisional release of two Bell 412 helicopters imported by the Rivers State Government for security surveillance services.' \n \nIn the letter, the state government said, \u201cWe are all aware of the serious security challenges in the country, part of which is the recurring vandalism of oil pipelines and installations in Rivers State, which to a large extent adversely affect the economy of the country. \n \n\u201cAs part of measures to tackle this challenge, the Rivers State Government has imported two Bell 412 helicopters into the country for aerial monitoring and security surveillance of oil and gas pipelines and other facilities in the state.\u201d \n \nIt stated that the helicopters were fully equipped with night vision capabilities, camera and armoured plating, as well as other sensitive accessories for day and night operations, adding that the aircraft were \u201camong the transactions inherited from the previous administration.\u201d \n \nThe state government stated that the aircraft were \u201cduly imported based on extant import guidelines to which invoice and Form M were duly obtained.\u201d \n \nThe letter further noted that the aircraft were at the time domiciled on the premises of  SAHCOL Limited at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. \n \nIt requested the NCS to release the helicopters \u201cdue to the high sensitivity of the equipment attached to them, and also to avoid unbearable demurrage while awaiting a response from the minister of finance on our application for duty waiver.\u201d \n \nThe letter from the governor's office added, \u201cWe undertake to make full duty payment in the event of a negative response to our pending application for waiver.\u201d \n \nThe NCS replied the letter from the governor's office in an October 7, 2015 letter that was addressed to the Rivers State governor, with reference number NCS/T&T/I&E/077/S.437, and signed by the Comptroller, Import and Exports, Jibrin M. for the Comptroller-General of Customs. \n \n\n \nHelicopter seized by Nigerian Customs Service \nThe NCS, in its reply, told the state government to pursue the issuance of the duty exemption certificate for the helicopters. \n \nThe letter, which was titled, 'Re: Request for provisional release of two Bell 412 helicopters imported by the Rivers State Government for security surveillance services', said, \u201cReference is made to your letter No. RVSG/GH/PRES/VOL.1/03 of 28th September, 2015 on the above subject matter. \n \n\u201cI am directed to notify you, in line with extant import guidelines, to pursue the issuance of the duty exemption certificate, or in the alternative, pay the appropriate duties and apply for duty refund after duty exemption is granted by the minister of finance.\u201d \n \nWike wrote another letter dated December 13,  2015, addressed to the minister of finance with reference number RVSG/GH/PRES/VOL1/05, which was titled, 'Request for Revalidation of expired certificate waiver of import duty, VAT, and all related taxes in respect of the importation of two units of Bell 412 security surveillance helicopters.' \n \nIn the letter, the governor stated that in 2013, the minister granted the state waivers for the importation of Bombardier aircraft (Global Vision 5000 Series), monorail equipment and two units of Bell 412 surveillance helicopters. \n \nHe said, \u201cHowever, the honourable minister is invited to note that the waivers earlier granted on the importation of the two helicopters are yet to be utilised by the state government due to unforeseen circumstances occasioned by the inability of the previous administration to import the helicopters into the country.\u201d \n \nThe governor urged the minister to consider and approve the revalidation of the expired certificate in waiver of import duty, VAT and all other taxes in connection with the importance of the two units of the Bell 412 helicopters. \n \nBut in another letter from the Office of the National Security Adviser, dated November 3, 2016, signed by the Brigadier-General, AT Famadewa, for the NSA, and copied to the governor of Rivers State, as well as the comptroller-general of Customs, which was addressed to the Chief of the Air Staff, the NSA gave approval for the NAF to take custody of the helicopters. \n \nThe NSA, in the letter with reference number NSA/452/S and titled, 'Re: Request for approval to take custody and manage two Bell 412 helicopters', however, said the approval was based on the request of the state. \n \nThe letter from the NSA's office stated, \u201cI am directed to respectfully refer to your correspondence NA/905/D/CAS dated April 21, 2016 on subject. I am to convey the National Security Adviser's approval for NAF to take custody and manage the two Bell 412 helicopters as requested by Rivers State government.\u201d \n \nHelicopters didn't follow civil import procedure \u2014 NCAA \n \nExplaining the standard procedure needed before the importation of an aircraft for civil operations in Nigeria, the spokesperson of the NCAA, Mr. Sam Adurogboye, said, \u201cTo bring a civil aircraft in, NCAA will be notified and a pre-shipment flight inspection carried out. If found suitable, then it will be cleared to be brought in. \n \n\u201cOn arrival, a comprehensive audit will still be carried out on it, especially those for commercial use.\u201d \n \nAdurogboye, however, stated that the authority did not carry out any of the above processes on the controversial helicopters. \n \n'Why helicopters were not released to Amaechi' \n \nSUNDAY PUNCH \u2018s  correspondents gathered that the then Rotimi Amaechi administration had ordered for the helicopters about two years into his tenure. \n \nHowever, it was learnt that when the helicopters, which were said to have been built from scratch, were already in the United States of America, the relationship between Amaechi and then President Goodluck Jonathan had turned sour. \n \nBecause of this, it was learnt that the Amaechi administration was not cleared to bring the two helicopters into the country. \n \nA source, who was part of the administration,  said the aircraft were abandoned at the airport in the US. \n \nThe former Chief Press Secretary to Amaechi, Mr. David Iyofor, said through a text message that the two armoured helicopters belonged to the Rivers State Government, and insisted that all enquiries about the helicopters should be directed to the state government. \n \nBut the NCS on Saturday said it was still searching for those that imported the two helicopters that were seized and handed over to the NAF on Friday. \n \nThe acting Public Relations Officer, NCS, Joseph Attah, told SUNDAY PUNCH that no one had come forward to claim ownership of the helicopter. \n \nHe said, \u201cInvestigation into the siezed aircraft is still ongoing. You know that when something is siezed by customs and that item is something that can be auctioned, then it is auctioned. \n \n\u201cBut in this case, the helicopter is something that is useful to the nation and so, it was given to the Air Force. \n \n\u201cBut despite the fact that it has been handed over to the Air Force, we are still conducting our investigations.\u201d \n \nWike reacts \nWike, on Saturday, however disagreed with the Customs. \n \nHe explained that he had officially written to Buhari, asking that the armoured helicopters be handed over to the NAF and wondered why the NCS claimed that the items were seized. \n \nThe governor added that he wrote the letter following the high duty charged for the items and the refusal of the current administration to grant Rivers the waiver to clear the two armoured helicopters. \n \nWike's position was contained in a statement issued by his Special Assistant to the Rivers State Governor on Electronic Media, Mr. Simeon Nwakaudu, on Saturday. \n \nThe governor spoke during an interview with editors of The Sun at the Government House in Port Harcourt. \n \nThe governor said, \u201cThese helicopters were imported by the previous administration. When I assumed office, we wrote to the Federal Government that it was strictly for security use. What am I going to use armoured helicopters for? \n \n\u201cIn any case, where will the Rivers State Government get money at this time to import armoured helicopters? The previous administration imported it because they had the money. \n \n\u201cI went to the Federal Government to give me a waiver to clear the helicopters, but the Federal Government refused. I wrote a letter to the president and assured him that the helicopters are meant for security purposes, so it should be handed over to the Nigerian Air Force.\u201d \n \nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cI am surprised that they have started propaganda and political falsehood on the said armoured helicopters. What kind of country are they turning Nigeria into? \n \n\u201cWe stated that we cannot pay the custom duties because the helicopters are not for commercial use. They are to be used to monitor the creeks and track criminals. \n \n\u201cI wrote to the President to give the helicopters to the Air Force. It is shocking that the Customs would turn around to claim that they impounded the helicopters. The Chief of Staff to the President admitted that I had done well when I wrote the letter to the President.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Two Bell 412 helicopters seized by Nigerian Customs Service were imported by Rotimi Amaechi, says Gov Wike","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Nigerian Voice","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"492814961","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"Nigerian Voice","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thenigerianvoice.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202182070","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The report and accompanying research, released in conjunction with Futurizon and based on a survey of 6500 consumers, found that consumers are open to the \u2018vast number of potential applications\u2019 for camera photography. \n \nWorking with futurologist Dr Ian Pearson, Sony Mobile explored a number of sectors likely to incorporate smartphone photography and selfies as a technological function in the future. The potential applications were wide-ranging, from theme parks building \u2018selfie-coasters\u2019 that let adrenaline-junkies capture their experience on the latest rides, to shoppers using it as a \u2018virtual personal assistant\u2019 to try on multiple outfits at the touch of a button. \n \n\u201cThe project has given us a real sense of how selfies and video calls have evolved, and why they could be set to transform so many different sectors. At Sony Mobile we face the dual task of designing smartphones that make consumers\u2019 lives easier today, while keeping an eye on what the future holds and being part of driving innovation and change. We have always seen photography as being a key function at the heart of the smartphone and have already advanced front camera technology in our Xperia™ XZ for superior quality photos, so it\u2019s incredibly exciting to find that consumers are ready to embrace selfies for such a wide range of future uses that enhance our everyday lives,\u201d said Jason Smith, Vice President, Middle East & Africa at Sony Mobile Communications . \n \nThe report identified the top 10 ways in which selfies could evolve: \n 1. Socializing:  Taking a selfie with your companions to find out what they really think \n 2. Medical:  Over a quarter of people would prefer to see their GP via a selfie or video call, in the first instance \n 3. Banking : Nearly half of 25-34 year olds would feel more secure if accessing their bank through a \u2018selfie password\u2019 \n 4. Leisure:  Around half of thrill-seekers would like to try a \u2018selfiecoaster\u2019 \u2013 a rollercoaster that puts you in control of capturing your experience on the ride \n 5. Fitness:  selfies that work with AI (Artificial Intelligence) to capture body monitoring e.g. testing heart rates and even suggesting how to improve on technique and how accurately a move is being performed \n 6. Made to Measure:  taking a 3D body image for made-to-measure clothes \n 7. Retail:  using your smartphone camera to try on different outfits suited to your body shape, at the touch of a button \n 8. Social Currency:  paying for entry to the cinema or a tourist attraction through a selfie \n 9. Robots:  Using your smartphone to control drones or robots to take selfies from other or extreme locations \n 10. Home:  Using selfies to secure and access our homes and cars \n \n\u201cThrough this report, it has been fascinating to chart the evolution of selfies and smartphone photography with the team at Sony Mobile. But even more encouraging has been the response from consumers, who have shown they are open to the range of future uses for selfies and video calls,\u201d Dr Pearson added. \n \nAccording to him, the results indicate that selfies are well on their way to transitioning from fad to technological phenomenon, and provide food for thought to a number of industries. \n \nThe post appeared first on AM Marketing, Media, Advertising News in MENA .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Asma Wangde"},"topics":[],"title":"The Future Of Selfies: Beyond The Picture","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Arabian Marketer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"537249716","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Arabian Marketer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://arabianmarketer.ae"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202182314","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:54:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://arabianmarketer.ae/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Future-of-Selfies-Banking.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Genesee","zipCode":"48507","state":"Michigan","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Flint","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperTalk1570.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"542033313","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22"},"name":"SuperTalk1570.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.supertalk1570.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695202184067","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

While more severe, with full bans to all travel through or from these nations, Trump's list was half as long as Obama's. \n \nLebanon, Nigeria, Algeria, Afghanistan were some of the countries lucky to escape Trumps ban. \n \nWhile 15 of the 19 911 airplane hijackers were Saudi Arabian citizens, several reports have criticized Trump for excluding the kingdom which has severally been linked to financing global terror including the 911 attack on US soil . \n \nWhile the US' actions under Obama and Trump may be viewed as extreme or Islamophobic, it is important to note that wealthy Gulf nations that could comfortably assimilate the entire population of refugees have imposed similar bans on refugees from Syria citing security and politico-cultural threats. It is hardly worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia, the Islamic capital and other Arab Gulf states can hardly boast of ever accepting refugees from Sudan, Somalia, Yemen or other Muslim countries. \n \nThe repeated travel restrictions to Muslim nations should prompt a new drive for tolerance and peaceful co-existence as well as urge wealthy Muslim nations to do more for their Muslim brethren. \n \nThe pain for those affected by the bans can hardly be imagined but it is important to put things in perspective and find ways to take advantage of the hard-times to steer a new path in the Muslim world. \n \nDr. Peregrino Brimah; @EveryNigerian","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Nigeria, Saudi Arabia Escape As Trump Restricts Travel For 7 Less Countries Than Obama's 2010 Order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Nigerian Voice","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"492814961","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"Nigerian Voice","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thenigerianvoice.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202184238","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy airport hours after Trump signed the order. \n \nOn Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups filed a legal challenge to Trump's order. \n \nLawyers representing the Iraqi pair also filed a court appeal for their release, saying they were being unlawfully detained. \n \nThe United Nations responded by urging Trump to continue his country's 'long tradition' of welcoming refugees and to ensure their equal treatment, regardless of race, nationality or religion. \n \nFrench President Francois Hollande said Europe must have a 'firm response' to Trump, and 'when he refuses the arrival of refugees, while Europe has done its duty, we have to respond'. \n \nHollande was due to speak with Trump later Saturday. \n \nIn Lebanon, Syrian refugees struggling to get by in makeshift camps bemoaned their fate. \n \n'What on earth have the Syrian people done to deserve this?' asked Abu Mahmoud al-Ghol, at one informal camp in the Marj area. \n \n'And to think it's a democratic country doing it,' the 44-year-old said. \n \nNearly six years of conflict in Syria have driven more than half the population from their homes, with many fleeing abroad and dreaming of new lives in the West. \n \nTrump's executive order specifically says no visas will be issued for 90 days to migrants or visitors from the seven Muslim-majority countries. \n \nIt also bars Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, or until Trump himself decides that they no longer pose a threat. \n \nHis decree suspends the entire US refugee resettlement programme for at least 120 days while tough new vetting rules are established. \n \nQatar Airways, which flies to around 15 American cities, said it would abide by the new regulations, adding however that passengers who have 'the proper documentation' will be able to fly. \n \nAn alert on its website said citizens of the seven barred countries could travel to the US if they have permanent residency there. \n \nGovernment officials and their immediate family are exempt from the travel restrictions along with representatives of international organisations, the Gulf carrier said. \n \nTrump's move has also angered one of Iran's most popular actresses, Taraneh Alidoosti who stars in the Oscar-nominated 'The Salesman'. \n \nShe said she would boycott next month's Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. \n \n'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist,' she tweeted. 'Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017.' - AFP.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump order: Airlines bar Muslims from flights to U.S","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Nigerian Voice","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"492814961","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"Nigerian Voice","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thenigerianvoice.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202185238","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The two greats of the game, who share possibly the greatest rivalry in the history of the game, will take on each other once again, this time in the men's singles final of the 2017 Australian Open on Sunday. Nadal has struggled with injuries, especially his wrist which made him miss Wimbledon last year, and last reached the final of a Grand Slam event in 2014.

It doesn\u2019t detail the other alleged attacks, but says some were recorded by the players, who shared the recordings with friends.\n\nFifty-two assaults would dramatically increase the 17 reports of sexual and physical attacks involving 19 players since 2011 that have been previously acknowledged by Baylor officials.\n\nThe school faces at least five lawsuits from women who allege they were attacked and that the school failed to protect them or ignored their complaints.\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest Baptist university has been gripped by the on-going scandal that led to the firing of football coach Art Briles and the departure of school President Ken Starr last year.\n\nAn internal investigation last year found that the football program operated as if it was \u201cabove the rules\u201d and that assistant coaches and staff interfered or stifled investigations into alleged assaults by players.\n\nBaylor allowed Briles\u2019 staff of assistants to remain for the 2016 season but new coach Matt Rhule hasn\u2019t retained them. Some have moved to new jobs, including Briles\u2019 son and former offensive coordinator, Kendal Briles, to Florida Atlantic, and defensive coordinator Phil Bennett to Arizona State.\n\nIn a statement, Baylor President David Garland said the university had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d in fortifying security measures since the sexual assault scandal erupted last year.\n\n\u201cBaylor University has taken unprecedented actions that have been well-documented in response to the issue of past and alleged sexual assaults involving our campus community,\u201d Garland said. \u201cWe have made great progress in implementing 105 recommendations to strengthen the safety and security of all students and restore faith in the university.\u201d\n\nThe statement did not specifically address the allegations in the new lawsuit.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed Friday, the woman alleges being raped by two players in 2013. The attack was reported to Waco police but no charges were filed and the players were allowed to stay on the team at the time.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, campus officials didn\u2019t investigate her case until 2015. One of the players involved was suspended from the team and later expelled. The other had transferred.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the football program operated under a \u201cshow \u2019em a good time\u201d policy that \u201cused sex to sell\u201d Baylor to high school recruits.\n\nThe woman was a member of a campus group called the Baylor Bruins that would host prospective athletes during visits. The lawsuit alleges that Baylor encouraged making Baylor Bruins available for sex with recruits, as well as taking recruits to strip clubs, implied promises of sex and using alcohol and drugs in the recruiting process.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Baylor suit counts 52 rapes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202193498","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T22:54:40Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Obama administration also sanctioned people in Putin\u2019s inner circle.\n\nShortly before leaving office, President Barack Obama also ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds in the United States and expelled 35 diplomats that he said were really spies. These sanctions followed an assessment by U.S. intelligence that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump become president.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump, Putin talk peace, ISIS","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202193692","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T22:00:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Now, with the U.S. death toll rising, the idea is gaining traction in a number of American cities, including Boston, New York City and Ithaca, New York.\n\nWhile opponents say the sites promote illegal drug use, supporters say they can keep people alive and steer them toward treatment. They compare supervised injection facilities to the needle exchanges that became popular in the 1980s and 1990s as a way to stanch the spread of HIV and hepatitis C among intravenous drug users.\n\n\u201cThese sites save lives, and that is our goal in Seattle/King County,\u201d Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe sites are not currently legal under federal law, according to Kelly Dineen, a professor of health law at Saint Louis University School of Law. A provision of the Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal to operate facilities where drugs are used, she said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a record 33,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2015. Opioids now kill more people each year than car accidents. In 2015, the number of heroin deaths nationwide surpassed the number of deaths from gun homicides.\n\nIn addition to heroin, the deaths are caused by powerful prescription painkillers and fentanyl, a synthetic opiate so potent, a tiny amount can kill people within minutes \u2013 leaving little time for help to arrive.\n\n\u201cIf you want to really bend this curve of death, (safe-injection sites are) going to have to be part of the strategy,\u201d said Jessie Gaeta, chief medical officer of the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, which treats many victims of overdose. In Seattle, the King County Board of Health voted unanimously earlier this month to endorse two sites, one to be located in the city and the other to be located in the surrounding county. Murray and King County Executive Dow Constantine gave them final approval Friday. In 2015, 132 people died of heroin overdoses in the county.\n\n\u201cWe see this as a public health emergency,\u201d said Jeff Duchin, the health officer for Seattle and King County. \u201cClearly the status quo isn\u2019t working anywhere, and clearly we need to look at new tools.\u201d\n\nDuchin said officials hope to open the Seattle site within a year. Both sites will be aimed primarily at homeless drug users, he said, with a goal of providing them basic health services and ultimately drug treatment.\n\n\u201cThe real goal is not to open a day spa where people can come in and have a good time and use drugs, but to engage them in treatment,\u201d Duchin said. \u201cThey inject in a place where there\u2019s a health care worker who can save their lives if they overdose.\u201d\n\nDuchin said all drug users will be supervised at all times. If a person exhibits signs of an overdose, he said, a health care worker will administer naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of opioids.\n\nOver the next three years, officials plan to study the sites and collect data on how many people they attract, whether overdose deaths are being prevented and whether users of the sites enter drug treatment.\n\nPossession of heroin is illegal under federal law, but, Duchin said: \u201cWe\u2019re not really seeing this as a legal problem right now. If there are legal issues that come up, we\u2019ll have to address them.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nKing County Sheriff John Urquhart has been supportive of the idea, though he said the \u201cjury is still out\u201d on whether the sites will reduce the number of overdoses. He said his deputies will not arrest anyone coming to or going from the sites, but he warned that federal officials \u201ccould camp out in front of the site and arrest anyone in possession.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the idea is running into opposition outside the city. State Sen. Mark Miloscia, who represents Federal Way, in the southern reaches of King County near Tacoma, introduced a bill barring safe injection facilities from opening anywhere in the state. It will have a hearing Monday.\n\n\u201cThe people in my district, Democrat or Republican, would come unglued if we put a safe injection site in Federal Way,\u201d Miloscia said. \u201cSaving lives is about getting people off heroin and not tolerating it.\u201d Worldwide, at least 90 facilities have been created to permit people to inject illegal drugs under medical supervision. The first opened in Bern, Switzerland, in 1986. France opened its first facility in October.\n\nA supervised injection site in Vancouver, Canada, is the only such site in North America. After that facility opened in 2003, researchers found that overdose deaths in the surrounding community dropped 35 percent in just two years. Still, British Columbia recorded 914 overdose deaths last year, up 80 percent from 2015.\n\nCloser to home, the New York City Council last year appropriated $100,000 to study opening a safe-injection facility. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee dropped his longtime opposition to the sites, saying recently that he is now \u201copen\u201d to them.\n\nAnd in Ithaca, New York, home to Cornell University, Mayor Svante Myrick has been pushing to bring a site to his city. Myrick\u2019s father suffered from drug addiction.\n\nHe won a recommendation from a city task force last year. But that effort has since stalled amid rising opposition from the city\u2019s police chief and state lawmakers.\n\nCornell law professor William Jacobson has argued that the sites amount to a \u201cgovernment-run heroin shooting gallery,\u201d though he recently acknowledged the sites might help to prevent overdoses.\n\n\u201cThe heroin scourge is real,\u201d Jacobson said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure normalizing the use helps the problem.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, state Sen. William Brownsberger recently introduced legislation to permit safe-injection sites throughout the state.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Katie Zezima"},"topics":[{"name":"Seattle-Tacoma news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Seattle OKs safe sites for addicts to inject","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202193948","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T22:02:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The growing blaze moved the mine to the top of a list of thousands of problem decades-old coal sites in West Virginia awaiting cleanup and vying for limited federal funds.\n\nState officials say $4.5 billion worth of work remains at more than 3,300 sites abandoned by coal companies before 1977, when Congress passed a law establishing a national fund for old cleanups. That program was part of an effort to heal the state from the ravages of an industry that once dominated its economy.\n\n\u201cWest Virginia is right at the top for needs,\u201d said Chuck Williams, head of Alabama\u2019s efforts and past president of the National Association of Abandoned Mine Lands Programs. He said Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia account for the lion\u2019s share of unfinished work among the 28 states and Indian tribes in the program.\n\nDespite being one of the most affected, federal officials have only one-third of West Virginia\u2019s proposed cleanup costs on their $7 billion national list of high-priority work.\n\nThe sites include old mines that leak acidic water into streams and kill wildlife and dangerous holes that attract children. Tunnels and caverns beneath homes also need to be shored up and new water lines are needed where wells are polluted.\n\n\u201cOur program exists to abate health and safety hazards,\u201d said Rob Rice, chief of the West Virginia Office of Abandoned Mine Lands and Reclamation. \u201cWe have so much need. It\u2019s frustrating for us.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental improvements are a secondary but major benefit, he said.\n\n\u201cThis whole area has been extensively mined,\u201d said Jonathan Knight, riding recently through the exurbs east of Morgantown. A planner for the state office, he said housing developments have been built above old mines that many homeowners don\u2019t even know about.\n\nThe state will get $23.3 million from the federal reclamation fund this year, which is replenished by fees on mining companies. The mines pay 12 cents per ton of underground coal mined and 28 cents per ton from surface mining, but the funding has dropped the past three years with a downturn in coal production.\n\nIt will cost about $1 billion just to extinguish all of West Virginia\u2019s 43 fires in abandoned mines, according to the state office. They could have been caused by forest fires, arson, lightning strikes or even old underground explosions that never went completely out.\n\nAbout $5 million will be spent to extinguish the Preston County fire. In October, the office spent $209,400 to cut trees and plug holes feeding the fire with oxygen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more water within mine pools in West Virginia than there is in the lakes of West Virginia,\u201d Rice said. \u201cMore than 2,500 miles of streams are severely degraded because of mine drainage in West Virginia.\u201d\n\nThe federal program is scheduled by law to expire in 2021, leaving behind about $2.5 billion in a trust fund expected to pay for any ongoing work needed by 25 states and three Indian tribes to address problems from pre-1977 abandoned coal mines. West Virginia has set aside about $55 million of its grant money received already for continuing water treatment funded by the interest.

Mayor de Blasio stated \u201cfrom what we\u2019ve heard so far from the medical examiner, it may be a health situation, not anything related to abuse or neglect\u201d (\u201c \u2018Health situation\u2019 may have caused death of Queens boy, 5,\u201d Jan. 25). Is he for real? \n \nThose two so-called parents checked on Little Mikey (they say) at 2:30 a.m. with breathing problems but the mother Phyllis Reinoso said that he seemed fine and then not again for 14 hours, I assume when they decided to wake up \u2014 clearly proving extreme neglect! That would be at 4:30 that afternoon and to top it all off, the child had health problems! That\u2019s not neglect. Are you kidding me? \n \nWe caring parents would, first, never have 13 prior ACS cases; would not leave all those children alone for the 15-year-old to be held responsible day-in and day-out; sleep all day; leave children unsupervised \u2014 and we would constantly check in on them, especially little Mikey because of his health issues. \n \nClearly, this was a total case of abuse and neglect from two people who should never have children under their watch again, ever. They deserve to be in jail and I pray that those poor innocent children will eventually be in the care of loving and responsible guardians. ACS failed them and I hope that the case workers are held responsible and fired, as well as those two so-called parents. And where were the extended family, neighbors and school officials? Not one person cared enough to do the right thing for these innocent victims. \n \nSo please, Mr. Mayor, do not stand there and try to defend the utmost incompetence of ACS just to cover yourself. Sickening and outrageous! Connie Scalice \n ACS\u2019 rap sheet  \nBriarwood: How many more children must die whose families were under investigation by the ACS? Mikey Guzman (Tuesday\u2019s paper), Zamair Coombs (Friday\u2019s), Jaden Jordon in December, Zymere Perkins in the fall. How could this be allowed to continue? Take ACS out of the mayor\u2019s control! Donald Trump, please step in, create a national agency overseeing child protective services for all our cities. Please help the children who need your help so desperately. Patricia Nuzzi \n An even longer rap sheet  \nPlainview, L.I.: Given the decade-long series of child murders that New York City\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services has repeatedly failed to prevent \u2014 including Nixzmary Brown, Elisa Izquierdo, Myls Dobson, Zymere Perkins, Jaden Jordan, Mikey Guzman and Zamair Coombs \u2014 I feel compelled to unofficially re-name ACS with the following: Asses Committing Serial-killings. Sure, the physical murders were actually \u201cadministered\u201d by these children\u2019s monstrous mothers, fathers and mothers\u2019 boyfriends, but they were all virtually enabled by a series of ACS commissioners and workers, (not to mention mayors who also bear much bucks-stop-here responsibility). If every one of these murders had in fact been committed by an actual serial killer, could we ever punish him enough? But none of the many ACS employees who played any (negligent but not negligible) role in any of these deaths have shared in the immense suffering of these young victims in the hours, days, weeks, months or years leading up to their deaths. Mayor de Blasio should be ashamed and angry enough to finally put an end to cases like these that do not have to continue happening. Richard Siegelman \n Repairs needed now  \nManhattan: City Council Public Housing Committee Chairman Ritchie Torres is right in his demand for a larger upfront capital commitment from the city for NYCHA developments (\u201cMayor de Blasio\u2019s pledge to allocate $1 billion over 10 Years to replace roofs at NYCHA,\u201d Jan. 24\u201d). NYCHA residents cannot wait another 10 years for roofs to be fixed. Leaky roofs lead to mold, exacerbate chronic illnesses such as asthma and cause damage to building structures. The city needs to invest $1 billion upfront now so that NYCHA can make the necessary repairs that it has been forced to defer for years. It is time for the city to protect the health and safety of its residents, more than 600,000 New Yorkers. In our new reality, New York City cannot wait for federal dollars to make these major improvements, we must preserve this essential affordable housing now. Lucy Newman, The Legal Aid Society \n Calling out a thief  \nYonkers: To the person who found and kept my cellphone: Thanks for nothing. I dropped my Samsung phone in front of a small restaurant in the Bronx on Jan. 17 or 18 of this year and you had a chance to show me that there are still decent, honest people out there. Instead, when I called that night and spoke with you, you immediately asked for a reward. While I spoke to you, I used my computer to track it to Harlem near W. 129th St. You seemed to agree on returning it but requested that I call you back the next day. I called the phone the rest of week and you never responded again. I\u2019m still paying for that phone. Instead of showing me an honest person, you elected to turn thief. If I had found someone else\u2019s phone, I would\u2019ve gone out of my way to return it \u2014 without requiring a reward. But I guess that\u2019s the difference between you and me. Francisco Matos \n Freedom to march and work  \nHuntington Station, L.I.: One of the more distasteful things shouted at my 85-year-old mother as she sat in a lawn chair, holding an anti-war sign with other members of her Catholic pacifist group, was \u201cGet a job!\u201d It is time for people on all degrees of the political arc to stop accusing those who take the time to stand up for their beliefs of goofing off. I know folks from the hard right to the far left and all of us under 70 are working and paying taxes. People don\u2019t always work 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. With flex time, tele-commuting, etc., we have much more freedom to protest than we used to. Please find some truth-based insults to fling. Ann Rita Darcy \n Double Don  \nWilliamsburg, Va.: President Trump is the reincarnation of both George Patton and Douglas MacArthur \u2014 all blood and guts and someone who knows how to manipulate the press. Trump should keep up the pressure on all his opponents and keep them guessing as to his next move. He is showing significant strength and Vladimir Putin has to be in awe. It will certainly strengthen America\u2019s hand when it comes time to negotiate with Russia. John Lemandri \n No more neo-cons, please  \nNew Rochelle, N.Y.: Cloaked with humanitarian largesse, Charles Krauthammer continues to push the ultra hawkish neo-conservative ideas that are the prime factors for American recession and chaotic global instability (\u201cUnder Trump, America recedes,\u201d Jan. 27). Acting as world policeman with vast military involvement is no longer sustainable and was never wise. Foreign entanglements have detrimentally impacted our middle class economically, as well as with a very serious problem with PTSD and a failed Veterans Administration. Can we please put the neo-conservative agenda where it always belonged \u2014 in the dustbin of history, and move on with President Trump\u2019s vision of American exceptionalism rather than global mediocrity? Patrick O\u2019Connor \n Wall payments  \nStaten Island: I can tell you exactly who\u2019s going to pay for the wall \u2014 the American consumer! The U.S. will put fees and tariffs on goods from Mexico, and those will be passed along to the consumer. Marion Hodgman \n Importing taxes  \nHicksville, L.I.: So Don the Con is having trouble getting Mexico to pay for the wall and his answer is to try imposing a 20% tax on Mexican imports. This, of course, means that the American public will be paying for the wall twice \u2014 once in taxes and again when the purchased goods arrive from Mexico because, as conservatives love to remind us, corporations don\u2019t really pay taxes; they merely pass them through to their customers. Joe Squerciati \n Bad friend  \nQueens Village: After one week in office, Trump managed to tick off Mexico and sour relationships. I wonder what will happen after the visit from England\u2019s prime minister? Gloria L. Catalanotto \n Stay out of jail for free  \nManhattan: So what I got out of the mayor\u2019s speech was if you\u2019re an illegal alien who committed a crime or crimes, come to New York (\u201cMayor de Blasio vows to fight Trump\u2019s anti-immigration order threatening to pull funding for \u2019sanctuary cities\u2019 like NYC,\u201d Jan. 25).

She had to wear a uniform in Mexico, and said it\u2019s a little overwhelming to have to decide what to wear each day.\n\nAlbanian student Rei Braja said there are more class options than he\u2019s used to. When he arrived at Kokomo, he didn\u2019t realize there were multiple chemistry and math classes, and he was confused by his class schedule at first.\n\nNguyen Tran, a student from Vietnam, said his school back home had a designated time for naps during the day. It\u2019s one thing he misses, he said, but he doesn\u2019t plan to go back. He hopes to graduate from Kokomo and go to college in the U.S.\n\nThe availability of physical education and sports is another big difference for many of the students. Valdir Anghinoni, a student from Brazil, said his school doesn\u2019t offer sports. When he came to Kokomo, he decided to try out for the football team. He remembers the coach telling the group of high school students to watch one of the returning players. Within five minutes, that player had broken his arm. Anghinoni said he immediately grabbed his things and walked home. Football, it turned out, was not for him.\n\nThat story is one the students know well. Most of them live together in dorms downtown, cooking meals, playing games and socializing. Though most of them come from different countries, they are able to connect with and learn from each other. \u201cWe\u2019re more like family,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cWe get to see each other every day, and we have family bonds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to live in the dorms,\u201d Braja said. \u201cYou get more interaction. We go to movies, play soccer. That interaction is good.\u201d\n\nThe students in the dorms have host families they see over weekends and on holidays, but some students prefer to live with host families instead of the downtown dorms.\n\nTeresa White is a host mother for Samuel Sfeir, a student from Brazil. White said she wanted to host an international student because of the exposure it could give her son, Blake White, a sophomore at the high school. White said she wanted her son to experience and learn from another culture. She said Sfeir was a good match because he wanted to live with a host family rather than in a dorm, but there are some challenges. Sfeir is still learning English, and he has trouble with slang words. However, she enjoys watching her son learn some Portuguese from Sfeir.\n\nThe students and host families aren\u2019t just learning languages, they\u2019re learning about other cultures. Many of the students were amazed by how the U.S. celebrates holidays, such as Christmas.\n\nCortes said she was shocked by how many gifts her host family gave her for Christmas. When New Year\u2019s rolled around, someone told Cortes that it\u2019s traditional to kiss a stranger at midnight. Cortes said she was worried she might have to kiss someone, and she saw other people kissing, but she preferred to skip that particular custom.\n\nWhite said Sfeir put his shoes in the hallway on New Year\u2019s Eve because in Brazil parents will put candy in children\u2019s shoes overnight. Braja said only children receive gifts during the holidays in Albania, so he was surprised to get a gift at all this Christmas.\n\nAnghinoni was surprised by the amount of food people eat over the holidays, especially Thanksgiving. Even outside of the holidays, the students said there are several things the U.S. does differently when it comes to food. There are more pop choices at restaurants, for instance, and they said they particularly enjoy Chick-fil-A.\n\nThe students said they are grateful for the experience to attend school in Kokomo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to come here and learn a lot,\u201d Anghinoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard task to stay here one year, but I love it here.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAELE PEMBERTON"},"topics":[{"name":"Indianapolis news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"International students adjust to life in US","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202197572","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T21:22:58Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://journalgazette.net/assets/13605039/17504827.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Milwaukee news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Clair","zipCode":"62220","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Belleville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belleville News Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659187","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1944"},"name":"Belleville News Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bnd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202201249","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Clair","zipCode":"62220","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Belleville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belleville News Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659187","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1944"},"name":"Belleville News Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bnd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202201609","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 47 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202203097","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

While more severe, with full bans to all travel through or from these nations, Trump\u2019s list was half as long as Obama\u2019s. \n \nLebanon, Nigeria, Algeria, Afghanistan were some of the countries lucky to escape Trump\u2019s ban. \n \nWhile 15 of the 19 911 airplane hijackers were Saudi Arabian citizens, several  reports have criticized Trump  for excluding the kingdom which has severally been linked to  financing global terror including the 911 attack on US soil . \n \nWhile the US\u2019 actions under Obama and Trump may be viewed as extreme or Islamophobic, it is important to note that wealthy Gulf nations that could comfortably assimilate the entire population of refugees have imposed  similar bans on refugees from Syria  citing security and politico-cultural threats.

Those include potentially deploying additional advisers to Iraq and Syria, allowing U.S. military personnel to accompany local forces closer to the front lines, and delegating greater decision-making power to field commanders.\n\nCounseling Mr. Trump in the effort will be Stephen Bannon, the White House chief strategist whose influence inside the administration is expanding far beyond politics. \n\nIn an executive order, Mr. Trump reorganized the National Security Council to, along with other changes, give Mr. Bannon a regular seat on the principals committee \u2014 the meetings of the most senior national security officials, including the secretaries of defense and state.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order also states that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs will sit on the principals committee only when the issues to be discussed pertain to their \u201cresponsibilities and expertise.\u201d In the previous two administrations, both were included as regular attendees.\n\nThe White House thinks the changes will make the NSC more adaptive to modern threats.\n\nThe changes affirm the ascent of Mr. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative website that is popular with white nationalists, who has emerged as Mr. Trump\u2019s political consigliere.\n\nMr. Bannon has already been playing a major role in directing Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, administration officials say, and joined the president in the Oval Office on Saturday for his calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and several other leaders.\n\nBoat with tourists missing\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 A boat carrying 31 people, including around 20 Chinese tourists, is missing after sailing out from an eastern Malaysian city, Chinese state media said Sunday.\n\nThe Chinese Consulate General in Kota Kinabalu in the Malaysian state of Sabah said the boat lost contact after leaving Kota Kinabalu on Saturday morning, according to the official Xinhua News Agency said. \n\nIt was bound for Pulau Mengalum, an island about 60 kilometers (38 miles) west of the city.\n\nThe report cited the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency as saying there were 28 Chinese tourists on board. But the Chinese Consulate could only confirm the passport details of 18 Chinese citizens, Xinhua said.\n\nMalaysia deployed search and rescue ships and helicopters after receiving a call Saturday night about the boat\u2019s disappearance, Xinhua reported.\n\nCalls to the Chinese Consulate rang unanswered Sunday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"wire services"},"topics":[{"name":"Malaysia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"World briefs: Trump orders IS strategy, council changes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Allegheny","zipCode":"15222","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pittsburgh","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3543"},"name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.post-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202205448","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.post-gazette.com/libercus/default/graphics/PGFacebook_ICON_1500x1500.gif"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 47 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202206107","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

His book, \u201cThe Blood of Emmett Till,\u201d comes out next week.\n\n\u201cShe told me that \u2018Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Tyson, a Duke University research scholar whose previous books include \u201cBlood Done Sign My Name\u201d and \u201cRadio Free Dixie.\u201d\n\nEmmett Till was a 14-year-old black tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman, then known as Carolyn Bryant.\n\nHis murder became national news, was a galvanizing event in the civil rights movement and has been the subject of numerous books and movies.\n\nDuring the trial, Bryant said that he had grabbed her, and, in profane terms, bragged about his history with white women. The jury was not present when she testified.\n\nDonham\u2019s then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, were acquitted by the all-white jury. Both men, who later told Look magazine they did murder Till, have since died. Milam\u2019s widow, Juanita Milam, would later tell the FBI she believed that Carolyn Bryant had fabricated her story. Juanita Milam died in 2014. The Justice Department re-examined the case a decade ago, but no one was indicted as a murderer or an accomplice.\n\nOn Saturday, the maker of a documentary on Till said he had long been sure that Bryant\u2019s story was false.\n\n\u201cHis mother had mentioned that Emmett had a speech impediment and that the things Bryant claimed he was saying, he could not have said easily,\u201d said Keith Beauchamp, whose book \u201cThe Untold Story of Emmett Till\u201d was released in 2005.\n\nTyson said that he spoke with Donham after her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, contacted him. Bryant had read \u201cBlood Done Sign My Name,\u201d about a racist murder during the author\u2019s childhood in Oxford, North Carolina, and invited Tyson to meet with her and Donham.\n\nTyson said he and Donham had two conversations, both lasting 2 to 3 hours, and that he planned at the time to place the material in the archives at the University of North Carolina. Asked why he waited so long to publicize his findings, he responded that historians think in different terms than do journalists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in what speaks to the ages than in what is the latest media thing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that he wasn\u2019t sure whether Donham knew about the book. He said he had fallen out of touch with the family and that when he last spoke with Bryant, a few years ago, she said Donham was in poor health.\n\nTill was a fun-loving teenager from Chicago visiting the Mississippi Delta and helping out on his great-uncle Mose Wright\u2019s farm.\n\nOn Aug. 24, 1955, Till and some other kids drove to a local store, Bryant\u2019s, for refreshments. At Bryant\u2019s, some of the kids stayed on the porch, watching a game of checkers, while the others filed inside to buy bubble gum and sodas. Carolyn Bryant, the 21-year-old wife of proprietor Roy Bryant, was behind the counter. Mrs. Bryant claimed Emmett bragged about dating white women up north. She said he grabbed her and asked her, \u201cHow about a date, baby?\u201d Simeon Wright, his cousin, heard none of this. But there is no doubt about what he heard when they left the store, he told the AP in 2005.\n\nStanding on the front porch, Emmett let out a wolf whistle.\n\nCarolyn Donham\u2019s whereabouts have long been a mystery, but North Carolina voter rolls list a Carolyn Holloway Donham. Holloway is her maiden name.\n\nThe address is for a green, split-level home in Raleigh at the mouth of a neat cul-de-sac just two turns off a busy four-lane thoroughfare. The well-tended house has burnt-orange shutters and a front-facing brick chimney decorated with a large metal sunburst. Orange flags emblazoned with the word \u201cGoogle\u201d dot the lawn.\n\nA woman, who appeared to be of late middle age, and a small barking dog appeared at the front door. When a reporter asked if this was the Bryant family home, the woman replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Carolyn Donham was at home, the woman replied, \u201cShe\u2019s not available.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HILLEL ITALIE"},"topics":[],"title":"Till accuser tells author she lied","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202206892","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:10:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://journalgazette.net/assets/13605175/17527768.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

When focusing their learning on what has gone before, how do we know that we are teaching them the right things for what comes next?\" \n \nThe focus, according to Mr Caller, may be better applied to a child's individual talents and skills, using creativity and adapting to advancements in technology and new information as they happen. \n \nMr Caller said: \"In private tutoring, we see time after time how focusing on a child's individual interests and talents, and adapting teaching styles and lesson planning to compliment them, results in a child who is more interested and eager to learn. Tutors International is now seeing clients who are already starting to look for 'outside the box' thinkers when selecting their private tutors [2]. They want someone who can expose their child to a wide range of topics, concepts and ideas from an early age, and use new advancements in technology to their learning advantage. They want someone who can 'move with the times', and this paves the way for some very exciting job opportunities for forward thinking tutors, worldwide.\" \n \nWith a career in education spanning over 25 years, Mr Caller believes that embracing these latest developments and incorporating them into a child's own individual curriculum, while prioritising their creativity and nurturing a natural curiosity, is key in shaping adults that can use their own skills to adapt and succeed in a world that their teachers may never get to experience. \n \nTutors International places exceptional tutors with families based on their individual needs and circumstances.

Excluded are several majority-Muslim nations where the Trump Organization is active and which in some cases have faced issues with terrorism.\n\nThe restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the United States without a visa because of concerns over terrorism. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering some more powerful and wealthy majority Muslim allies, such as Egypt.\n\nBut without divesting from his company, as bipartisan ethics experts had advised, Mr. Trump is now facing questions about whether he designed the new rules with his own business at least partly in mind.\n\n\u201cHe needs to sell his businesses outside his family and place the assets in a blind trust, otherwise every decision he makes people are going to question if he\u2019s making the decision in the interests of the American people or his own bottom line,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. The group filed a lawsuit arguing Mr. Trump is violating a constitutional provision barring federal officials from accepting payments from foreign officials.\n\nEarlier this week, Norm Eisen, the group\u2019s chairman and an ethics adviser to Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cWARNING: Mr. Pres. your Muslim ban excludes countries where you have business interests. That is a CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION. See u in court.\u201d\n\nStephanie Grisham, a White House spokeswoman, said, \u201cThe high-risk territories are based on Congressional statute and nothing else.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said he has handed management of his business to his sons to avoid the perception that he is making presidential decisions to boost his own business. But he has retained ownership of the company, meaning if it thrives, he will personally profit.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order makes no mention of Turkey, which has faced several terrorist attacks in recent months. On Wednesday, the State Department updated a travel warning for Americans visiting Turkey.\n\nMr. Trump has licensed his name to two luxury towers in Istanbul. A Turkish company manufactures a line of Trump-branded home furnishings. Mr. Trump\u2019s most recent financial disclosure, filed in May, showed that he had earned as much as $6 million in the previous year from the deals.\n\n\u201cI have a little conflict of interest \u2018cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d he said in a December 2015 interview with Breitbart News. More recently, he has insisted that he has no conflicts because laws making conflicts illegal do not apply to the president.\n\nAlso untouched by Friday\u2019s executive order is the United Arab Emirates, a powerful Muslim ally with whom the United States has complicated relations. Mr. Trump has licensed his name to a Dubai golf resort, as well as a luxury home development and spa.\n\nMr. Trump has seemed disinclined to divorce himself of interests in the project. Its developer, Hussain Sajwani, recently attended a party at Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida estate, where a video showed Mr. Trump singling him out for praise.\n\nMr. Trump returned to the topic of his Dubai partnership this month at a news conference intended to show how he was separating from his business.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East - Hussein, Damac, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai - a number of deals, and I turned it down,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nHis point was that he was turning aside new projects that could raise ethical questions. An attorney for the company announced at the same event that the Trump Organization will embark on no new foreign deals while Mr. Trump is in office.\n\nThe executive order makes no mention of Saudi Arabia, home of 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in the 9/\u200b11 attacks. The Trump Organization had incorporated several limited liability companies in preparation for an attempt to build a hotel in Saudi Arabia, showing an interest in expansion there.

Then came a dispute about condoms, followed by papal concerns about Freemasons. Now it has become a full-scale proxy war between Pope Francis and the Vatican traditionalists who oppose him.\n\nFor months, an ugly, if quiet, spat over staffing simmered behind the walls of the Knights of Malta, the medieval Roman Catholic order, before spilling to the Vatican, setting off a back-and-forth between the two camps. Pope Francis and his lieutenants sent angry letters. The Knights ignored them, claiming sovereignty.\n\nLast week, the dispute finally blew up. Fed up, Pope Francis took the extraordinary steps of demanding the resignation of the order\u2019s leader \u2014 a decision the Knights officially accepted Saturday \u2014 and announcing that a papal delegate would step in. Conservatives denounced what they called an illegal annexation and ideological purging by a power-obsessed pontiff, while liberal observers saw the whole episode as resulting from an act of subterfuge by the pope\u2019s most public critic within the Vatican hierarchy, U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke.\n\nA squabble had erupted into an unexpected shock to the church with ideological fault lines running to the top of the Vatican.\n\n\u201cThe Vatican is a thing built of tradition,\u201d said John Thavis, author of \u201cThe Vatican Diaries\u201d and a veteran church analyst, \u201cand once those traditional parts start feuding with each other, that is a dangerous sign.\u201d\n\nPope Francis remains one of the world\u2019s most popular figures, but the spat with the Knights is a small indicator of how the political tensions rippling across the globe are alive in the Vatican, too. Only a year ago, Pope Francis\u2019 calls to fight climate change and help migrants seemed to place him in the lead of a progressive global vanguard.\n\nNow, suddenly, he is more politically isolated. The election of President Donald Trump and the rise of far-right populists in Europe have ushered in an angrier era \u2014 and emboldened those traditionalists inside the Vatican who sense that the pope could be vulnerable.\n\nThe Knights of Malta is a bastion of Catholic tradition. The order was founded in the 11th century by Amalfian merchants to help Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, and later became a military force, defending the faith during the Crusades and eventually holding off the armies of the Ottoman Empire from its fortress in Malta. The group, now with a wealthy and aristocratic membership of elite Catholics who parade in ornate raiment, has more recently specialized in aiding refugees and the poor in more than 100 countries.\n\nUntil last week, the order was led by the conservative and elaborately titled His Most Eminent Highness the Prince and Grand Master of the Order of Malta, Matthew Festing of Britain, a former Sotheby\u2019s representative in Northumberland, England, who had taken a monastic oath.\n\nLong-building tensions between Mr. Festing and the order\u2019s Grand Chancellor Albrecht von Boeselager of Germany, whose father participated in a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, escalated in recent months amid accusations that Mr. Boeselager had knowingly overseen the distribution of condoms as head of the order\u2019s charitable arm. Into this volatile situation stepped Cardinal Burke.\n\nIn 2014, Pope Francis had demoted Cardinal Burke, a leader of the church\u2019s traditionalist movement, from his position on the Vatican\u2019s Supreme Court. The cardinal\u2019s supporters say Pope Francis did this because of Cardinal Burke\u2019s opposition to the pope\u2019s tentative opening to the possibility of allowing divorced Catholics to receive communion.\n\nCardinal Burke\u2019s exile was at least a cushy one, as the pope named him as the Knights\u2019 patron and liaison to the Vatican, where he would be out of the way.\n\nBut the soft-spoken cardinal has made his presence felt.\n\nDuring the summer, as tensions mounted inside the order, Michael Hichborn, the president of the Lepanto Institute, a conservative Catholic organization in Virginia, conducted what he called a \u201cshort investigation\u201d into the order\u2019s international aid arm, which Mr. Boeselager oversaw.\n\nMr. Hichborn said he discovered the aid organization was promoting the use of condoms and contraceptives in Africa and Myanmar, a violation of church rules.\n\nIn November, he sent a summary to Cardinal Burke\u2019s office. Mr. Hichborn said he was thanked for the information and told that the cardinal \u201cwould be working on something regarding it.\u201d\n\nA few days later, Cardinal Burke relayed his concerns about Mr. Boeselager to Pope Francis. According to supporters of the cardinal, the pope then instructed him to root out from the order elements of Freemasonry, Vatican shorthand for adherents of a secular moral view. But other people familiar with the events inside the order said the pope had also urged Cardinal Burke and the order\u2019s leadership to settle the dispute through dialogue.\n\nInstead, Mr. Festing and Cardinal Burke met Mr. Boeselager at the order\u2019s headquarters on Dec. 6 and requested his resignation, claiming, Mr. Boeselager said in a statement, \u201cthat this was in accordance with the wishes of the Holy See.\u201d\n\nMr. Boeselager denied knowing about the condom distribution program and considered the move a coup and an attempt to tarnish him as a \u201cliberal Catholic.\u201d He argued that once he had discovered the program, he had informed the Vatican and it ended.\n\nHe also refused to leave, setting off a disciplinary procedure that led to his suspension, and reached out to the Vatican for confirmation that the pope desired his removal. Mr. Boeselager declined to comment for this article.\n\nPope Francis was apparently not pleased about the firing and did not want the dispute to spill into the public, which it did when The Tablet, a Catholic publication in England, broke the news of the grand chancellor\u2019s firing.\n\nThe pope was already critical of the ornate dress favored by the Knights and by Cardinal Burke. Pope Francis also had a history of run-ins with the Knights during his time as a cardinal in Argentina.\n\nSo on Dec. 21, Pope Francis wrote directly to Mr. Festing, conveying his decisions on what he called the \u201cpainful circumstances\u201d and making clear that those decisions had \u201cvalue, regardless of anything else to the contrary.\u201d Attached to his letter were more letters from his second-highest-ranking official, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, stating that \u201cHis Holiness asked for dialogue as the way to confront and resolve eventual problems\u201d and that \u201che never spoke, instead, of kicking someone out!\u201d\n\nThe Vatican secretary of state also wrote that the firing \u201cnot be attributed to the will of the pope.\u201d Critically, he noted that the Knights, because of the group\u2019s status as a lay religious order, fell under the pope\u2019s authority, and that the pope had formed a commission to investigate the firing of Mr. Boeselager. But Mr. Festing refused to comply with the papal commission, citing the order\u2019s status as a sovereign entity and raising questions about the integrity of a commission full of Mr. Boeselager\u2019s allies.\n\n\u201cI think maybe he was getting bad advice\u201d from Cardinal Burke, said one senior Vatican official, who requested anonymity. (Cardinal Burke and Mr. Festing declined to comment.)\n\nOthers say Mr. Festing hardly needed to be egged on by Cardinal Burke, and note that despite having no territory, the order is sovereign, issuing its own passports and stamps and conducting diplomatic missions.\n\nOn Jan. 17, the Vatican issued an unusually tough statement supporting the commission and rejecting \u201cany attempt to discredit these members of the group and their work.\u201d The commission ultimately ruled that the pope did have authority over the Knights of Malta.\n\nOn Tuesday, he exercised it. He called Mr. Festing to the Vatican and asked for him to step down, a move the Vatican announced the next day. The order followed with its own statement, saying Mr. Festing\u2019s resignation would become official once the order\u2019s counselors met on Via dei Condotti to formally accept it. On Saturday, they did just that, reinstating Mr. Boeselager and promising to collaborate with the pope\u2019s delegate.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jason Horowitz / The New York Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Malta news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Ten centuries later, a pope and knights do battle","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Allegheny","zipCode":"15222","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pittsburgh","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3543"},"name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.post-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202212173","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:37:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2017/01/29/720x_q90_cMC_z_ca0,11,4200,2804/POPE-KNIGHTS-SQUABBLE.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The official said Mr. Putin brought up several times that Islamic terrorism was a \u201ccommon foe\u201d for the U.S. and Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose details of the call and insisted on anonymity.\n\nContrary to statements from the White House, the Kremlin said that the two leaders addressed the importance of \u201crestoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin also said Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump spoke in particular about international issues, including the fight against terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the situation on the Korean peninsula and the Ukraine crisis.\n\nMoscow has applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to rebuild U.S.-Russian relations, which have been pushed to their worst level since the Cold War by the Ukraine crisis, war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in U.S. elections. Mr. Trump signed a presidential memorandum on the plan to defeat the IS on Saturday, including in it the possibility of teaming up with \u201cnew coalition partners,\u201d suggesting that pairing up with Russia on counterterrorism issues isn\u2019t off the table. Mr. Trump was noncommittal about whether he was considering lifting the economic sanctions ahead of the call.\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine, drawing condemnation in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn response, sanctions were implemented against sectors of Russia\u2019s economy, including financial services, energy, mining and defense. The Obama administration also sanctioned people in Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle.\n\nPresident Barack Obama also ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds in the United States and expelled 35 diplomats that he said were really spies. These sanctions followed an assessment by U.S. intelligence that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump become president.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tempered approach to U.S.-Russia relations has already raised concern among several European allies who believe keeping Russia in check is essential to regional security.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, whose country \u2014 as part of the European Union \u2014 also has punished Russia for its provocations in Ukraine, voiced the view of many in Europe, telling reporters in Washington on Friday: \u201cWe believe the sanctions should continue.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence and other senior advisers joined Mr. Trump for the call with Mr. Putin, including his national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior strategist Steve Bannon. Mr. Trump also spoke on Saturday with the leaders of Japan, Germany, France and Australia.\n\nTwo Republican senators \u2014 Arizona\u2019s John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Ohio\u2019s Rob Portman, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 warned the White House about easing any punishments on Moscow and they pledged to turn the sanctions into law. Mr. Portman said lifting sanctions \u201cfor any reason other than a change in the behavior that led to those sanctions in the first place would send a dangerous message to a world already questioning the value of American leadership and the credibility of our commitments after eight years of Obama administration policies.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain has emerged as a frequent critic of Mr. Trump among Capitol Hill Republicans. He takes a dim view of trying to reset relations with Moscow and says Mr. Trump should remember that Mr. Putin is \u201ca murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain and Mr. Portman are part of a bipartisan group of senators who have introduced legislation designed to demonstrate to Mr. Trump that forcefully responding to Moscow\u2019s meddling isn\u2019t a partisan issue.\n\nThe bill would impose mandatory visa bans and freeze the financial assets of anyone who carries out cyberattacks against public or private computer systems and democratic institutions. The legislation also mandates sanctions in Russia\u2019s all-important energy sector and on investments in the development of civil nuclear projects to rebuke Moscow for its provocations in eastern Ukraine and military support for Syrian President Bashar Assad.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Julie Pace and Vivian Salama /"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump, Putin discuss 'mutually beneficial' trade, security","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Allegheny","zipCode":"15222","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pittsburgh","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3543"},"name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.post-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202212478","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:35:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2017/01/29/720x_q90_cMC_z_ca0,0,5472,3648/NatWorld012921-9.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But the run-up to those negotiations \u2014 further complicated by a Supreme Court ruling that Ms. May needs Parliament\u2019s approval to begin the process \u2014 has created enormous uncertainties. They include how European Union citizens residing in Britain \u2014 and the British citizens residing in other European Union countries \u2014 will work and live if they cannot freely traverse borders as they do now.\n\nBig banks and other multinational companies with operations in London and elsewhere in Britain are not awaiting the outcome of the negotiations, expected to last two years, that will determine the scope of the country\u2019s changed status. They are making contingency plans to move thousands of jobs elsewhere. Other European Union members are eager to get those jobs. Their leaders also have suggested that Britain must be penalized economically to discourage further defections from the bloc.\n\nBritain\u2019s decision also threatens to alter its geography and possibly stoke political instability. Scotland and Northern Ireland had wanted to stay within the European Union and may now move to leave Britain. A new referendum on Scottish independence \u2014 reprising a measure that was defeated in 2014 \u2014 is considered likely. Unrest in Northern Ireland could resume if the border with Ireland, a European Union member, is restricted.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Union\u2019s negotiator for Britain\u2019s exit, wrote in The Guardian on Jan. 18 that \u201cBrexit will be a sad, surreal and exhausting process.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Will Turkey turn away from Europe?\n\nTurkey has been negotiating to become a European Union member for more than a decade, but that prospect has turned more doubtful, partly because of the authoritarian actions of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, particularly since a failed coup attempt in July.\n\nIncreasingly exasperated with the European Union, Mr. Erdogan has suggested that he may hold a referendum in Turkey this year on whether to withdraw its membership application. Mr. Erdogan has also suggested that he may seek to restore the death penalty in Turkey, a step other European leaders say would disqualify the country from joining the European Union.\n\nNonetheless, European officials are loath to suspend the negotiations for fear that Mr. Erdogan will scrap an agreement to restrict the flow of migrants and refugees from Turkey into Europe, an exodus that has placed extraordinary strains on the Continent and helped incite nationalist and populist anger.\n\n\u2014 Can Greece find relief?\n\nThe country that came to symbolize Europe\u2019s economic travails a few years ago has receded from the headlines somewhat, obscured by Brexit, fears of terrorist attacks in European cities and coming elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. But Greece\u2019s economy remains anemic and in need of more debt relief.\n\nDespite three bailouts in five years, poverty rates are increasing and the unemployment rate is Europe\u2019s highest. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of the leftist Syriza Party, who rose to power in 2015 on his defiance of Greece\u2019s creditors and threat to leave the European Union\u2019s single-currency zone, is sagging in the polls, raising the possibility of political turbulence and new elections.\n\nNegotiations for further restructuring of Greece\u2019s debts, involving Germany and the International Monetary Fund, also have encountered difficulties. \n\n\u2014 Can Italy\u2019s banks stay afloat?\n\nThe chronically troubled economy of Italy, the European Union\u2019s fourth-largest, has aroused growing concern as possibly the next Greek-style debt crisis. The main reason is the weakness of Italy\u2019s big banks, which are carrying hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bad loans. They are reluctant to lend more money, which is precisely what Italy needs to stimulate its economy.\n\nItaly\u2019s debt levels also have irked Germany, Europe\u2019s strongest economy, where leaders are reluctant to help finance any bailout.\n\n\u2014 Will the United States stand with Europe?\n\nThe European Union and United States have closely coordinated their regimen of economic sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014, a response to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and military actions in eastern Ukraine. But Mr. Trump has injected uncertainty into Europe over a unified stand toward Russia, suggesting he wants to ease or terminate the sanctions. Mr. Trump, whose amity toward Russia is a political issue in the United States, also has criticized NATO, asserting that the alliance is obsolete \u2014 a description Russian officials have welcomed.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s subordinates have sought to reassure European Union leaders that the United States remains a reliable ally, doubts have been planted. \n\n\u2014 Will nationalists triumph elsewhere?\n\nEmboldened by the momentum of Brexit and Mr. Trump, nationalist politicians espousing hostility toward the European Union and Muslim immigrants have made strong gains in campaigns for coming elections in three European countries, including the two largest.\n\nIn the Netherlands, where a national vote is set for March 15, populist lawmaker Geert Wilders, who wants to slash immigration and follow Britain out of the European Union, is doing well in the polls.\n\nIn France, where presidential elections are set for April 23 with a runoff between the two top candidates May 7, the rise of the extreme right has been a dominant theme. Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front, has said she hopes to replicate Trump\u2019s success. She supports a referendum on European Union membership and new border controls.\n\nGermany holds federal elections Sept. 24, which will determine the future of Chancellor Angela Merkel. But her positions on European unity, open borders and generosity toward refugees have seriously weakened her popularity. Mr. Trump mocked and insulted her during his campaign, describing his Democratic adversary, Hillary Clinton, as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Merkel,\u201d and called the German leader\u2019s refugee policy \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Germany\u2019s biggest political story is the rapid ascent of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has evoked memories of the Nazis as it campaigns on denunciations of Ms. Merkel, the euro, immigration and Islam.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rick Gladstone / The New York Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Greece news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Questions that could reshape a worried Europe","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Allegheny","zipCode":"15222","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pittsburgh","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3543"},"name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.post-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202212684","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:39:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.post-gazette.com/libercus/default/graphics/PGFacebook_ICON_1500x1500.gif"}],"video":[]}}

But for us to do that, we need everyone to be safe and secure,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted him as saying. \n \nPakistan have not hosted any international cricket tournaments since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009,when six Pakistani Policemen were killed and some of the visiting players were injured. \n \nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was in talks with the MCC at the time for the latter to send a cricket team to Lahore, but the terror attack put an end to that. \n \n\"We don't want to get it wrong,\" Clarke said. \"We all know one terrible incident can push things backwards again. What happened here in one of Lahore's parks did make it impossible for us to send a team here last year. So we're hoping to move forward, but this isn't an easy road.\" \n \nThe ICC official further said that there's a considerable amount of perception that needs to be changed and information that needs to be shared. \n \n\"But I am most impressed by the efforts of the authorities to make Lahore a safe city,\" he asserted. \n \nThe Federation of International Cricketers Associations (FICA) has earlier this month advised players not to tour Pakistan due to an extremely elevated state of insecurity in the country. \n \nThe cricket federation, citing unnamed security consultants, had termed Pakistan as an unsafe place to play cricket. \n \nHowever, Clarke didn't comment on that statement, saying he hadn't discussed that statement with FICA, or read it in full. \n \n\"I was far more interested in coming here for myself before I opened that conversation,\" he said. \n \nThe West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) had also this month rejected the proposed tour to Pakistan after the security concerns raised by FICA.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 48 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kansas City Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1100"},"name":"Kansas City Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmbc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202233614","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year.\n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market.\n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds.\n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period.\n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent.\n\nBonds are for fear\n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel.\n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again.\n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them.

But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line.

That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Milwaukee news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202253953","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She did this live on Facebook. We'll likely never know why she chose to do it that way. Perhaps she felt invisible. Perhaps she wanted to be seen. \n\nHer self-destruction drew attention, all right, but surely not the kind she wanted. To read the report by The Miami Herald's Carol Marbin Miller and Alex Harris is to cringe with disgust: \n\n\"A thousand people watched for nearly an hour as Naika Venant prepared to kill herself. They kept watching for another hour as the 14-year-old dangled on her scarf from the shower door in the bathroom of her Miami Gardens foster home. \n\n\"People mocked the young girl, called her names and reacted to the video with Facebook's laughing emoji, said Antonio Gethers, one of her 4,500 Facebook friends. Others posted cruel parody videos pretending to hang themselves, too.\" \n\nThe bleak despair and dead-end hope that cause people to take their lives is, unfortunately, all too familiar. And those feelings can be magnified dangerously in adolescence, an age where all emotions are outsized, all passions urgent and raw. Factor in that she was a survivor of physical abuse and sexual assault, and it becomes depressingly easy to imagine the forces that drove Naika to destroy herself. \n\nIt is less easy to understand why that act was received the way it was. \n\nThe harsh laughter and cold ridicule of \"people\" - the word is used advisedly - who watched Naika's suicide suggest that we flatter ourselves when we call ourselves a higher species. Apparently, only one individual tried to help; a friend saw the live feed and called police, but inadvertently sent them to the wrong address. By the time it got sorted out, Naika was beyond saving. \n\nMiami-Dade schools chief Alberto Carvalho blames Facebook for what happened, which is as understandable as it is misguided. Might as well blame the sidewalk where Kitty Genovese was killed in 1964 as she screamed for help that didn't come. Or the Golden Gate Bridge, where a 2006 documentary, \"The Bridge,\" shows passersby passing by without intervening as people climb up on the ledge, preparing to jump. Or the walkway behind a Salem, New Jersey, McDonald's where a young mother was brutally beaten in 2014 while observers laughed and recorded it on their cellphones. \n\nFacebook is an easy target, but it is not the web service whose behavior is appalling here. It is, rather, the ordinary people, the everyday Janes and Joes who could have acted to save this child, but did not. One is mindful of what's called \"the bystander effect,\" which, according to Psychology Today, \"occurs when the presence of others hinders an individual from intervening in an emergency situation.\" \n\nBut that doesn't explain the laughter. It does not make sense of the mocking derision of a troubled child. \n\nNo, that behavior speaks to moral stupidity, to the objectification of other people and their pain, to a selfish inability to extend compassion beyond the barricades of one's own life. All of which have come to feel far too commonplace. It cries out for families, worship houses and schools to rededicate themselves to teaching what it means to be a truly human being. That would be a good way to give meaning to this tragedy. \n\nIt's haunting to think Naika might have killed herself on Facebook hoping to be seen. \n\nYes, an audience watched her die. Then they clicked their browsers to see what else was on. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nLeonard Pitts Jr., winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary, is a columnist for the Miami Herald, 3511 N.W. 91 Avenue, Doral, Fla. 33172.

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202256642","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

From another angle, it's a man - so far, always a man - sitting behind a desk as the world's knottiest problems play on his quirks and insecurities. \n\nSeldom has the dual nature of the office been more on display than in the first week of the presidency of Donald John Trump. \n\nAll week, the White House rolled out executive orders and presidential memorandums, most of which were strikingly normal - a word Trump's opponents hate to hear applied to him. \n\nThe rhetoric may have been sweeping, the scheduling startlingly ad hoc and the pace unusually hectic. But few of the actions, with the major exception of the ban on refugees and restrictions on immigration announced Friday, would have surprised anyone had they been taken by other Republicans, from Jeb Bush to Ted Cruz. \n\nThen there was the rest of it - the displays of presidential id, unfiltered by retainers. \n\nIn speeches, interviews and off-the-cuff remarks, Trump obsessed about the size of his inauguration crowds, nakedly declared that he favors \"torture\" - dispensing with George W. Bush-style euphemisms about \"enhanced interrogation\" - and sought to explain away his loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by insisting on the falsehood that 3 million to 5 million illegal votes had been cast. \n\nRepublican elected officials spent the week trying to adjust to the new reality, hoping to focus attention on the normal parts, only to repeatedly be upstaged by an insistently non-normal president. \n\n\"This is going to be an unconventional presidency,\" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Thursday in Philadelphia, where Trump spoke at a GOP legislative retreat. \"That's something we're just all going to have to get used to.\" \n\nWhat voters ultimately will make of all this remains unknown, although Trump's early standing in polls has been consistently poor. For all the attention the first week of a presidency gets, it's \"seldom determinative,\" said veteran pollster Peter Hart. \n\nWhat is clear is that for the rest of Trump's tenure, the White House will provide the stage for an ego-driven drama not seen since at least the days of Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson - daunting historical precedents for the new 45th president. \n\nTrump is \"conventional in that he wants approval. People in politics seek admiration,\" said historian Robert Dallek, a biographer of Johnson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and other presidents. \n\n\"In that sense he's a very conventional politician, but he does this in a very exaggerated way,\" Dallek said. There's \"a personality flaw in the man,\" he added. \"He just cannot abide criticism.\" \n\nThe problem for Trump, said Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution in Washington, who has advised presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower, is that \"the presidency is constantly surrounded by criticism.\" \n\n\"It's a tightrope that he's walking,\" Hess said. \"The question is when and if he really steps off the edge.\" \n\nSo far, nothing as dramatic as that has happened. But the uncensored side of Trump has interrupted his more sober side repeatedly through his first week, like an impish child running into a dining room to stick his tongue out at the adult guests. In the process, the president disrupted his own introduction of an unusually large number of policy initiatives. \n\nThe day after his inauguration, a rambling speech at the CIA in which he denounced the media for its reporting on the inaugural crowd count overshadowed Trump's initial executive orders. Monday went smoothly until evening, when in remarks to members of Congress at a reception, Trump veered into talking about illegal votes. Wednesday brought a televised interview with ABC's David Muir in which Trump returned to both themes. \n\n\"I had a tremendous victory, one of the great victories ever,\" he said, adding, \"They say I had the biggest crowd in the history of inaugural speeches.\" \n\nTrump's unconventional outbursts and the volume of major policy shifts deeply unsettled the sorts of voters who had opposed him all along, said Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University who studies the presidency. \n\nThe campaign had a \"postmodern element\" that led many people to \"assume that most of this was just rhetoric, and now they're surprised that it wasn't,\" she said. \"Some of the things that were written off as demagoguery that would go away, maybe won't.\" \n\nOn the flip side, many of Trump's supporters are clearly thrilled by what he's done so far, telling reporters about their renewed sense of optimism for the country. \n\nAs before, Trump's aides haven't worried much about winning over opponents, instead focusing relentlessly on the issues of most importance to the supporters he already has: jobs, trade, Obamacare and immigration. They've done so in ways that allowed for bold rhetoric but mostly undefined action, giving the new president maximum room to maneuver in the weeks and months to come. \n\nTrump's order on the Affordable Care Act, for example, which he issued within hours of taking the oath of office, opened the way for the administration to begin dismantling Obamacare if they choose to, but did not change anyone's coverage for now. \n\nWednesday's order directing the Department of Homeland Security to begin building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border did not commit to any particular type of barrier, or any specific amount of money. It directed the department to come up with a plan for \"operational control\" of the border. That could end up meaning a few dozen miles of new fencing or a few hundred, but most likely not a wall stretching the 2,000 miles from the Gulf Coast to the Pacific or new construction along the parts of the border that already have extensive fortification. \n\nSimilarly, a second order issued the same day on sanctuary cities allows the administration \"at its discretion\" to cut off an unspecified range of federal funds from certain cities that \"willfully refuse to comply\" with federal immigration law. That could sweep in a lot of localities or very few, depending on how big a confrontation the new president eventually decides he wants. \n\nThe exception so far - the one order that had major immediate consequences - was the temporary ban on granting entry visas to residents of seven majority-Muslim nations in the Mideast and North Africa, which stopped travelers at airports worldwide. That order, especially the favored status it provided to Christians and other non-Muslims, brought threats of lawsuits and outraged denunciations by Trump's opponents. \n\nThe lack of protest from all but a couple of congressional Republicans, however, reinforces what polling during the campaign season showed: Even a full ban on Muslim immigration, which would be more sweeping than Friday's order, has considerable support among Trump's voters. \n\nIn other areas, the administration has so far steered away from actions that would have carried big political risk. \n\nMost notably, Trump has not ended former President Barack Obama's program to exempt from deportation young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. \n\nThrough the week, the administration continued to accept applications for the program, known as DACA, for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly indicated that Trump has no immediate plans to act against the more than 740,000 so-called Dreamers who have the temporary right to live and work legally in the U.S. because of the program. \n\nTrump also has taken no steps yet to end U.S. involvement in international efforts to combat climate change or to renounce Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. And his aides sought to distance him from a draft executive order aimed at reviving CIA secret interrogation sites overseas. \n\nTrump, when asked Friday about his comments on torture, said at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, \"I happen to be believe it does work,\" but added that he would defer to his Defense secretary, retired Gen. James N. Mattis, who disagrees. \n\n\"He will override,\" Trump said - a startling degree of deference by a president to a Cabinet official. \n\nFor now, \"much of what (Trump's) doing at this stage is symbolic,\" said Hart, who conducted extensive focus groups with Trump supporters during the campaign year. \n\nUltimately, however, while aides in every modern presidency spend huge amounts of time getting the symbols right, \"performance trumps theatrics,\" Hart said. \n\nBecause of that, Trump has \"a longer leash than some expect,\" he said. \n\nTrump's actions in his first week in office may \"galvanize the opposition,\" Hart said, but \"the people who may be the swing voters won't be as quick to react, nor will they care as much about his outbursts or things that the establishment sees as unpresidential.\" \n\n\"My sense,\" Hart said, \"is that they've gotten used to Donald Trump.\" \n\n(Staff writer Noah Bierman of the Tribune Washington Bureau contributed to this report.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DAVID LAUTERTribune Washington Bureau"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Analysis: For Trump, a first week both normal and far from it","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202260046","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Beaufort","zipCode":"29910","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bluffton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Island Packet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1303"},"name":"Island Packet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.islandpacket.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202269725","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear.

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk City","zipCode":"23510","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Norfolk","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coshocton Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672982","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"85"},"name":"Coshocton Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coshoctontribune.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695202279101","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Gen. Xavier Becerra in his new job, it was an unheralded duty that Republican legislators wanted to pin him down on during recent confirmation hearings in Sacramento: the vetting of ballot initiatives. \n\nThe attorney general is tasked under California law to write a brief title and summary of each measure that will end up on the state ballot. \n \n\u201cWhat will you do to ensure that you\u2019re being descriptive and objective, and following the election code, when you write those ballot titles and summaries?\u201d asked Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham (R-Templeton). \n \nTo understand the question requires knowing a bit of California political history. Attorneys general have long had the duty to collect and then prepare proposed initiatives before the measure\u2019s backers can begin collecting voter signatures. \n \nBut in the era of big money initiative campaigns \u2014 generally viewed as the years following the landmark 1978 property tax rollback, Proposition 13 \u2014 critics have occasionally complained of partisan scheming, alleging that the title and summary of an initiative are sometimes crafted in a way that pleases the attorney general\u2019s political allies. \n\nPolitical Road Map: Californians have a love-hate relationship with initiatives » \n\nOpponents of Proposition 13 complained that former Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, a Republican, wrote a summary that didn\u2019t reveal the law made it harder to pass tax increases in the Legislature. Gov. Jerry Brown, in his time as attorney general, took fire over the ballot summary for the 2008 ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8 , and its emphasis on how the (now defunct) law would \u201celiminate\u201d the right of same-sex couples to marry . \n\nAdvocates of overhauling California\u2019s public employee pension system have balked more than once over initiative titles and summaries written by Democrats serving as attorney general. In 2005, a proposed reform was summarized as removing death and disability benefits. The most recent attorney general, now Sen. Kamala Harris, also came under fire for her summaries of efforts to change pension benefits for government workers . \n\nThe evidence is largely circumstantial. And judges have generally given pretty wide latitude to the attorney general, who\u2019s simply instructed in state election law to summarize \u201cthe chief purpose and points\u201d of an initiative. \n\nBut it\u2019s also a potential game changer. Strategists and pollsters often believe an initiative\u2019s title and summary is a prescient predictor of the campaign ahead. And some California voters make snap decisions on ballot measures based on those easily accessible nuggets of information. \n\nGiven that Democrats have held the office of attorney general for 18 years, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the loudest calls for change come from Republicans. But those efforts have been routinely rebuffed. \n\nIn 2015, legislation to impose new rules on the attorney general was quietly killed in the Assembly\u2019s appropriations committee. Earlier this month, newly elected Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-El Dorado Hills) decided to go one step further. His proposal would change the state\u2019s constitution and transfer the responsibility for initiative titles and summaries to the independent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, which currently writes a fiscal analysis of each measure. \n\nAs for Becerra, the Los Angeles Democrat told lawmakers in confirmation hearings this month that he believes in fairness when it comes to summarizing initiatives. \n\n\u201cI know many of you will be reading over my shoulders,\u201d he told assemblymembers on Jan. 10. \u201cAnd I understand the importance of a word.\u201d \n   \njohn.myers@latimes.com \n\nFollow  @johnmyers  on Twitter, sign up for our daily  Essential Politics newsletter  and listen to the weekly  California Politics Podcast \n\nALSO: \n\nCalifornia initiative campaigns rake in a record $473 million in 2016 \n\nPolitical Road Map: How unlimited cash gets funneled into legislative campaigns \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Myers"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Political Road Map: Some believe there's bias baked into the official descriptions of California initiatives","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91011","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"La Canada Flintridge","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lacanada Online News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169788181","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Lacanada Online News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Film"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lacanadaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-xavier-becerra-california-attorney-general-snap-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-road-map-propositions-20161113-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/family/same-sex-marriage/proposition-8-%28california-2010%29-EVHST0000250-topic.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/29/local/me-gaymarriage29","http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/07/news/la-ol-fighting-words-public-employee-pension-reform-20140107","http://www.twitter.com/johnmyers","http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-newsletter-essential-politics-signup-page-htmlstory.html","https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/california-politics-podcast/id1067429614?mt=2","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-november-proposition-money-20161107-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-roadmap-unlimited-money-legislature-elections-20161023-snap-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695202281759","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d2768/turbine/la-pol-ca-road-map-initiatives-title-summary-power-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

We can be our own little island.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a stance that will be tested as California doubles down on its climate policies even as Trump steps back from the battle against global warming. And despite the bravado displayed last week at a conference on climate change hosted by state government officials, there was pervasive anxiety about the future as well.  \n \n\"I'm worried,\" said a federal scientist at the exhibit who asked to withhold his name  because he feared retaliation. Fearful that the Trump administration would strip climate information from government websites, he said he asked his team to start downloading information so they could continue their work.    \n\nCalifornia has always charted its own course on cleaning up the air, clamping down on tailpipe emissions decades ago to fight smog in Los Angeles before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was even created in 1970. But the gap between Sacramento and Washington was growing into a chasm only a week after Trump took the oath of office.  \n \nThe president is greenlighting oil pipelines that were rejected by President Obama. He told car manufacturers that regulations are \u201cout of control,\u201d and Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, his nominee to lead the EPA, expressed doubts about the severity of climate change during his confirmation hearing. \n\nMeanwhile, California is moving to dramatically slash its greenhouse gas emissions, and Senate leader Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) recently floated the possibility of generating all of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind. Major utilities have proposed a $1-billion investment  in electrifying the transportation network, including more charging stations for cars. \n\nIt\u2019s created a sense of dissonance for Californians, who are hunkering down even as they keep a wary eye on what\u2019s happening on the opposite side of the country. \n\n\u201cYou turn on the TV at night, and you hear these terrible things that are happening,\u201d said Kip Lipper, who works on environmental legislation for the state Senate. \u201cI tell my daughter, it\u2019s good to be cognizant of that, but this is the best place to be, in California.\u201d \n \nCalifornia emits only 1% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, but the state has tried to transform itself into an international model for fighting global warming. While Trump talks about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, officials here continue seeking new partners for the state\u2019s own, more ambitious international agreement . \n\nGov. Jerry Brown , in his State of the State speech Tuesday, said California wouldn\u2019t step back from its agenda no matter what happens in Washington, a message repeatedly emphasized by top state leaders at the climate conference. \n\n\u201cThis is when you do your best work,\u201d said John Laird, secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about pulling back just to sink with everyone else who isn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d \n\nThe conference was planned before Trump won the presidency, but the results of the election created a charged atmosphere among the hundreds of scientists, government officials and advocates who showed up. Attendees talked about being  \u201cresolute in our values,\u201d or how there\u2019s a \u201cmajor threat before us,\u201d or how strong policies are needed \u201cnow more than ever.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater seriousness in the room,\u201d said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of Climate Resolve, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helped organize the two-day event. \n\nCalifornia\u2019s climate agenda remains controversial, and some business interests believe the state is putting itself at a competitive disadvantage by ramping up regulations. The state\u2019s premiere initiative \u2014 the cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to purchase permits to release greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere \u2014 is the target of an ongoing legal challenge . \n\nBut the week\u2019s events were also a reminder of how much further the state has moved past the national conversation about climate change. Debates revolve around how global warming should be addressed, not whether it should be, or whether it\u2019s even real at all.  \n \nThree consecutive state administrations have pushed the state\u2019s policies forward. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, approved the country\u2019s first rules for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed legislation setting an overall goal  for reducing emissions in the state. Last year Brown enacted another law setting a new, stiffer target. \n\nA broad network of organizations \u2014 environmentalists, energy entrepreneurs and developers of carbon offset projects \u2014 has sprouted and expanded around these policies. \n \nAs further evidence, the conference hosted by state officials wasn\u2019t even the only event in Sacramento last week dedicated to California\u2019s climate agenda. Another gathering across town drew visitors from as far away as Australia to discuss the future of the cap-and-trade program.  \n\nNo one there expected the state to change course.  \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole ecosystem built to reduce emissions,\u201d said Jon Costantino, an environmental policy advisor who previously worked at the California Air Resources Board. \u201cThere\u2019s investors, there\u2019s businesses, there\u2019s consultants.\u201d \n\nHe added, \u201cTo pull the rug out from under that would have a dramatic impact.\u201d \n   \nchris.megerian@latimes.com \n\nTwitter: @chrismegerian \n\nALSO \n\nFearing climate change databases may be threatened in Trump era, UCLA scientists work to protect them \n\nEarth sets heat record in 2016 \u2014 for the third year in a row \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Megerian"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"As the White House changes course on climate change, California stubbornly presses forward","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91011","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"La Canada Flintridge","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lacanada Online News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169788181","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Lacanada Online News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Film"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lacanadaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-trump-administration-orders-media-1485281190-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-pipelines-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-epa-pick-scott-pruitt-renews-climate-1484758778-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-1484938433-htmlstory.html#nt=outfit","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-renewable-1484864454-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-electric-vehicles-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-climate-20161127-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-sac-climate-brown-agreement-20151206-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/jerry-brown-PEPLT007547-topic.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-jerry-brown-state-of-the-state-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-climate-court-hearing-20170124-story.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/23/local/me-global23","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-arnold-schwarzenegger-jerry-brown-1475704818-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-jerry-brown-signs-climate-laws-20160908-snap-story.html","https://twitter.com/ChrisMegerian","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-climate-change-data-20170121-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hottest-year-2016-20170118-story.html","http://latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695202296257","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d361f/turbine/la-pol-ca-california-climate-resolve-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

Ia adalah wakil kepala Bidang Pengkajian dan Penelitian (BPP) TKP PPI Dunia. Stephani yang merupakan anggota PPI Australia ini sedang menempuh pendidikan master di bidang ecotourism dan secara khusus peneliti ekowisata Papua Barat. \n \nStephani didampingi oleh moderator Izzudin Arafah Irawan dari Bidang Lapangan TKP PPI Dunia yang merupakan seorang peneliti sosial budaya Kabupaten Sorong dan Raja Ampat. Notulen juga dari Bidang Lapangan yaitu Chalilah Syahharbanu seorang putri daerah asli dari Papua Barat. \n \nKajian ini menghimpun beberapa fakta menarik yang dapat memajukan Papua lewat kontribusi penelitian.  \n \nCeritakan sekilas tentang Forum Kajian Online ini? \n \nKajian online FTKP kali ini merupakan sesi perdana, yang pertama kalinya untuk TKP, maklum umurnya masih 1 bulan. Singkatnya kajian online itu sharing atau diskusi bersama mengenai topik-topik seputar Papua dan Papua Barat, pembicaranya bisa siapa saja dari PPI ataupun umum. Melalui sesi perdana kali ini, kami ingin emperkenalkan apa itu TKP, apa saja struktur bidang kerjanya dan juga apa sih kajian online itu. Kebetulan karena latar belakang saya lebih ke arah konservasi dan ekowisata, beberapa topik tentang pariwisata Papua Barat pada khususnya, juga akan dibahas hari ini. \n \nCeritakan sekilas tentang BPP ini? \n \nBPP merupakan salah satu bidang kerja dari TKP, yang mempunyai wilayah tugas pada pelajar Indonesia di seluruh dunia terutama yang memiliki ketertarikan seputar Papua. Misi bidang ini adalah menghasilkan karya nyata untuk Papua dan Indonesia. Karya nyata di sini dapat berupa bentuk karya tulis (artikel, paper penelitian) ataupun kegiatan di lapangan. \n \nApa kontribusi pemateri untuk Papua saat ini? \n \nKebetulan di tahun 2017 ini saya sedang mengerjakan projek riset untuk disertasi S2 dengan mengambil tema ekowisata di Papua Barat, lebih tepatnya tentang Raja Ampat. Salah satu alasan kenapa memilih riset topik tentang Indonesia dan bukan Australia (yang pastinya akan lebih mudah), harapannya untuk menghasilkan sedikit pengetahuan tambahan untuk akademisi dan publik Indonesia. Mohon dukungannya ya teman-teman. \n \nApa sih yang dimaksud dengan Ecotourism atau ekowisata itu? \n \nSejauh ini belum ada definisi yang diterima secara universal, tapi kurang lebih ekowisata bisa dikatakan sebagai suatu bentuk aktifitas wisata ke area yang masih terbilang alami yang dilakukan untuk meminimalisir dampak negatif dari pariwisata pada umumnya, konservasi lingkungan serta melestarikan kehidupan dan kesejahteraan masyarakat lokal setempat. \n \nCeritakan sekilas tentang penelitian ekowisata Papua Barat yang sedang dikerjakan saat ini? \n \nJudul penelitiannya sendiri adalah \u201cVisitor\u2019s Activity Participation and Satisfaction in Raja Ampat Ecotourism: An Application of Innovative Importance-Performance Analysis\u201d Kenapa memilih riset topik mengenai Raja Ampat di Papua Barat? Karena sejauh ini, walaupun Raja Ampat sudah terkenal di mata dunia internasional dan dalam negeri, masih sedikit (hampir tidak ada) penelitian yang mengambil tema tentang pariwisata, kebanyakan lebih membahas tentang scientific data dan keanekaragaman hayati, mengingat lokasinya yang berada di pusat Coral Triangle. \n  \nKenapa memilih riset topik mengenai Raja Ampat di Papua Barat? \n \nKarena sejauh ini, walaupun Raja Ampat sudah terkenal di mata dunia internasional dan dalam negeri, masih sedikit (hampir tidak ada) penelitian yang mengambil tema tentang pariwisata, kebanyakan lebih membahas tentang scientific data dan keanekaragaman hayati, mengingat lokasinya yang berada di pusat Coral Triangle. \n  \nKendala-kendala apa saja yang menghambat perkembangan pariwisata di Papua Barat? \n \nYang pasti akses transportasi dan informasi, selain itu juga mungkin dalam hal keterbatasan dukungan dari pemerintah dan masyarakat setempat. Keterbatasan tingkat pendidikan juga seringkali menjadi hambatan, karena banyak anak muda yang memilih bekerja daripada bersekolah (tuntutan ekonomi). Kemampuan berbahasa asing menjadi salah satu kunci perkembangan pariwisata, ini juga alasan mengapa banyak turis internasional lebih memilih untuk berwisata ke Bali. Adat istiadat yang berbeda di tiap daerah, bisa dibilang menjadi tantangan (bukan hambatan), seperti hak ulayat/tanah adat misalnya. Untuk Raja Ampat spesifik, upaya pemda setempat sangat positif. Sudah banyak perubahan yang terlihat selama 10 tahun belakangan, dari mulainya transparasi penyaluran dana Entry Fee baru-baru ini dan juga peran aktif masyarakat lokal sendiri (Homestay Association). \n \nBagaimana kita dapat membantu perkembangan Papua Barat atau Papua, baik dalam hal pariwisata ataupun secara umum? \n \nCara paling mudah adalah dengan mencoba mencari tahu dan menambah pengetahuan pribadi terlebih dahulu tentang Papua Barat/Papua, dari berbagai sumber dan juga dengan berdiskusi langsung dengan teman-teman asli Papua atau memiliki pengalaman langsung di masyarakat papua. Dengan modal pengetahuan ini, harapannya akan tumbuh rasa pengertian dan apresiasi mendalam tentang Papua sendiri dan dari situ kita bisa membantu mempromosikan berbagai hal tentang Papua, mulai dari pariwisata, prestasi anak muda Papua, organisasi-organisasi profit maupun non profit yang membantu nyata di lapangan. Istilahnya kita perlu menjadi good ambassador terlebih dahulu untuk Papua dan Indonesia.  \n \nTeman-teman juga bisa membuat tulisan/kajian ilmiah sesuai dengan minat dan keahlian masing-masing, dengan didukung fakta dan sumber yang terpercaya. Dan dengan berkunjung secara langsung jika memang ada kesempatan, baik itu berlibur, kunjungan sosial, penelitian dll, dengan tentu saja bertanggung jawab (menghormati adat istiadat, menjaga kebersihan). \n \nMungkin ini hanya pendapat saya pribadi, teman-teman disini pasti punya masukan juga, sangat dipersilahkan untuk tanggapannya nih. \n  \nTKP PPI Dunia atau kependekan dari Tim Kajian Papua - PPI Dunia merupakan salah satu tim kajian yang lahir atas inisiasi Perhimpunan Pelajar Indonesia se-Dunia. TKP (Tim Kajian Papua) hadir untuk  mendukung perkembangan masyarakat di propinsi Papua Barat dan Papua (disingkat menjadi \u2018Papua\u2019).  \n  \nMelalui kajian online perdana ini TKP PPI Dunia hendak menyampaikan pesan kepada seluruh pelajar Indonesia di manapun berada untuk mengambil bagian dalam membangun bangsa secara bersama-sama. \u201cBerkontribusi Membangun Pariwisata Papua Barat\u201d sejalan dengan visi TKP PPI Dunia yaitu \u201cEksis memberi kontribusi nyata untuk Papua dan Indonesia\u201d dan yang menjadi fokus TKP pada tahun 2017 ini adalah di wilayah Papua Barat dengan menghasilkan: Kajian, Tulisan, dan Sumber Daya Manusia yang berkualitas. \n \nSemoga TKP PPI Dunia ini bisa eksis menjadi wadah untuk mempersatukan seluruh pelajar Indonesia di manapun berada yang memiliki perhatian khusus pada Papua dan Papua Barat. \n \nSumber : PPI Dunia","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indonesia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Beginilah Cara Untuk Mengembangkan Papua Lewat Penelitian","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"ID","country":"Indonesia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Good News From Indonesia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607470368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Good News From Indonesia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://ppidunia.org/"],"sequenceId":"695202300750","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Large-scale looting of commercial and business premises and even motorists was reported from the 10 worst affected districts. \n \nIn a communication to senior officers in districts, the Haryana government last week directed that security of all major critical points like drinking water supply to Delhi in Karnal and Sonipat, traffic movement on the G.T. road (National Highway No 1) and roadways depots should be secured. \n \nHaryana Director General of Police K.P. Singh said earlier that if anyone was found indulging in any illegal activity or causing loss to public property, action would be initiated against him. \n \nChief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said people should refrain from participating in any agitation.

Employers would like to know how the person will fit in with the team, the boss and the corporate culture. \n\nThats where Candidate.Guru comes in. The Boca Raton startups big-data solution predicts a potential culture fit between job seekers and employers without the need for surveys. When Candidate.Guru won the Miami Herald Business Plan Challenge last year -- it was named Challenge Champion in May -- it had about a dozen customers under trial. It had raised $475,000 in angel and friends and family funding and was embarking on a much larger seed round. \n\nSince then, the company has hit a number of milestones, said Chris Daniels , founder and CEO of the company. \n\nCandidate.Guru earlier this month completed a $950,000 equity financing round, predominately from Florida -based angel groups the FAN Fund , Florida Funders and Miami Innovation Fund . It added Greg Greene , former chief administrative officer and chief human resources officer of Ryder, to its advisory board. \n\nBuilding a company is never easy. If you do it for the wealth, you will fail. If you do it for the glory, you will fail. You should only do it if you have a genuine passion to do something great. Chris Daniels , Candidate.Guru \n\nOn the product development front, Candidate.Guru executed a license agreement with the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition based in Pensacola to incorporate some of its technology into Candidate.Gurus product, and it filed its first patent last year. The startup also partnered with KontactIntelligence to enable hospitals around the United States to hire more effectively. Candidate.Guru has about 20 corporate customers and is generating revenue. \n\nA challenge for any software company releasing its initial version is finding the right product-market fit, Daniels said. \"Finding that combination of features that triggers a big scale in customer adoption remains our biggest challenge and opportunity.\" \n\nGoing forward, Candidate.Guru, a team of seven, is working on acquiring \"an exciting set of new strategic partners that could take our product out to thousands of potential customers ... in key vertical markets and industries,\" Daniels said. \"We are also working on a number of state of Florida -based funding and strategic initiatives that will entrench us more deeply in the Florida entrepreneurial and technology ecosystem.\" Stay tuned. \n\nDaniels advice to Challenge contestants: \"Building a company is never easy. If you do it for the wealth, you will fail. If you do it for the glory, you will fail. You should only do it if you have a genuine passion to do something great. Building a company takes relentless courage, fearless ambition and a never-ending drive to succeed.\" \n\nNote: Chris Daniels will be speaking at the Miami Herald Business Plan Bootcamp Feb 28 . More info is here. \n\nRIDE2MD \n\nA year ago, George Fernandez incorporated his health-tech company, Ride2MD, and began building a team to power the companys mission of providing consumers with efficient, technology-enabled patient transportation to doctors offices, outpatient facilities and hospitals. At the time, Fernandez said Ride2MD aimed to be \"the Lyft for healthcare.\" \n\nIn fact, last summer, the healthcare transportation company partnered with Lyft . Business picked up almost immediately. \n\n\"Ride2MD is well on its way to success,\" said Fernandez, CEO of Ride2MD and the Peoples Pick and second place winner of the 2016 Miami \n\nHerald Business Plan Challenge. \"We started providing service on a daily basis in September and are bringing on new clients every month. We are developing relationships with hospitals, employers, insurers and health management companies and are about to start providing service in Colorado and Texas .\" \n\nBut that doesnt mean there havent been some route changes, said Fernandez, who was an executive in the health insurance industry before launching Ride2MD. \"The business, services we provide and even the client base we serve are significantly different than what we set out to do a year ago.\" \n\nIts about adjusting to what the market needs, he said. Medical providers continue to have issues with medical transportation, but the challenge has been these facilities dont have the budget to pay for it, so Ride2MD has been mainly targeting self-paying patients, at least for the time being. \n\n\"As an entrepreneur, you must be flexible and willing to try -- and fail,\" Fernandez said. \"The key has been to recognize what didnt work quickly and find alternatives. As with any business, the most important asset is people, dedicated and fearless people.\" \n\nAbout a quarter of Ride2MDs business now comes through a burgeoning medical tourism industry in South Florida . Service for international patients arriving in Miami for medical visits or treatments also includes VIP services such as pickups at the airport. \n\nFernandez said about 20 percent of his business comes through the Lyft partnership. As Ride2MD gets requests for transportation, it makes sure the ride-share service is sufficient for the patients and that the drivers understand any special needs. \n\nRide2MD is continuing to partner with National Health Transport , which offers ambulance services as well as non-emergency transportation. \"Together, we are providing service for a small community hospital. Service has improved and the expense to the hospital has come down, so everybody wins,\" Fernandez said. \n\nFernandezs advice to Challenge contestants: \"Dont be afraid to fail, just make sure you learn why it failed so you can move forward. Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you and are willing to help. Make sure you can deliver on what you say in the press.\" \n\nSHOES DSIRE \n\nFor tech startup Shoes Dsire, the past year has been a learning experience for the founders -- and their app. \n\nShoes Dsire, co-founded by Walter and Jane \n\nBernacca of Aventura , is a free social commerce app that uses visual search technology to serve up fast and personalized shoe-shopping experiences. \n\nWhen we left off with the Bernaccas, third-place winners in the Miami Business Plan Challenge, they had already put their free iPhone app through a number of iterations, and it had more than 15,000 active users. Since then, the app has attracted more early adopters and its Instagram following has nearly doubled, but the companys focus has been on improving the back end of its platform, so that the app better understands the behavior of its users. \n\nA key feature of the app is image recognition: Users can snap a picture of shoes they like and learn where they can buy the same or similar shoes for less money. \n\nA key feature of the app is image recognition: Users can snap a picture of shoes they like and learn where they can buy the same or similar shoes for less money. \"We never stop to improve the app in many aspects, but last week we released a new image recognition code much more powerful that will provide an even better user experience,\" Walter said. \n\n\"Our goal this year is to invest in machine learning to understand behavior of the users, and to deliver more information to the brands, in other words, big data. The user experience is much more important to us at this moment than launching new features,\" Walter said. This, the founders believe, will be very desirable to brands that could incorporate the technology, especially with e-commerce continuing to increase. \n\nAnother key goal for the year is to launch an Android version of the app. \n\nTo fund this development and growth, Shoes Dsire, now a team of eight, hopes to raise $3 million in funding, and is looking for a strategic investor with knowledge of the shoe and fashion industry. In the past, it has raised about \n\n$1 million in seed funding. \n\n\"Because of everything we did last year, big companies are starting to talk to us,\" Walter said. \"We see a huge opportunity right now with so many big companies closing some of their physical stores, like Macys and Kenneth Cole , and investing more on their online business. Shoes Dsire technology can be a great tool for these business.\" \n\nWalter Bernaccas advice to Challenge contestants: \n\n\"Always be ready with your elevator pitch. You never know who and when you will have the opportunity to pitch about it.\" \n\n___ \n\n(c)2017 Miami Herald \n\nVisit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com \n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n\nThe post appeared first on InsuranceNewsNet .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"South Florida news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"You need genuine passion to do something great; don\u2019t be afraid to try, fail, learn from it","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Insurance News Net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664758","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Insurance News Net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.insurancenewsnet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202320508","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The NBR has those reports.\"\n\nFinance Minister AMA Muhith followed up the statement and told the media the next day a probe will be launched into it.\n\nThe statement described it as a 'completely baseless accusation.' It said all organisations created by Yunus pay tax, VAT and none of them enjoys any tax benefit.\n\nOn Wednesday, an angry Hasina went on to describe Yunus as a 'cheat' over Grameenphone as he breached the promise he made before setting up the telecom entity.\n\n\"This lobbying that he did...at that time he obtained the Grameenphone (GP) licence from me. Ask him, did he even offer me a cup of tea for the licence? \"On the contrary, it was I who invited him to my office, offered him tea and gave him business,\" a miffed prime minister said adding he did not pass on the profits from the telecoms venture to Grameen Bank.\n\nThe statement said that GP was joint venture with Norway's state-owned Telenor as the lead partner and Grameen Telecom, a non-profit entity with no private owners and registered under the Company Act, was the second owner.\n\nYunus Centre claimed that profits from GP that come to Grameen Telecom are used for projects that 'support the welfare of the common people' through Grameen Telecom Trust.\n\nIt said all GP documents are available with the government.\n\n\"Professor Yunus never owned any share of Grameenphone at any stage of the company, nor does he own any share now. Therefore, the question of his selling shares to anyone does not arise. \n\n\"Similarly, since Grameen Bank did not own any share of Grameenphone at any time, the question of Grameen Bank selling shares of GP does not arise either. Grameen Telecom never sold any of its shares to anyone except in the case of selling shares to general public, as agreed by all partners of Grameenphone and the Government of Bangladesh,\" the statement added.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Bangladesh news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Yunus Centre protests PM Hasina's statement m...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202321433","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/93e1907a18bec779633229da5b7e127f.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I\u2019m very excited, but it\u2019s a grind now to play every day -- practice every day,\u201d Moquette said. \n \n\u201cA lot of people always told me that I always had the ability to [get drafted]. But it was that extra moment, the extra motivations that I gave myself, to push myself to be able to get drafted, and become the person that I am today as a player.\u201d \n \nMoquette has been making the most of his opportunity. After starting off slowly for the Orioles' Short Season Class A affiliate, Moquette has improved steadily this season. While his average is only at .208, he has the club lead with eight home runs and is tied for the IronBirds lead with 25 RBIs.  \n \nMoquette\u2019s accomplishment was not just for him, it was for his country and a culture that taught him to love the game of baseball at a very young age. \n \n\u201cEvery Dominican kid\u2019s dream is to become a baseball player to see how far they can make it, how far they can go,\u201d Moquette shared. \n \nAnd it was also for his mother, the woman who motivated him to keep pushing even when his path was mobbed by obstacles. \n \n\u201cI always wanted to do it for my mom,\u201d Moquette said. \u201cI wanted to better myself and help her out with anything because she\u2019s always been the one saying \u2018yeah you got it, anything you need, you know I\u2019ll do it for you.\u2019\" \n \nSince getting drafted, Moquette admits that his life has changed but that his love of the game is what fuels his ability to get up and play every day. \n \n\u201cMy life has really changed but I love it. I don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s a little bit tiring because it\u2019s my first year, but you get used to it after those first couple of weeks.\u201d \n \nMoquette admits that he had to adjust to the speed of the game after he struggled earlier in the season. \n \n\u201c[I wasn't used to] seeing guys with a ninety-five-mile per hour fastball. Up in the Northeast in Division 3, you\u2019d never see that. But then again I can\u2019t tell myself I can\u2019t hit that because I know I can. You just put your foot down and you go with it.\u201d \n \n\u201cI would say [the minor leagues] is ninety-nine percent different than it is at UMass Boston right now. Especially being from the northeast and playing at sixty-five degree weather pretty much every day of my senior year. The pitching is so much better, the hitting is so much faster.\u201d \n \nMoquette attributes a lot of his success to his former manager at UMass Boston. \n \n\u201cCoach [Brendan] Eygabroat [helped] me a lot. I used to live in the weight room in the fall and it just helped me to get to where I am now.\u201d \n \nAlthough many have helped the 6\u20193, 215 pound outfielder along the way, he expressed that his motivation and drive to push himself is a big reason why he is where he is today \n \n\u201cJust to have that drive, that drive to know that I can make it. If there is a point in your life when you know you can do it, you have to do it yourself and make it happen.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: baseball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Former Beacon baseball star Moquette begins his professional career","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"02125","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Boston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"University of Boston Mass Media","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169859182","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"University of Boston Mass Media","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.umassmedia.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202332127","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country.

He also transmitted power to his second- in- command, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the authority to act while he is away. The statement by Buhari\u2019s spokesperson, Femi Adesina, further said that Buhari would also undergo medical check-ups during his vacation. It is surprising that no sooner had these got into public domain than the social media and a section of the orthodox print and electronic media \u2013 TV and Radio stations \u2013 went berserk. They insinuated that President Buhari had either passed on in a London hospital or more outlandishly \u201ccommitted suicide\u201d while on his medical tourism for some undisclosed terminal ailment. \n \nIt is dizzying that this is traceable to some foreign agencies based in Arizona in the United States. Checks have since confirmed that the hoax was the handiwork of cybersquatters and website spoofs, purporting to be Metro newspaper of UK or Huffington Post of United States owned by WILD WEST DOMAINS. According to whois.domaintools.com, the sites \u2013 \u201cHuffington\u201d was registered on November 19, 2016, and \u201cMetro\u201d on October 25, 2016.  We are stupefied that Nigerian media, ever willing to seek validation for such outlandish stories from foreign media dedicated prime times and pages to celebrate this hogwash. These fake sites, apparently ignorant of diplomacy and protocols referred to the \u201cNigerian Embassy\u201d in London, instead of \u201cHigh Commission\u201d as their sources and further committed a worse hara-kiri by alleging that a statement had been issued by the Nigerian mission. If the president actually dies, the announcement will be made in Abuja, not London! \n \nPresidential spokespersons \u2013 Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu \u2013 have been upbeat, debunking vehemently the snide reports and tried to out-do the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed in condemning those indecorously celebrating morbidity. They have published pictures in the cyberspace showing the president relaxing and watching TV over there in the UK and another set of photographs, showing the Governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun and Senator Daisy Danjuma in a relaxed mood with President Buhari. But the \u201cwailers\u201d would not see these as portraying the true state of the President and assurances of him being in good health. \n \nIt is benumbing that Nigerians and some so-called friends of Nigeria would wish the President dead. While we see this as an expression of the frustration of many with the state of affairs in the country, it beats us hollow that it has gained currency and all attempts at dousing the tension have further heated up the polity instead. We found it absurd how hate campaigners satanically brought the Vice President resigning his appointment into the whole absurdity. We cannot understand how the people react to a man\u2019s demise in a society like ours, where it is unheard of to speak ill of the dead. We are, however, not unmindful of the fact that reaction to someone\u2019s death is totally dependent on how the man treated his people while alive and in power. That was the case when General Murtala Muhammed died in office in 1976 and later General Sani Abacha in 1998. We are also conscious of the lop-sidedness in the information management architecture of the government at the moment and failure to handle basic rules of media reportage of crises situations as we now have in our hands. Sad enough, Nigeria has a long history of leaders lying about their health and it may take another lifetime to know the truth about former President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, former Taraba State Governor Dambaba Suntai or even Patience, the wife of former President Goodluck Jonathan. Their illnesses were shrouded in mysteries as if they were superhuman. Their kitchen cabinet or cabals simply churned out conflicting reports about what should be seen as simply vicissitudes associated with human existence. \n \nWe call on all agents of misinformation and those not through with the hogwash that was propaganda and hate campaign of the last general elections to know that politics needs to give way to policies and governance now. We need alternative actions and positions that can better the economy and social engineering in the country. Spin doctors in the corridors of powers must muster courageous professional dignity to discountenance patently false, inciting and potentially divisive actions and statements from enemies of the government. Reacting with \u201cpuerile peevishness\u201d does not glamourise them nor sustain them in their high offices. For us, there is a time frame given for this holiday, Nigerians should be calm and wait for February 6, when the President is expected back in office. \n \nThis post was syndicated from Nigerian News from Leadership News.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 46 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202339759","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kejriwal will never protect the interests of the state, said Captain Amarinder, pinning down the AAP leader on the widespread corruption and other crimes, rape and sex scandals, in which his own party leaders were embroiled.With many of his own MLAs in Delhi in jail on various criminal charges, and he himself under probe in a corruption case along with his brother-in-law, Kejriwal\u2019s credentials had been blasted to smithereens and his tall claims of providing good governance had been completely exposed in Delhi, Captain Amarinder pointed out, warning the people against handing over their interests to a corrupt liar like Kejriwal.Asserting that he would give the Akalis a massive beating all over Punjab, where the Congress party\u2019s internal analysis was giving SAD no more than 14 seats, Captain Amarinder explained that he had been unable to come to Lambi after filing his nomination papers as he was going all over the state to ensure that the Badals are wiped out from Punjab for good. \n \nReacting to Sukhbir\u2019s promise of loan waiver for farmers, Captain Amarinder asked, to humungous response, \u201cwas he sleeping the last 10 years?\u201d Expressing concern over the suicides by farmers in Punjab, he reiterated his promise to waive off all their loans immediately after coming to power.Referring to the SYL issue, Captain Amarinder said construction of the canal, which the Akalis had failed to stop and which Arvind Kejriwal would allow in the interest of his native state of Haryana, would adversely affected 6 lakh families in southern Punjab. \u201cWe cannot allow that to happen at any cost,\u201d he declared.Captain Amarinder\u2019s remarks came even as, at Panjwan, the Haryana Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee extended its support to the Punjab Congress in the assembly polls. \n \nThe PPCC president lamented the injustice meted out to Punjab in water-sharing, which had enabled Haryana to get more water despite being a smaller state post reorganization.In Panjwan, Muktsar DCC president Gurmeet Khudian said Badals\u2019 tyranny was worse than that of Aurangzeb. Sukhbir\u2019s OSDs were running a reign of terror in Punjab, he said, charging the Badals with spreading communal polarization. He cited the increase in the incidents of sacrilege and the crash in land prices under the Badal regime to underline the mess prevailing in Punjab after 10 years of their rule. Only the Congress, he said, could rescue the state and its people from the prevailing conditions.Sharing the stage with Captain Amarinder was Mahesh Indersingh Badal, who had quit SAD some weeks back, alleging intimidation by Sukhbir and attempt to implicate him in false case by the local police.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Massive response to Captain Amarinder Singh in Badal citadel of Lambi","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"5 Dariya News - English","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"535062281","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"5 Dariya News - English","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Regional","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.5dariyanews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202341617","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harrison","zipCode":"39507","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gulfport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6447"},"name":"Sun Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sunherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202344072","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Not that either. What it does show is how difficult it can be to sort the hype from reliable dietary advice when studies are funded by the makers of Froot Loops, nutrition science is often inconclusive, and gray areas can be spun for marketing. \n \nTake Special K. In the 1990s, Special K boxes featured findings that people who didn't normally eat breakfast lost more weight after they started doing so. \n \n\"That was the little piece they put on the cereal box,\" said David Schlundt, a co-author of the study of about 50 women. Not mentioned on those boxes: Regular breakfast eaters who started skipping the meal lost even more weight, compared to those who stuck with their routines. \n \nThat doesn't mean particular breakfasts can't help some people control their appetites, or bring other benefits like energy. Schlundt's study was tiny. But it shows how easy it is to simplify the complexities and limitations of nutrition science and cherry-pick the findings. \n \nOur understanding of what's healthy can evolve, which is why dietary guidelines are regularly updated to reflect the latest science. A recommendation that breakfast can help with weight control \u2014 inserted in 2010 \u2014 is no longer in the guidelines. With its last update, the government says it looked at broader eating patterns. \n \nA look at some research around breakfast and weight illustrates why advice about it is so tricky. \n \n\"White hat\" bias \n \nTo investigate the long-held idea that breakfast can prevent weight gain, researchers in 2013 reviewed dozens of studies examining the premise. Their conclusion: Popular opinion outweighed the scientific evidence. \n \nA major issue they identified was that studies often misleadingly used language to indicate that breakfast influenced weight, even though the findings did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Like a lot of nutrition research, the studies drew links between physical traits and what people said they ate. \n \n\"It goes back to the idea that correlation doesn't equal causation,\" said Andrew Brown, one of the researchers who conducted the analysis. Brown, a nutrition scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, noted that it could be that heavier people were skipping breakfast in hopes of losing weight. \n \nWhen citing past studies, scientists also tended to mischaracterize inconclusive results in favor of breakfast. Brown chalked that up to \"white hat\" bias, since people are constantly told breakfast is \"the most important meal of the day.\" \n \nBrown also noted that \"breakfast\" can consist of any number of possibilities, whether it's cold pizza, yogurt or an egg sandwich. \n \nIt's possible to question all sorts of dietary ideas. A study published last month, for instance, said the science behind recommendations to limit sugar was weak. That study drew criticism from health advocates because it was paid for by an industry group that includes Coke and Hershey \u2014 but it underscored the vulnerability of dietary recommendations. \n \nTimothy Caulfield, an expert in health law and policy at the University of Alberta, said nutrition science often comes with uncertainties and shouldn't be discarded just because it doesn't provide slam-dunk evidence. He said health experts give advice on the best available research, but there needs to be greater understanding about its limitations. \n \nWith breakfast and weight, Caulfield said there hasn't been a pendulum swing in the data, just that the evidence doesn't seem as powerful as once believed. \n \n\"Not good, not good\" \n \nDisclosures about who paid for the research became the norm only in recent years, so it's unclear how much of the literature on breakfast and weight from past decades was funded by breakfast food makers. The 1992 study featured on Special K boxes, for example, doesn't list a funding source. Schlundt told the AP that Kellogg paid for it. \n \n\"Only the ideas they see as favorable get money,\" Schlundt, an associate professor at Vanderbilt, said of industry-funded research. \n \nEven when funding is disclosed, people may not realize that not all studies are that meaningful. \n \n\"The paper is not good, not good = There are major structural problems with it that cannot be fixed,\" Carol O'Neil, a professor at Louisiana State University, wrote to her co-author in 2011 about a Kellogg-funded study, according to emails obtained through a records request. \n \nO'Neil and her co-author wanted to withdraw the paper from submission, but felt they couldn't because Kellogg expected it to be published. When the paper kept coming back with notes, O'Neil said she didn't see a way around the problems. \n \n\"But let me look at the comments again and see if there is some sort of clever verbiage we can present,\" she wrote. \n \nThe paper did not find a link between cereal consumption among Mexican-American children and better weight, but found one between cereal and higher nutrient intake. As eventually published in 2013, it concluded that nourishing breakfasts \u2014 including those with cereal \u2014 should be encouraged. \n \nO'Neil did not respond to requests for comment. Kellogg said it is unable to comment on the study and the research by Schlundt because they were done long ago. General Mills, which has funded studies about breakfast, cereal and weight, declined to comment. \n \nAnother study funded by Kellogg last year found breakfast consumption was not consistently linked with differences in weight among Canadian adults. It found people who ate cereal had lower weights than those who ate other types of breakfast, though results varied by age and sex. \n \nYoni Freedhoff, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa, said many of his patients find protein-rich breakfasts help control their appetites. Yet he noted that breakfast studies are often funded by cereal makers, and look specifically at cereal. \n \nThose studies can help shape policy. In its 2010 guidelines, the U.S. government cited breakfast as a way to manage weight. Of the 15 studies involving children mentioned to support the recommendation, five listed funding from General Mills or Kellogg, with three looking specifically at cereal. \n \nWith its 2015 update, though, the government decided to look instead at \"the combination of what you eat and drink over time,\" according to the Health and Human Services Department. \n \nAs a result, it no longer recommends breakfast for weight loss. \n \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Candice ChoiAP Food Industry Writer"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: health news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Can breakfast help keep us thin?

In practice, experts say, that policy will freeze millions of dollars in funding that has gone to critical health treatment, including HIV testing and neonatal care. \n \nThe United States does not fund any abortion services overseas, but many health groups receive American assistance to provide other women's services, while using different funding sources to provide abortion counseling and procedures. Now, those organizations will have to stop providing abortion services if they want to continue to receive U.S. aid for their other programs. The policy is known as the \"global gag rule\" because it even restricts references to abortion in counseling sessions. \n \nOrganizations such as Planned Parenthood, which receives about $100 million per year from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), have said that they will continue to provide abortion services, forgoing the U.S. funding and closing other programs. But other groups will probably stop providing the services. \n \n\"There will definitely be an increase in unmet need, and some women might lose lives because of exposure to unsafe abortions,\" said Yilma Melkamu, director for programs at the International Planned Parenthood Federation. \n \nIn Kenya, public health experts raised immediate concerns about the new policy. Women here often resort to dangerous methods to end their pregnancies, including drinking battery acid and using wire coat hangers. In parts of rural Kenya, young women have hired local healers to stomp on their stomachs until the pregnancy is deemed over. \n \n\"Trump's policy means even fewer services will be offered,\" said Chimaraoke Izugbara, a researcher at the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) in Nairobi. \"Some women will not be reached, and providers may not be available to offer services. I think we are headed to a major disaster.\" \n \nNearly 8,000 women in Kenya die every year from complications caused by pregnancy and childbirth. At least a fifth of those deaths are caused by self-induced abortions, according to Izugbara. \n \nGroups that oppose abortion celebrated the new U.S. policy. Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said it would \"put an end to taxpayer funding of groups that promote the killing of unborn children in developing nations.\" \n \nMost sub-Saharan African countries have restrictive abortion laws. In Kenya, for example, abortion is legal only if a doctor decides there is a \"need for emergency treatment.\" Private organizations are often the only option for women in search of safe access to abortion. \n \nIn some cases, those women were the victims of sexual violence, according to Planned Parenthood, including refugees who were raped. Each year, about 1.6 million women on the continent are treated for complications from unsafe abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization based in New York. \n \nThe International Planned Parenthood Federation uses its USAID funding to provide contraceptives in Ethiopia, counseling for HIV/AIDS patients in Kenya and family planning services in Nepal, among other things. Some of those programs will probably be shuttered when the group loses U.S. aid. \n \nIn a statement, the group said it \"will not support policies which actively restrict or take away an individual's right to choose.\" \n \nA similar policy was implemented under President George W. Bush. Researchers discovered that the policy seemed to lead to \"increases in abortion rates in sub-Saharan African countries,\" according to a report published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization in 2011. \n \n\"The results were exactly the opposite as the intended effect of the policy,\" said Eran Bendavid, one of the researchers and an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University. \n \nOne possible reason for the increase was that the U.S. policy, while aimed at abortion, curtailed the activities of organizations that provided condoms and other birth-control methods, resulting in more unwanted pregnancies, the study said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kevin SieffThe Washington Post"},"topics":[],"title":"Trump's revival of the antiabortion 'gag rule' could have a big impact in Africa","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202344852","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mylan's chief executive, Heather Bresch, found herself following in the footsteps of another pharmaceutical executive who engaged in a massive price hike, Martin Shkreli, at a Congressional hearing last year. \n \nMylan has faced competitors before \u2014 including from the Auvi-Q before it was recalled from the market. But EpiPen's market dominance and familiarity to patients and doctors, as well as by various issues with its competitors, meant that Mylan has been able to dominate the epinephrine auto-injector space. \n \nNow, EpiPen will go head-to-head with Auvi-Q and with the authorized generic of another auto-injector called Adrenaclick. Last week, CVS Health said it would offer a two-pack of the generic version of Adrenaclick for $110. \n \nMylan is readying itself for competition; it launched an authorized generic of EpiPen late last year, at half the list price \u2014 $300 for a two-pack. \n \nThe list prices for these three products are all over the map: the Auvi-Q, which comes with a voice that talks patients through how to administer the injection, is priced at a slight premium to Mylan's generic EpiPen, which is further undercut by the CVS price for Adrenaclick's generic. \n \nBut the list price doesn't reflect what insurers pay because they negotiate secret rebates and discounts. It also doesn't reflect what patients generally pay, because insurance often passes through only part of the cost, through a co-pay or co-insurance. The growth in high deductible plans, in which patients are on the hook for the full cost of a drug until they hit a dollar limit, is thought to have helped spur public outrage about EpiPen because consumers were increasingly exposed to the escalating list price. \n \nThe three companies are offering various kinds of coupons and patient affordability programs to defray the cost to consumers even further. Those programs reveal the varied patchwork that makes drugs affordable. \n \nFor example, the Auvi-Q will be free to patients with commercial insurance \u2014 even if they have a high deductible plan, according to Kaléo. In addition to offering a $110 cash price at CVS for the Adrenaclick generic, the company Impax Laboratories is offering a $100 coupon. Mylan is offering a $25 coupon off out of pocket costs for its authorized generic. Coupons cannot be used by people with government insurance. \n \nIn a broader sense, these options will give insurers more leverage when trying to negotiate the price of the medication.

He might enjoy knowing that Trump's America is snapping up translations of his homoerotically tinged work even as the country toys with banning Muslims and rolling back gay rights. \n \nRumi, like Omar Khayyam, has become the warm and fuzzy ecumenical poet of choice for weddings, coming-of-age ceremonies and funerals. A benign mist dews our lens on a golden-age Islam. Edward Said would rap our bourgeois knuckles for the way we idealize classical Persia. \n \nNow, to rescue Rumi from this inane Orientalizing comes the poet, novelist and biographer Brad Gooch with \"Rumi's Secret.\" A dazzling feat of scholarship, but a pedestrian read, the book restores Rumi to the glories and hardships of his momentous age. Gooch spent nearly eight years on the project, learning Persian and traveling to Rumi-relevant lands including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria and Turkey, co-translating the verse he quotes, steeping himself in scores of books, and interviewing Rumi luminaries and acolytes. \n \nBuilding particularly on Franklin Lewis' \"Rumi\" (2000), Gooch manages to paint an accessible, tangible portrait of the ancient poet. He makes real for us Rumi's boyhood travels from his home in the Tajik village of Vakhsh, his studies in Aleppo and Damascus, and his family and religious life in Konya, in what is now Turkey. Gooch explores Rumi's relationship not just with Shams, the older spiritual intimate with whom he became obsessed, but also \u2014 later, after Shams' suspicious disappearance \u2014 with a goldsmith, Salah, and then with Hosam, trusted longtime friend and treasurer of the informal religious order that had formed around Rumi. \n \nShams made Rumi question the expectations for his respectable and predictable future. He brought out the religious leader's budding mystic inclinations, including an unorthodox love of music and dance in which Rumi's prayers began to evolve into poetry and song. Was sex involved in the men's many cloistered hours together? \"While no evidence exists of an erotic component,\" Gooch writes, \"Rumi chose to speak of their spiritual love in the mode of Persian romantic love poetry, and from weaving the two came his evanescent message.\" In other words, who knows? \n \nRumi's masterwork, the six-volume spiritual epic \"The Masnavi,\" shivers with infinite devotion, but also infinite loss. Shams may have been murdered by one of Rumi's sons in jealous conspiracy with other apostles who felt the older mystic was undermining Rumi's calling. Or Shams may have felt driven away. Or he may have left to teach Rumi a lesson about separation. After all, he'd done that before. In any case, Shams' disappearance, absent any resolution, perhaps echoed in Rumi's mind other losses such as the death of his father and the destruction of his boyhood homes by the Mongol armies of the Khans, whose authority increasingly encroached on Konya as well. \n \nThe book's title, \"Rumi's Secret,\" is more a tease than a biographical agenda. For if you consider the secret the nature of Rumi's intimacy with Shams or the perpetual mystery underlying great poetic talent, then Rumi's secret rests securely with him in his tomb. Then again, the poet's secret might be no secret at all. Fasting, whirling, dancing and reciting while Hosam acted as scribe, Rumi, like mystics before and since, may have looked increasingly inward as the outward showed signs of toppling all around him. Worn down to his physical, spiritual and elegiac essence, he turned his back on worldly factions and reached out to Christians and Jews, tradesmen and lepers. At the risk of heresy, he found direct connection to God, to Mohammed and to the Koran, to which he brazenly considered his \"Masnavi\" a complement. \n \n\"Rumi's Secret\" is a strangely dry read considering it has a literally whirling mystic as its subject. As if fearing that too lyrical an approach to such an orphic figure would result in incoherence, Gooch describes this poet's life in a decidedly unpoetic way. He offers conscientious chronology: who traveled where, studied with whom, won which royals as patrons, and so on. And he gives us some helpful exegesis, for instance, in explaining a surrealistic dream passage by Rumi drawing on a 40-day period of bread-and-water subsistence in total isolation. But this book won't get anyone excited about Rumi. Instead, it will give those already excited about Rumi help in contextualizing his work. \n \nLook at what has become of Aleppo and Damascus, the centers of learning of Rumi's young manhood. Look at today's tatters of his ecumenical outreach. What power compels millions nonetheless to seek out his healing verses? One wishes that Gooch, for all the years he put into understanding Rumi, would offer, beyond quotes from a few Rumi scholars and enthusiasts, some deeper speculation along these lines. \n \nGooch does equip us to make some guesses of our own. Perhaps in a world of warlords, sects and terror, the enduring appeal is the immediate spiritual self-determination that Rumi promises: \n \nOh brother, you are nothing but your thoughts \n \nThe rest of you is merely skin and bones \n \nIf your thought is a rose, you are a rose garden \n \nIf your thought is a thorn, you are fuel for the fire. \n \nOr do we see ourselves reflected in Rumi's melancholic ambiguities? \"The religion of love,\" he asserts, \"is beyond all faiths.\" With the Middle East again aflame, the West in another bitter parochial crouch, one wonders, does that mean that supreme love is accessible to all of us, or to none? \n \nAlexander C.

The state database tracks a person\u2019s prescription history in efforts to avoid drug shopping habits by people with a substance abuse disorder. \n \nVeterinarians were included in the state PMP because there have been reports across the country of addicted people diverting medications like Tramadol, Ketamine and Valium, intended for a pet\u2019s care but used by the pet owner instead. \n \nCindy Heister, a longtime employee at the New Hampshire Board of Veterinary Medicine, part of the state\u2019s department of agriculture, said she has heard that some vets have had suspicions that drugs were being diverted and misused, but they are few in New Hampshire. She said in her 20 years, she can only remember about four times when this was brought to her attention. \n \n\u201cI have heard of Tramadol being a drug of concern since it is a narcotic prescribed to animals,\u201d Heister said. \u201cWe would report any information we received on misuse to the State Police. We would not handle it here.\u201d \n \nRepresentative Carol McGuire, R-Epsom, a sponsor of the bill, said it came about partly because there was an unanticipated fiscal impact to veterinarian\u2019s if they take part in the PDM as the rules are written. She said the bill could be used to amend the rules to address the impact if the Legislature decides vets need to be included in the PDM. \n \n\u201cFirst, a veterinarian\u2019s patients are not in the PDM database,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cIt is extra effort for them to do this. This is also an ethical issue for some vets who do not feel they are equipped to check on the pet owners, who are not their patients.\u201d \n \nMcGuire said the result might be that it is no longer mandatory for veterinarians but it could be optional, giving them more leeway on doing the database checks. \n \nState Rep. Jim Belanger, R-Hillsborough, testified in favor of HB291 on Tuesday, on behalf of his son, who is a veterinarian. \n \n\u201cSay my son treated my dog named Buddy, who needs medication for a hip injury,\u201d Belanger said. \u201cIf I sent the dog to the vet, he is supposed to do a background check on me? I feel my family\u2019s medical information is none of the vet\u2019s business.\u201d \n \nBelanger said he thinks the bill is too far reaching. \n \n\u201cI understand the concept, what it is intended for,\u201d Belanger said. \u201cI think it is flawed and needs to be looked at. I am not even sure how you could know what a person does with the medication once they leave the vet\u2019s.\u201d \n \nDr. Steve Crawford, state veterinarian and ex-officio member of the board of veterinarian medicine, said he has not, and will not take an official stand on the bill.  \n \n\"HB1423 required various prescribing standards, and veterinarian medicine was treated very differently,\" Crawford said. \"Veterinarians would be expected to query the PDM for the pet owner, not for the pet. There were comments from veterinarians and that's partly where this came from.\" \n \nA big questions from the vets, Crawford said, is what would they be required to do with the information from such a query. \n \n\"The vets' concerns are that they cannot make a diagnosis for a person,\" said Crawford. \"The Board of Medicine said vets have to make the query but didn't spell out what to do.\" \n \nCrawford said some compromises were discussed at Tuesday's public hearing, including using a microchip in the pet as opposed to trying to learn about the pet owner, Another suggestion is that pharmacists could make the query when the pet owner comes in to fill a script. \n \n\"There are probably solutions to be found,\" Crawford said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Karen Dandurant"},"topics":[],"title":"Rules could change in NH for veterinarians","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202345875","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It could be digging a hole, same principle. Unfortunately, most people do not exercise regularly. Suddenly they go outside to move what could be hundreds of pounds of snow. It\u2019s like going to the gym for the first time and going wild.\u201d \n \nDr. Jeffrey Kuvin, a cardiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, said people tend to be less active in the winter months than they do in the warm weather, so even a person who is usually in good shape may be less so this time of year. \n \nAnother factor working against people who are out of shape is the cold. \n \n\u201cSnow is wet and heavy, and we are going from a warm, cuddly house, outside to tackle the snow piles,\u201d Kuvin said. \u201cWe feel obligated to take on this strenuous behavior, which taxes our muscles and our heart.\u201d \n \nKuvin said there is some evidence that the blood thins in the cold, increasing blood clotting factors. \n \n\u201cWhen you go from a warm house to outside in the cold, blood vessels constrict. Clotting factors work harder and a blood clot is more likely. Blood pressure and heart rate increases with the activity. It is a perfect setup for a heart attack so not a big surprise when it happens.\u201d \n \nFor many who are stricken, there may be an underlying heart condition that the person is not aware of, said Goodkin. \n \n\u201cSometimes, the symptoms are misread,\u201d said Kuvin. \u201cPeople attribute the chest and muscle pain, the sweating, dizziness and nausea to the stress of the activity. Be very aware of the symptoms and what they could mean.\u201d \n \n\u201cI tell my patients to not underestimate the power of snow,\u201d Goodkin said. \u201cI tell them to treat it like the gym and warm-up first with some stretches or light exercise indoors. When they shovel, take light loads and rest breaks as needed. Make sure to stay hydrated.\u201d \n \nA heart attack is not the only risk when shoveling snow. Dr. Richard Feeney of Core Physiatry in Exeter said shoveling snow is a great way to injure the back. \n \n\u201cWe see a lot of people in pain in our practice,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cShoveling snow is a common cause of back pain related to the spine. We see a lot of lumbar disc herniation, injury to the soft tissue between vertebrae.\u201d \n \nFeeney said shoveling is the perfect storm for spinal injuries. \n \n\u201cLeaning forward is a flexor stressor,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cThen there is a lot of rotation involved. There is increased pressure to the intervertebral discs. This can happen as a natural part of aging, too, but shoveling is a good contributor. People who may not be in the best shape are suddenly going from zero to 60.\u201d \n \nKuvin said people should consider whether they are physically fit enough to shovel snow, or if they should consider getting help from others. \n \n\u201cIf you take it on by yourself, know your limitations,\u201d Kuvin said. \u201cWarm up and acclimate yourself to the cold. Most important is to know when you have reached your limit and stop. We see a lot of patients who decided to shovel or snow blow their driveway, and had a heart attack.\u201d \n \nFeeney said if a person does take part in a core stabilization program, he or she strengthens the core and is better able to tolerate shoveling. \n \n\u201cIf not, a better idea might be to delegate,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cI ask my patients \u2013 would you rather pay a neighborhood kid $10 or hire a plow person, or risk the injury?\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Karen Dandurant"},"topics":[],"title":"Shoveling snow safely","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202350506","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I would call it a tryst \u2014 with sex the same time and the same place almost every day in a five-day workweek. \"Count 'em!\" That's about 1,000 encounters, taking time out for the birth of three babies, vacations, etc. \n \nThe hurt has been indescribable. I think about it constantly. Fortunately, I have found a psychologist I can vent to. I keep telling myself it was 55 years ago, but it seems like yesterday. I still have my unfaithful wife; she has no place to go, and alas, I still love her. \n \nDuring that five-year period, three boys were born. The last one I am sure is not mine. He is aware that he is different from his siblings and has asked me whether he could have been switched at birth. The biological father is dead. I think our son should know who he was, but his mother does not. We are 80 years old and the only ones to know, and time is running out to tell him. With doctors using DNA information and with Ancestry.com, etc., it is only a matter of time before he finds out he has different genes than his siblings. \n \nI love him very much and don't want him to think I was involved in wife swapping or somehow a party to the affair. It is bad enough to know that he is the product of a cheating mother. My wife tells me she has no remorse, guilt or shame, but she cares about what our son would think of her. Tell him? Your opinion, please. \u2014 It Was \"Only\" Sex \n \nDear Only: Should you tell your son? I'm inclined to say no. There's no point in upsetting the balance and making him feel more like an outsider. Besides, he already knows who his real dad is: you. \n \nBut if his biological father suffered from any conditions of which genetics are a good predictor, then your son should be aware of that medical history. Raise that concern with your wife. She should want him to be equipped with all the best information to lead a long, healthy life. \n \nI can't imagine the range of emotions you must be cycling through on a daily basis. I'm happy that you've found a therapist who can help you process things. Keep going. The sting of your wife's revelation will lessen with time. \n \nDear Annie: I just read the letter from \"Inbox Infinity,\" who was stressed out by having nearly 7,000 unread emails. I understand completely. I procrastinate, have generalized anxiety and attention deficit disorder, and am a perfectionist. \n \nPlease suggest to \"Inbox\" that he or she can start the culling process painlessly by signing up for Unroll.Me, which was suggested to me by a website for adults with ADD. It is an amazing, simple program that will compile your incoming emails into a \"daily digest\" and make it easy to unsubscribe from what you don't want. \n \nUnroll.Me will not do anything about the emails already archived in your inbox, however. It only organizes incoming mail. For those 7,000 pesky emails, I would suggest some tough love. Delete them. Simple as that. If they haven't been looked at in a week, a month or a year, they most likely are not important or have expired. Don't even look at them. Just delete them! \n \nAs for family members, consider emailing them after the purge, explaining that you want to reconnect but recently deleted a whole bunch of emails. They will understand, as they probably have several thousand archived emails also! \u2014 Been There, Done That \n \nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"DEAR ANNIE: The fruit of an affair","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202350684","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With a little preplanning, however, a healthy lunch can assist with fueling, nutritional, and weight goals. \n \nWhen lunches are eaten out, they can often contribute to excess calories, low nutrient intake, overconsumption of less healthy food ingredients, and fatigue (as the body focuses on digesting larger amounts of food or \u201cheavier\u201d food options). \n \nLunches may also be a meal that is skipped. This might be due to a lack of planning, a busy schedule, overconsumption of filling beverages, or the misconception that skipping meals will assist with weight loss. Not eating lunch, however, can lead to fatigue, inadequate intake of important nutrients, a craving for less healthy options and overeating the rest of the day. \n \nPrioritizing a healthy, appropriately-sized lunch can be extremely beneficial. Think of it as a mini brain vacation that will send you into the afternoon with better fuel and increased efficiency. As you decide what to eat, think by food groups and ideally have each represented. Consider writing down possible lunch combos that you might put together when eating out or when packing a lunch. Maybe write these ideas on index cards as a handy reference. \n \nWhen it comes to addressing the potential problems of eating out, there are several actions steps that might be helpful. For people with jobs that include a lot of car travel instead of being at the mercy of eating establishments along the way, consider packing meals and snacks in your car. You can choose to pack less perishable foods or take along a small cooler. \n \nThe same is true if you have a desk job where packing lunch not only puts you in total control of the types and quantities of food you eat for lunch, but can also save you money. \n \nIf packing food is not possible, seek out eating establishments that are more likely to offer healthier foods and where you have the option of smaller portions. Be on the lookout for foods high in sodium, saturated fat, added sugars, or fried foods and limit these. Choose less processed higher fiber foods (whole grain products, fruit, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds) when possible. \n \nWhen a school or work site has a cafeteria, consider which are the healthier offerings. Salad bars may be a good choice for a lunch or side dish, but watch the higher calorie \u201cextras.\u201d Ideally, your salad should include dark leafy greens, lots of colorful vegetables, and a source of healthy protein (grilled chicken, fish, beans, nuts, seeds, eggs, etc.). \n \nIf you have chosen a salad as your lunch entrée, don\u2019t forget to also include a source of whole grain, a starchy vegetable, milk, yogurt, fruit, beans, or other source of healthy carbs as part of the meal. These provide brain and body fuel for the afternoon, especially if you plan to be physically active. Choose an oil-based or lite dressing rather than fat-free if the meal has no other fat source (some nutrients needs a little fat for absorption). \n \nIf you prefer sandwiches at lunch, keep in mind a few guidelines, whether you are purchasing it at a sandwich shop or packing one from home. Choose whole grain bread products \u2013 bread, pita, wrap, roll, bagel, etc. Note that some bread products count as more than one or two servings of grain. For instance, a 4-inch bagel or a whole large pita equals about three to four slices of bread. A 6-inch sub roll and most large wraps count toward about three slices of bread. If the bread item has a label, stick to an amount that provides no more than about 30 grams of carbohydrates (about two grain servings) for the whole sandwich. \n \nFor protein, choose lean meat or poultry items or fish, while limiting processed meats. If you are packing your own lunch, consider cooking some chicken or turkey breasts, cutting them into bite-sized pieces, and portioning these into snack bags. Some can be frozen for later use, and the rest can go in the refrigerator as an add-in for sandwiches, salads, soups, or stir fries. Proteins might also include nut or seed butters, hummus, beans, or eggs. Limit high fat cheeses which contain a lot of saturated fat and calories. \n \nSome sandwiches can hold veggies as well. You could also add a salad, vegetable soup, or some raw veggies on the side. These not only provide a lot of nutrients, but can fill you up on fewer calories, leaving less room for excesses of other sources of calories. \n \nBe careful of the condiments and sandwich spreads you use. Some of the better ones might be assorted mustards, hummus, guacamole, sun dried tomato paste, olive tapenade, horseradish spread, or pesto. \n \nConsider what you could include in your lunch that provides some calcium. It could be a glass of milk or soy milk, a latte, yogurt, cottage cheese, or some low-fat cheese. Some of the milk alternatives are fortified with calcium, but tend to have minimal other nutritional value. \n \nFruit is a great way to add a little bit of sweetness to lunch without the guilt. This might be a grab-and-go piece of fruit, some unsweetened applesauce, a couple of tablespoons of raisins or other dried fruit, a serving of fresh berries, or cut-up fresh fruit. \n \nLeftovers are another possibility for lunch. Keep in mind the proportion of the \u201cMy Plate\u201d image \u2013 half the meal veggies, a quarter of the meal protein, and a quarter some type of healthy starch. One-dish meals work well here \u2013 think soups, chili, stews, stir fry, or cooked whole grain dishes with veggies and a protein source. You can purposefully make larger amounts every time you make dinner so that you have some to use for lunches. \n \nSo with a little preplanning, lunch can be a friend rather than a foe in your quest for better health. \n \nPam Stuppy, MS, RD, CSSD, LD, is a registered, licensed dietitian with nutrition counseling offices in York, Maine, and Portsmouth.

Regarding the MLK Jr. holiday, I am panicked that my mind may be playing tricks on me. After reading \u201cAsk Jerry\u201d for many years, I am optimistic you will settle my concern. Here is the issue.  \n \nEarlier this month, my new senior-citizen neighbors and I were watching the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday observances. There was a fair amount of coverage on television. It mentioned that MLK Jr. Day did not become a holiday until 1983. Unless my mind is totally disappearing from reality, I have a clear recollection that we celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr. Day during the mid-1970s.  \n \nAm I totally losing my memory?  \n \n\u2014 Mary T., Dubuque, Iowa  \n \nDear Mary:  \n \nYour memory sounds excellent to me. When you lived in Galena, Illinois, you happen to reside in the first state to observe Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as an official holiday. It was 1973 when Illinois adopted it as a state holiday.  \n \nFour days after the assassination of The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1968), legislation was introduced to make MLK Jr. Day a federal holiday. However, it took 15 years before legislation was passed (1983). Then, it was another three years before the legislation and MLK Jr. Day were in effect (1986).  \n \nThe holiday was not observed immediately in all 50 states though DC, like Illinois, observed it officially before it became a national holiday. Following a tourist boycott, Arizona approved the holiday in 1992. New Hampshire, the last state to acknowledge Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in its own right, did not adopt the holiday until 1999. It was 13 years after it became a federal holiday that New Hampshire actually changed the name of its Civil Rights Day to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Obviously, this holiday did not happen instantly across the United States.  \n \nEven today, there are three southern states that combine Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Robert E. Lee Day. Those are Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Albeit controversial, that one-stop holiday still exists in those states.  \n \nIn fact, many variations have occurred throughout the country and over the years. For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia merged the commemoration of Robert E. Lee, Thomas J. (\u201cStonewall\u201d) Jackson, and Martin Luther King, Jr. into one holiday. Although the Lee and Jackson portion were subsequently separated from the King portion, Lee-Jackson-King Day was observed annually in Virginia from 1984 through 2000.  \n \nWhile hardly a comprehensive history, that would be a CliffsNotes version of the MLK Jr. holiday. Meanwhile, Mary, I am impressed that you recall events so specifically from the mid-1970s. Congratulations.  \n \nJerry Romansky is a syndicated columnist.

On Thursday's Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the STAR EV Sirius took center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. \n \nAlthough primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry now encompasses a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion. STAR EV kept the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which boasts automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED illuminated dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). \n \nSTAR EV revealed two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a \"tricked-out\" version to show how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be painted a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also offers a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. \n \nWhile the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will expand to include 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic. As all STAR's vehicles, the Sirius is 100% electric with a 4 kW AC motor, 350 A Curtis AC controller, and can travel at a top speed of 19.5 mph. (The LSV version peaks at 25 mph.) The line officially launches in the summer of 2017, available through any of STAR's 250+ authorized dealers nationwide and internationally. \n \nRead the full story at http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14021772.htm \n     PRWeb.com   \nPRWEB.COM Newswire","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Retail industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Radio industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Sirius model from STAR Electric Vehicles makes its debut at PGA Merchandise Show","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"PredictWallStreet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"227529942","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"927"},"name":"PredictWallStreet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.predictwallstreet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14021772.htm"],"sequenceId":"695202352574","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I was mere blocks from where I'd started my walk with Otis, the beagle I was dog-sitting. That knowledge didn't matter, though; fear and adrenaline pulsed through my veins and I began to sweat profusely, which only added to the confusion in my brain. I had no idea where I was, and my surroundings looked completely unfamiliar. It was as though I'd been dropped into the middle of a foreign land. Walking in any direction would be just a guess: Am I getting closer to or farther away from where I need to be? \n \nI hadn't written down the address of the home I was staying at and thus had no way to ask directions, and cellphones and GPS navigation were yet to be invented. Fortunately, a woman who approached to greet Otis knew his owners and their house. She was kind enough to walk me back. We were only four blocks away. \n \nI was 13 when this happened, and although I knew from a much earlier age that I had more trouble than most finding my way, it was easy just to tag along and follow others. However, this experience made me realize there was something wrong with me. My life was forever changed. \n \nWhat if that woman hadn't happened by? Would I have had to knock on someone's door and ask to use their phone to call the police? What would I tell them? How could I expect them to return me to a place if I had no address or description to provide? \n \nI have developmental topographical disorientation, or DTD. This means I can't form a mental map or image of my surroundings. Unlike most people, I have no internal compass. At 61, I still get lost, and it's every bit as confounding and frightening as it was all those years ago. \n \n\"When you move around, you do so by monitoring a lot of information, you look at landmarks and you try not to bump into walls,\" says Giuseppe Iaria, an associate professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Calgary. \"There is all this processing of dynamic information. You use this to form and constantly update a cognitive map of where everything is around you.\" \n \nBrain lesions sometimes affect the orientation process, producing a condition called acquired topographical disorientation. Those of us with DTD, however, show no evidence of brain damage. \n \n\"In other words, there was no brain injury \u2014 no car accident, no brain tumor or stroke,\" says Iaria, who developed the DTD diagnosis and first wrote about it in 2009. \"They just didn't develop certain skills. We have found that these people who have this condition, in which basically they get lost every day in the most familiar surroundings, have been this way all their lives.\" \n \nThe brains of people with DTD function much differently from those of other people, Iaria says. Brain scans of resting DTD patients have shown decreased communication between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortices, both locations vital to spatial orientation. The two don't work in sync with one another, which impairs navigational abilities. Iaria says this condition may affect up to 2 percent of the population. \n \nDTD was brought to light by filmmaker Michelle Coomber in the 2010 documentary \"Lost Every Day,\" about Sharon Roseman of Denver, who was unable to find her way around her own apartment. \n \nRoseman had kept her condition a secret for years after receiving several wrong diagnoses, including multiple personality disorder. She eventually confided in her brother, who was instrumental in her contacting Iaria. She and hundreds of others have since participated in many studies, all of which concluded there had been no stroke or other kind of damage to their brains, memory or intelligence. \n \nI vividly remember having to adapt to my condition once I started driving. I would either follow a friend who was in a car ahead of me or I would ride as a passenger to parties and other functions. I was terrified if there was no one to accompany me when driving, even if only to the store a mile and a half away. Often, I wouldn't return for hours. \n \nI don't know whether I've spent more time hopelessly lost within miles of my home or trying to explain to people why I cannot follow a simple set of directions. They cannot understand how it's possible to be completely and utterly lost. \"How can you not know where you are? Don't you recognize landmarks? Don't you pay attention while you're driving? Can't you read a map?\" \n \nWhile everyone experiences being lost at times, that is significantly different from being completely disoriented in what should be very familiar surroundings. I have spent countless hours on backcountry roads not having any idea where I was; in one case, I didn't even know which state I was in. \n \nIn a hurry to contend with an emergency in Virginia, I left my home in Frederick, Maryland, at 10 p.m., heading for Alexandria, about 60 miles away. After seven long hours and with barely a drop of gas left, I began panicking, fearing I might find myself stranded on the side of the road at the mercy of whoever might stop. I found a gas station at dawn. I pulled in and had to ask what state I was in. I was in Elkins, West Virginia, nearly 200 miles west of my home and far from Alexandria. I nodded politely as I grasped the dirty receipt on which the attendant had scribbled directions to presumably get me back on track. They meant nothing. I can't follow a map or written directions. In the light of day, I managed to find my way back to the interstate, and my son met me at a rest stop near my destination to ensure I arrived safely. \n \nI factor in \"lost time\" when calculating the minutes or hours needed to reach my destination, and even now with GPS devices, I'm not secure that I'll find my way. I lose my satellite signal often and, with it, my feeling of security. Now, before I leave home, I always write down the address of my destination in case something happens to my phone and/or my GPS tool, and I always let someone know where I am going. \n \nFriends and acquaintances often laugh politely when I hesitate to meet somewhere because I may get lost. \"It's right down the road! You can't miss it: That big red house is right on the corner!\" Actually, with DTD, adding landmarks to an already confusing route makes matters only further confounding. \n \nI now offer an analogy when pressed to explain my problem: It's comparable to asking a blind person to see the color yellow. \"It's right in front of you, you can't miss it: It's bright golden yellow!\" Society readily accept blindness and understands its principles: A person cannot see no matter how bright the color. But because so little is known about DTD and because most of the population can easily navigate with their inner cognitive map, there's an \"idiot\" stigma attached to it. Those of us struggling with this disorder are often left with feelings of anxiety, depression, isolation and self-doubt, so we keep our condition to ourselves. \n \nMy children are grown young men now, and they're very patient and understanding. They fully comprehend the serious nature and complexities of my disorder and the dangers associated with it. They don't take it lightly, and they have me check in frequently when I am traveling. \n \nThere is no cure for DTD, but research is ongoing. I share my story in hopes of reaching others with DTD, especially those who have it but are unaware there's a diagnosis. I find comfort that there is a medical term and diagnosis for my condition and that it's the focus of much-needed research. With awareness, we can break free from feelings of isolation, anxiety, self-doubt and depression. \n \nFor now, I will continue to navigate the roads much the same way I navigate life: Keep it simple and straightforward, and always have a backup plan","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mary McLaurine Speical to The Washington Post"},"topics":[],"title":"Rare neurological disorder prevents people from knowing where they are","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202354381","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He doesn\u2019t represent the aristocracy.\u201d \n \nAnd he had fun along the way, inviting all of us to join him. Chrome has his own Facebook page. So do his fans. He also has a Twitter account. He has been sponsored by, among others, Breathe Right and Skechers. \n \n \nThis horse is so popular that it\u2019s almost as if people could line up for a turn to ride him, not unlike kids running the bases after an Angels game. \n \nAt this track, a ritual developed over the past three years that saw fans congregating in the early morning chill and darkness just for the chance to watch Chrome go through the most basic of workouts. \n \n\u201cThe world is holding onto Chrome,\u201d said Dr. Don Moore, a San Clemente chiropractor who works on the horse. \u201cHe is that Seabiscuit, that Secretariat. Everybody\u2019s just grabbing on. The country is circling around him.\u201d \n \nChrome made a celebrity out of Art Sherman, the now 79-year-old trainer who previously was a journeyman in this game. \n \nSherman, in fact, had to work part-time as a mutuel clerk during some of his barn\u2019s more desperate times. \n \nNow, everyone knows the trainer and the stories, like the one of how Sherman would rise most mornings at 4:45, drive to his barn here, walk over to Chrome\u2019s stall and feed him a cookie. \n \nOn Sherman\u2019s cell phone, he has pictures of his star doing everything from racing to lounging. He also has photos of Chrome awesomely rearing on his hind legs during otherwise simple trips to the track for training. \n \n\u201cHe can get wound up,\u201d Sherman explained recently. \u201cWhen he does, he\u2019s a lot of horse. That\u2019s just him feeling good out there. He\u2019s a stallion. He has other things on his mind sometimes.\u201d \n \nRacing, however, apparently never fades too far away for Chrome. Sherman\u2019s son and assistant, Alan, has the \u201cCall to Post\u201d bugle blast on his phone. Every time it\u2019s played, Chrome genuinely comes to attention. \n \nBut it\u2019s on to his second career now, Chrome scheduled to ship from Florida to the breeding shed at Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky. \n \nThe breeders last week posted photos on Twitter of the brass plate that will mark Chrome\u2019s new home. \n \nMeanwhile, his double-wide stall at Los Alamitos is now being occupied by Grade I winner Dortmund, who lost three times to Chrome in 2016 and a month ago was transferred to Sherman\u2019s barn. \n \n\u201cChrome has a big second career coming up,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a lot of good mares to mess around with. I just hope I\u2019m around to train some of his babies.\u201d \n \nImmediately after the race Saturday, not much was said among our group at Los Al. Most of the people walked away in silence.

There is nothing \u201cjunior\u201d or \u201clightweight\u201d about them. \n \nThe most interesting division in boxing hit another gear Saturday night at Fantasy Springs Casino. \n \nFrancisco Vargas, who had gotten a win and a draw in the 2015 and 2016 Fights of the Year, ran up against Miguel Berchelt, a fellow Mexican who was 30-1 but nobody\u2019s household name in America. \n \nAnd it seems Vargas has paid a high price for providing such violent entertainment. \n \nHis usual punching volume removed none of the spring in Berchelt\u2019s step. Neither did it stop his opponent\u2019s forward surges. \n \nWhen Berchelt powered Vargas against the ropes near the end of the 11th round and got little shrapnel in return, referee Raul Caiz Jr. stopped it at the 2:19 mark. \n \nBerchelt thus became the new WBC 130-pound champion and an intriguing new figure for the networks. \n \nFrom the beginning Vargas had difficulty coping with Berchelt\u2019s one-inch reach advantage and his two-handed power. Unlike Vargas\u2019 earlier victims, Berchelt was able to judge the distance and keep Vargas from rat-a-tat inside attacks. There was nothing resembling a knockdown, but Berchelt also held his poise and his command throughout. Between the ninth and 10th rounds, ring doctors spent a long time staring at Vargas\u2019 ravaged eye. Berchelt, standing and waiting to come in, began holding up his fist in anticipatory victory. The fight resumed, but nothing changed. \n \nIt was a surprising leap for a guy who never had fought for a title before and, in fact, never had seen a seventh round. \n \n\u201cVargas is a great champion, that\u2019s why he\u2019s had those Fights of the Year,\u201d Berchelt said later. \u201cI\u2019m young, I\u2019m hungry and I came here to be the world champion, and right now that feels great.\u201d \n \nThe outcome was not exactly a revelation for Vargas and his Golden Boy handlers. \n \n\u201cHe is his own worst enemy,\u201d said Eric Gomez, Oscar De La Hoya\u2019s right-hand man at Golden Boy. \u201cHe has a lot of skills as a boxer and a puncher, but he wants to fight these wars.\u201d \n \nGomez had likened Vargas to Salvador Sanchez, the great featherweight champ of the early 80s who died in a car wreck when he was only 23 and ready to become a celestial figure in the sport. Sanchez had the same charisma, in and out of the ring, but he also had the counterpunching polish necessary to put the head-first guys in their place. \n \nThat storyline vanished Saturday night, but another door opens and another compelling super-featherweight comes out. \n \nIf you could somehow clear out the politics (ha), you\u2019d see a procession of quality 130-pound matchups on a monthly basis. \n \n \nNobody in boxing is more polished and confident than Vasyl Lomachenko, and yet he lost his first professional fight to Orlando Salido, who brawled Varga to a draw at StubHub Center last June in what was the 2016 Fight of the Year. Then there\u2019s Gervonta Davis, the kid from Baltimore who dethroned Jose Pedraza earlier this month. \n \nThe only division on the same level is the 126-pound featherweight division, with Carl Frampton, Leo Santa Cruz, Oscar Valdez, Abner Mares and Lee Selby, among others. But several of those fellows will inevitably move up to 130, creating more permutations. \n \nIn the lead-in fight, Takashi Miura of Japan illustrated how stout Vargas is. The man who lost his 130-pound championship to Vargas in November of 2015 took consistent punishment from Miguel Roman, but kept moving forward until he had decked Roman three times and finished him in the 12th round. \n \nMiura, a southpaw who apparently has no nerve endings or anything resembling a pitch count, kept stalking Roman no matter how many fists he got in return. In the seventh round, Roman even knocked out Miura\u2019s mouthpiece. But a wicked left to the body sent Roman to the floor in the 9th round, and from there it was just a survival game. \n \nMiura thus raised his record to 31-3-2. He had only fought one round since he and Vargas staged the Fight of the Year two years ago, in which Miura nearly closed Vargas\u2019 eye and had the doctors wondering if the fight should be stopped. Then Vargas put that aside and knocked out Miura in Round 9. \n \nMaybe we\u2019ll see Miura-Berchelt, or Lomachenko-Salido, or Vargas against somebody a little less dangerous before he returns to championship mode. With his face an angry cherry pie, Vargas stood on the turnbuckle and waved goodbye. He\u2019ll be back, but the non-junior, non-lightweights won\u2019t waste time waiting.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: boxing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Boxer Miguel Berchelt becomes newest champ with confident TKO","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91106","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pasadena","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pasadena Star News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169702758","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Pasadena Star News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pasadenastarnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202355409","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Milwaukee news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harrison","zipCode":"39507","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gulfport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6447"},"name":"Sun Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sunherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202356770","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It suggests that tomorrow\u2019s buildings will or should be constructed of wood. \n\nThe exhibition, \u201cTimber City,\u201d highlights the wide range of benefits offered by cutting-edge methods of timber construction, showing that wood is a modern, strong and versatile material. \n\nWinners of Tall Wood Building Prize \n\nThe show highlights the two winners of the Tall Wood Building Prize, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  \n\n\u201cOne in New York City and one in Portland, Oregon, are two premier cross-laminated (engineered, pre-fabricated) timber buildings going up right now,\u201d said the exhibition\u2019s curator, Susan Piedmont-Palladino. \u201cThey\u2019re similar structures. Both buildings are using this material ... in slightly different ways, but the goal is to build right in the middle of the city.\u201d \n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes timber the perfect choice in a busy district like New York\u2019s Manhattan, where construction speed and efficiency are vital. \n\n\u201cBuildings go up very quickly. The materials for the building \u2014 the walls and the floors and the ceilings \u2014 are manufactured off-site. They come on a truck, pre-fabricated,\u201d Piedmont-Palladino said. \u201cSo a work crew armed with power screwdrivers can basically assemble the building extremely quickly. There\u2019s no long-term curing of concrete\u201d needed. \n\nInformation panels in the exhibition explain that concrete manufacturing is the world\u2019s third-largest source of greenhouse gases, and that harvesting timber \u2014 a renewable resource \u2014 has a lower environmental cost than mining the materials needed to make steel and concrete. \n\nNew manufacturing techniques make cross-laminated timber stronger. Piedmont-Palladino compares it to giant sheets of plywood, placing her hands at 90 degrees on top of each other to demonstrate how it\u2019s made. \n\n\u201cSo it is layered, one layer this way, another layer that way, another layer that way, and that way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we called dimensionally stable. It doesn\u2019t move around. And it can be manufactured from small trees that otherwise have very little economic value.\u201d \n\nFire-resistant wood \n\nThe curator also says layered timber resists fire better than unprotected steel, which weakens faster than wood when heated. A recently constructed fire station in Oregon, covered with blackened wood from a local flame-damaged barn, demonstrates how a charred exterior actually protects wood from fire. \n\nIn addition, Piedmont-Palladino pointed to a psychological benefit of wood construction.  \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this concept of biophilia, that is the theory that we are attracted to and relaxed by, and in general our mental and physical health is improved by, being in proximate condition to nature or the elements from nature,\u201d she said. \n\nTimber may not be the best building material in every situation, but the National Building Museum predicts that soon there will be a lot more wooden buildings around the world. \n\nThe National Building Museum\u2019s \u201cTimber City\u201d exhibition runs through September 10, 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Museum Exhibit Challenges Notion That Wood Is an Antiquated Building Material ","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"XYZNews.com.ng","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609069359","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"XYZNews.com.ng","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://xyznews.com.ng"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202358295","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Kent","zipCode":"02818","state":"Rhode Island","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"East Greenwich","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coventry Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172081088","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Coventry Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coventry.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695202365603","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(More about that in a minute.) \n \nAs I strolled the cobblestone streets of Carcassonne in southern France \u2014Europe's largest double-walled fortified medieval city, with 4 million annual visitors \u2014 I expected a knight in shining armor to gallop by on his horse any second, perhaps to rescue a damsel in distress (or maybe a tired tourist!). \n \nThis was my second visit here, and I've always been fascinated by its history. Spread over almost two miles of ramparts atop a cliff in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, the stunning \"Cite\" of Carcassonne \u2014 creatively built over the centuries to withstand invasions, with 52 towers, gatehouses and turrets \u2014 includes the 11th-13th century Viscount's Castle, 13th-17th century Inquisition House (where heretics were punished) and the fascinating Basilica of St. Nazaire (blessed by Pope Urban II in 1096). The large fortress overlooks the River Aude, which separates it from the \"modern\" town below of 46,000, built in the mid-13th century by St. Louis (Louis IX). \n \nThe popular tourist site of walled Carcassonne \"is a fairy-tale setting,\" observed Jan Percival Lipscomb of San Diego, Calif. \"It's like Cinderella's castle at Disneyland, except for real.\" \n \nBut, acknowledged Lipscomb, as she walked around on a cold, windy day: \"I can also sense the darker side \u2014 the invasions, battles, suffering and prayers of the townspeople who had begged those walls to protect them.\" \n \nNamed a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, Carcassonne \u2014 known to be a human settlement as far back as 600 B.C.\u2014 encompasses more than 2,000 years of nature, art, architecture and history in its strategic Languedoc location, on a historic corridor between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and a gateway to the Pyrenees. The Romans were here in the second century B.C. (naming it Carcaso); following that, the Visigoths, Saracens, Franks, feudal lords, Seneschals, Trencavels and various kings of France were among those who put their mark here throughout the centuries \u2014 some peacefully, some tragically brutal. \n \nIt was in this region, for example, at the end of the 11th century, that the Cathars (named from the Greek word \"Katharos,\" meaning \"pure\"), disenchanted with the Roman Catholic Church \u2014 feeling that it was run by a greedy and corrupt clergy \u2014 formed their own version of Christianity. They believed there had been two creations \u2014one good, the other evil \u2014 and they considered themselves to be the \"good Christians,\" the true church of God. \n \nThe Cathars, who were vegetarian, had a single prayer, the Lord's Prayer, and were baptized but did not partake in communion or use the cross as their symbol. They were led by bishops called parfaits. By the early 13th century the Cathars were viewed as dangerous heretics, and in 1209 Pope Innocent III decreed that all of them be killed. The bloody Albigensian Crusade, led by Simon de Montfort, turned this area into a killing ground. In 1247, the Cite came under the rule of the king when Louis IX founded the newer city across the river below. The outer ramparts constructed during his reign were continued under his son, Philip III; Carcassonne became so strongly fortified that it even stopped Edward, the Black Prince, in 1355. \n \nToday, as visitors wander through the peaceful, charming walled city \u2014 which is still inhabited by some 100 townsfolk, mostly craftsmen and shopkeepers who sell local food items, wines, candies and crafts \u2014 it's hard to believe that in the early 19th century it was almost torn down. \n \nOr that a pig once reportedly \"saved\" it! \n \nIt was in the late eighth century, during the five-year siege when Charlemagne was determined to starve the residents of Carcassonne, driving out the Moors and Saracens. After nearly the entire garrison had died of hunger, legend has it that Lady Carcas, the wife of the Saracen King Balaak, made some dummies that she arranged all along the ramparts to make it look as if they were still fortified. She then heroically shot arrows at the enemy below \u2014 and had the only pig left devour all the remaining grain. When it was stuffed, she tossed it over, and when it hit the ground its belly ripped open, exposing the undigested grain. Upon seeing that, Charlemagne gave up, thinking that the residents were doing quite well and could not be beat. He decided to lift the siege and turned to leave. Lady Carcas, thrilled at defeating him by such a clever ruse, sounded the trumpets to call him back. But he didn't hear them. His esquire, who did, reportedly said to him: \"Sire, Carcas te sonne (Carcas is calling you).\" This is supposedly how the town got its name. \n \nToday, a statue of Lady Carcas stands in front of the drawbridge, But perhaps there should be one of the poor pig! \n \nFollowing the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, which ended Carcassonne's reign as a strategic area, the city went downhill. By the beginning of the 18th century houses \u2014 and hovels \u2014 were built between the walls, with residents using materials they tore down from the fortification. \n \n\"That was the beginning of the destruction of Carcassonne,\" said my tour guide as we strolled around on a chilly, rainy day. Eventually the walled city was condemned for demolition. But in 1850 it was saved by the passion and perseverance of historian and archaeologist Jean-Pierre Cros-Mayrevieille and Inspector General of Historical Monuments Prosper Merimee, who pleaded with the French government to preserve the historic fortress. \n \nAfter a massive undertaking, it was subsequently restored by renowned 19th-century French Gothic architect and writer Eugene Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, who once said of Carcassonne, \"I doubt that there exists anywhere in Europe as complete and formidable a system of defense of the sixth, 12th and 13th centuries, as interesting a subject of study and a more picturesque situation.\" \n \nAnd today this unique, historic fortified city remains a testament to his vision. \n \nWHEN YOU GO \n \nInstead of flying or driving here from Paris, I took the train (including the high-speed TGV, via Nimes and Montpellier); it's about a five-hour ride: www.raileurope.com. \n \nYou must sample the region's Cassoulet \u2014 a hearty stew of duck, goose or pork with sausage and white beans \u2014 and the Confit au Canard; I dined at the excellent restaurant Comte Roger. \n \nThe five-star Hotel de la Cite \u2014 built within the walled city on the site of the former 13th-century bishop's palace \u2014 opened in 1909: www.hoteldelacite.com. \n \nI stayed just outside the walled city at the family-owned Le Domaine d' Auriac, a historic, romantic 24-room, five-star chateau with two restaurants featuring local cuisine: www.domaine-d-auriac.com. \n \nBest months to visit are May, June, September or October for nice weather (and fewer crowds). And for the popular Festival de Carcassonne in July: www.festivaldecarcassonne.fr/en/festival. \n \nFor more information (click on English versions): www.carcassonne-tourisme.com and www.carcassonne.culture.fr \n \nAnd please see www.franceguide.com. \n  \nTourists visit the walled French city of Carcassonne, Europe's largest fortified medieval city, with 4 million annual visitors and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

But never had she had a weekend quite like the last one. \n \nKaren Chen, a 17-year-old, 4-foot-11 sprite from Fremont who trains under Gambill at Riverside Icetown, stunned the figure skating community by swiping the Ladies Senior gold at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas City. \n \nThe next night, Vincent Zhou, a 16-year-old from Palo Alto via Icetown who won the national junior title three years ago as a 13-year-old, finished second in the Men\u2019s Senior competition to Nathan Chen, no relation to Karen. \n \nOne more level crossed off. It may have been just a matter of time. \n \n\u201cIt is a building process,\u201d said Gambill. \u201cI guess that just means we\u2019re on the right track. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because now I\u2019ve had every national champion: Juvenile boy and girl, intermediate boy and girl, novice boy and girl, junior boy and girl, and now senior girl. Karen is my first senior champion, so that makes it special, that elusive senior title. And Vincent was very close.\u201d \n \nWhich would make her, um, an overnight success? \n \n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m an up-and-coming coach.\u201d \n \nGambill, a Redlands resident who declined to state her age but acknowledged her skaters now give her anniversary cards on her birthday \u2014 anniversaries of turning 39, get it? \u2014 grew up in the Sacramento area and was a good enough skater at 14 to leave home to train, much as her pupils now do. \n \nShe began coaching in Stockton 30 years ago. \n \n\u201cThe Oak Park Ice Arena,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I moved down to Southern California, and had two kids and started coaching down here. My son (Matt) is now 27, so it was 27 years ago that I started down here.\u201d \n \nHer first teaching gig in Southern California was in Palm Desert, at a long, skinny rink in the middle of the Town Center Mall \u2014 \u201ccalled a hot dog rink,\u201d she recalled. Her pupils there included Yorba Linda\u2019s Sandy Rucker and Indio\u2019s Dennis Phan; both went on to win age group national championships, Phan in 2003 and Rucker in 2005. \n \nShe later began commuting from Redlands to Anaheim three times a week to teach on a bigger ice surface, and also used the Ice Castle international training center in Lake Arrowhead when it was still open. \n \n \nAnd then Icetown opened, in 1997, an easier commute with no need to navigate mountain roads. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. \n \nThe accolades have accumulated over the years. Gambill was named the USOC Developmental Coach of the Year in 2005 \u2014 an honor that encompasses all sports \u2014 and has been similarly honored by U.S. Figure Skating and the Professional Skaters Association in 2005, 2012 and 2013. \n \nBut it\u2019s about her pupils, as it should be. She has coached world or national medalists Richard Dornbush, Shotaro Omori, Tyler Pierce and Caroline Zhang. \n \nFour of her skaters will be competing at either the world championships or world junior championships this year. Chen and Brendan Kerry of Australia will compete in the 2017 World Championships March 29-April 2 in Helsinki, Finland (and both will also compete in the Four Continents competition Feb. 15 in Gangneung, Korea, the site of next year\u2019s Olympic competition). \n \nMeanwhile, Zhou and Yarrick Paniot of the Ukraine will compete in the World Junior Championships beginning March 15 in Tapiei City, Taiwan. Zhou will also be the first alternate for the U.S. at the Worlds should there be an injury. \n \n\u201cI like it when they come in young and I can build them back up again,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun to get some of the older ones. Yaro (Paniot) just came in a couple of weeks ago. He\u2019s super talented, so I\u2019m very excited to see what I can do with him as well.\u201d \n \nShe has around 20 skaters total, and her preference is to have everyone on the ice together. She barks orders \u2014 her own description \u2014 and, along with assistant coach Ryan Berning, gives technical guidance. She doesn\u2019t discourage the idea among her skaters that she has eyes in the back of her head, a fiction that works as long as she can see their reflections in the Plexiglas. \n \nAnd she listens as well as instructs. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with her for three years now, and I feel like I really do love her as a coach,\u201d Chen said. \u201cShe can be strict, but she\u2019s definitely very understanding as well. She listens to my opinion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s always been something I struggled with in my interaction with my coach, but I feel like I\u2019m getting better. Sometimes if I\u2019m having a bad day or my knee\u2019s bothering me or something, it\u2019s hard for me to speak up and tell her, because I feel like I want to give my 100 percent in training and I don\u2019t want to let this affect anything ... (but) she\u2019s let me know this: It\u2019s important that if I\u2019m not feeling 100 percent today I need to let her know, so she can make adjustments to my training and it\u2019ll be beneficial for us both.\u201d \n \nChen is one of many skaters who have relocated from elsewhere specifically to train under Gambill. Her mother, Hsiu-Hui Tseng, is with her and her younger brother Jeffrey, an ice dancer, in Southern California during the week while her husband, Chih-Hsiu Chen, has stayed in the Bay Area. \n \n\u201cI like the way she teaches kids,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cSometimes you need to be strict. (But) she\u2019s a coach you can communicate with. Some coaches won\u2019t communicate with parents, but she\u2019s willing to listen.\u201d \n \nWith more success, inevitably Gambill will field more calls from parents inquiring whether there is space for their prodigies. For the good ones, there will assuredly be room. \n \n\u201cWhen I first started coaching I taught a little girl whose father was a farmer,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd he made a statement to me that \u2018when my crop is great, I\u2019m the smartest farmer in the world. But when I have a bad crop, due to whatever reason, all of a sudden I\u2019m a very stupid farmer.\u2019 \n \n\u201cIt all depends on the crop you have at the time.\u201d \n \nOf course, how well you cultivate it matters, too.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Jim Alexander: Tammy Gambill\u2019s coaching leaves nothing to chance","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91106","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pasadena","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pasadena Star News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169702758","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Pasadena Star News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pasadenastarnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202367932","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There hasn't been a single customer since December, when neighbouring Nigeria banned car imports by land as part of a wave of protectionist policies that are strangling Benin's economy.\n\n\"We spend our days smoking, it's our life now,\" Hijazi sighs, sitting in a gazebo beside his stock of thousands of cars steadily accumulating the dry winter dust.\n\nThis afternoon, Hijazi -- who, like the vast majority of car dealers in Benin, is Lebanese -- called in his Beninese accountant to help close up shop.\n\nDebts are accumulating and the stress is becoming too much. \"I lost in one year what I have earned in 16,\" Ali Assi, another car dealer, told AFP.\n\nREAD: Nigeria crowns new king of Benin\n\nOf the 2,500 Lebanese dealers in Cotonou, 1,600 have packed up and left in the last six months, shutting down businesses that employed dozens of drivers, cleaners and security staff.\n\n\"Unemployed people used to come here to find work,\" said Vincent Gouton, who represents a group of car dealership managers in Cotonou.\n\nThe Benin car market began its free fall last year when neighbouring Nigeria entered its first recession since 1994.\n\nNigeria, an economic behemoth of 190 million people, gobbles up \"99 percent of car exports\" in Benin, according to Gouton.\n\nBenin, a tiny country with scarce natural resources, relies on its port business to survive.\n\nFrom the port city of Cotonou, imported cars, fabrics, and food from all over the world get distributed across west Africa.\n\nBut since the Nigerian economy crashed following the collapse in global oil prices, Benin has been suffering knock-on effects.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's protectionist policies -- his government has banned a slew of items including cars imported by land -- has only aggravated the situation. \n\n'Encourage smuggling'\n\n\"This decision will encourage smuggling, it's back to square one,\" Gouton said.\n\nSeveral agreements were signed in the past between Benin and Nigeria to facilitate legal trade.\n\nBut Nigeria accuses Beninese customs of failing to monitor the exported goods and collect taxes.\n\nBuhari hopes that closing land borders will revitalise Nigerian industries and attract business to the port at Lagos, Nigeria's economic capital and largest city.\n\nToday more than 20 products -- the list has never been officially published -- are banned from being imported overland.\n\n\"For the past 18 months, we have seen a lot of policies that are not market friendly\", said Nigerian economist Nonso Obikili. \"The self-sufficiency policy has led the government to create all sorts of hostile environments around import.\n\n\"The government wants to ban palm oil (imports) but our plantations are not ready to meet local demand, and it takes two years to get oil from trees. It's a mess.\n\n\"And this will encourage illegal trade,\" Obikili said.\n\n- 'Killing business' -\n\nIt isn't just Benin that is hurting.\n\nNigerian car dealer Olabanji Akinola said he had had to fire half of his employees last week as a result of the ban.\n\nBusiness used to be brisk at Akinola's car dealership, located on the outskirts of Lagos.\n\nYet now he can't pay any wages. \"In Cotonou, they tax 35 percent of the value of an imported car. In Lagos, it's 70 percent\", Akinola said. \"It's killing the business.\"\n\n\"The price of cars will go up and the smuggling will increase. There are 200 roads through the bush to come to Nigeria, the borders are porous,\" Akinola said.\n\n\"This morning, customers begged me on my knees to lower my prices, but I cannot.\"\n\nUltimately, it may be only the Nigerian government that benefits from the import ban.\n\nIn 2016, customs seized 307 contraband vehicles, worth nearly 5 billion naira (about 15 million euros). The figure is expected to rise in 2017.\n\nAFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Automotive industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Benin news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Benin hit by neighbouring Nigeria's car import ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ENCA","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353328599","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2736"},"name":"ENCA","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.enca.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202371118","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.enca.com/encadrupal/styles/600_383/s3/000_KR286.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It also prompted concern from Australian MPs from both sides, especially over how the order might affect Australian dual nationals. \n \nMr Turnbull's office declined to comment on the 25-minute phone call with Mr Trump. Fairfax Media has been told the President confirmed his administration would honour last year's agreement, though it remains unclear how many of the roughly 2000 asylum-seekers held on Nauru and Manus Island will be resettled in the US. \n Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Australia Day.  Photo: Rohan Thomson  \nUnder the Obama deal, final details, including the number to be resettled, were not expected to be nailed down until the second half of this year, after US officials scrutinised applications and carried out security checks. \n \nBut news that Mr Trump won't overturn his predecessor's arrangement with Australia means the plight of many refugees who have languished on the Pacific islands for years may finally end. \n  \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten welcomed the news, saying: \"I'm pleased if the Americans honour their side of the bargain.\" \n \nMr Trump's executive order includes a four-month pause on all refugee arrivals, a three-month ban on entry by citizens from seven countries of terrorism concern \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia \u2013 and an indefinite halt on all refugees from Syria. \n \nIt also prioritises refugees who are fleeing persecution as members of religious minorities in their home countries, most obviously Christians and other non-Muslims in the Middle East and South Asia. \n \nTravellers with US visas and even residency permits were reportedly detained at American airports or prevented from boarding US-bound planes, but Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said her department had received no requests for help from \"Australians unable to board transport to the United States\". \n \n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals,\" she said. \n \nWhen asked about US legal residents who were visiting Australia and might have difficulty returning, a spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said: \"Anyone who is concerned their visa may expire before their return to the US should make contact with the department. The department will assess any applications for further stay based on the merits of the case and in line with the relevant visa criteria.\" \n \nNeither Ms Bishop nor Mr Turnbull echoed the views of British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said through her spokesman that \"we do not agree with\" the approach taken by Mr Trump on immigration. \n \nBut Australian MPs expressed concern, including Trade Minister Steven Ciobo, who told Sky News: \"That's not the position that I support \u2026 it's not a position that most Australians would support.\" \n \nLabor MP Anne Aly, the first Muslim woman in the Australian Parliament and a counter-terrorism expert, said the countries targeted by Mr Trump were not the major exporters of foreign fighters and therefore it made little sense as a security measure. \n \nShe said it wasn't a Muslim ban because it would affect many minorities from those countries. Rather it was a \"bullshit, conman, snake oil salesman way of trying to make good on his promise of banning Muslims\". \n \nLiberal MP and former human rights commissioner Tim Wilson said that \"so long as people pass security, health and identity assessments, people should be accepted based on the legitimacy of their claim to be a refugee\". \n \nLiberal MPs Jason Falinski and Trent Zimmerman said Mr Trump's approach was not one that Australia should follow. \n \nLabor frontbencher Andrew Giles said he was \"so concerned \u2026 about the utterances of President Trump because they do seem to be a threat to a rules-based international order\".","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Wroe"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Pacific Islands news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Donald Trump tells Malcolm Turnbull he will honour deal to resettle refugees from Nauru and Manus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202373504","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When focusing their learning on what has gone before, how do we know that we are teaching them the right things for what comes next?\"\n\nThe focus, according to Mr Caller, may be better applied to a child's individual talents and skills, using creativity and adapting to advancements in technology and new information as they happen. \n\nMr Caller said: \"In private tutoring, we see time after time how focusing on a child's individual interests and talents, and adapting teaching styles and lesson planning to compliment them, results in a child who is more interested and eager to learn. Tutors International is now seeing clients who are already starting to look for 'outside the box' thinkers when selecting their private tutors [2]. They want someone who can expose their child to a wide range of topics, concepts and ideas from an early age, and use new advancements in technology to their learning advantage. They want someone who can 'move with the times', and this paves the way for some very exciting job opportunities for forward thinking tutors, worldwide.\"\n\nWith a career in education spanning over 25 years, Mr Caller believes that embracing these latest developments and incorporating them into a child's own individual curriculum, while prioritising their creativity and nurturing a natural curiosity, is key in shaping adults that can use their own skills to adapt and succeed in a world that their teachers may never get to experience. \n\nTutors International places exceptional tutors with families based on their individual needs and circumstances.

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KansasCity.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657780","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"362"},"name":"KansasCity.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansascity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202376926","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker.

That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Milwaukee news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Johnston","zipCode":"27577","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Smithfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Raleigh News & Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658506","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2271"},"name":"Raleigh News & Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202385416","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Johnston","zipCode":"27577","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Smithfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Raleigh News & Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658506","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2271"},"name":"Raleigh News & Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202385687","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long. \n \nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports. \n \nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader. \n \nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion. \n \nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups. \n \nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism. \n \n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk City","zipCode":"23510","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Norfolk","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"PilotOnline","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"566885111","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"PilotOnline","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pilotonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202390775","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/pilotonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/c1/bc1f85e0-d8a2-5cd8-8fc7-f508731a87ee/588d9a0245753.image.jpg?resize=300%2C196"}],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pierce","zipCode":"98405","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tacoma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tacoma News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661174","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3846"},"name":"Tacoma News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thenewstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202392638","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker.

However, when asked about Trump's plans for \"extreme vetting\", Marsudi said in social media message sent to Reuters: \"We have deep regrets about the policy.\" \n  \nIn December 2015, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. The idea drew fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution and later evolved into a proposal for \"extreme vetting\". \n  \nMost of Indonesia's 220 million Muslims practise a moderate form of Islam, although the country has some vocal Islamist groups and has suffered in the past from attacks by militants. \n  \nIndonesia has close relations with the United States and many of its citizens think highly of former U.S. President Barack Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Jakarta. \n  \nIndonesian President Joko Widodo said after Trump's inauguration he was optimistic that relations between the countries would strengthen, to the benefit of both. \n  \nForeign Minister Marsudi said Indonesians seeking visas to go the United States had not faced any problems so far. She said there were \"hundreds of thousands\" of Indonesians in the United States. \n  \nA statement on the website of the Indonesian embassy in Washington ( bit.ly/2kdBJs1 ) urged its citizens in the United States to stay calm, but keep vigilant. \n  \nIt said Indonesian citizens should respect U.S. laws and help ensure public order in their neighbourhoods, but also that they should understand their rights in case of any issues and directed them to the website of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). (www.aclu.org). \n  \nThe ACLU sought and won a temporary stay on Trump's order to restrict travellers with passports from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n  \nTrump told reporters in the White House's Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n  \n(Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Paul Tait) \n  Next In World News     Trump bars door to refugees, visitors from seven mainly Muslim nations  \nWASHINGTON/CAIRO Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. \n    In Turkey visit, May pushes trade, mentions human rights  \nANKARA British Prime Minister Theresa May signed a $125 million (£100 million) fighter jet deal with Turkey on Saturday and briefly cautioned Ankara on human rights following last year's failed coup, in a visit squarely aimed at boosting trade between the NATO allies. \n    Israeli troops kill Palestinian in West Bank clash - officials  \nJERUSALEM Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian during a clash on Sunday in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian medical officials.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Agustinus Beo Da Costa"},"topics":[{"name":"Indonesia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Palestinian territories news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Southeast Asia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"UPDATE 1-Muslim-majority Indonesia deeply regrets U.S. immigrant vetting plans","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Reuters UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587711","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Reuters UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Materials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.reuters.com/","publisher":"Thomson Reuters"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2kdBJs1"],"sequenceId":"695202393431","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Cauliflower-based pizza dough. Chocolate-covered quinoa. Bagel balls stuffed with flavored cream cheese. Vegan, paleo, dairy-free frozen dessert that is a bit hard to describe other than to say it is not ice cream. \n  \nElyse Oleksak, a co-founder of Bantam Bagels, hands out samples of her mini-stuffed bagels at the Winter Fancy Food Show in San Francisco, earlier thi... \n  \nNothing says American ingenuity like the eager food entrepreneurs who think their scrumptious concoctions can make it in a culinary landscape that favors big corporations. Last week, 1,400 exhibitors set up shop at the Winter Fancy Food Show in the cavernous Moscone Center here, including some mom-and-pop operations determined to defy the odds. \n \n\"It's possible we do fail,\" said Rachel Geicke, 25, who was there with her business partner, Mariana Ferreira, 23, peddling their non-ice-cream, Snow Monkey. The product, which comes in two flavors, cacao and goji berry, came to market eight weeks ago -- with vast ambitions. \n \nSnow Monkey \"is a vehicle to spark change,\" said Geicke, who met Ferreira when they were undergraduates at Boston University. They describe their fruit-based creation as a \"superfood ice treat, ice cream so good you can have it for breakfast.\" \n \nAs they spooned out samples of Snow Monkey last weekend, one fan jumped and fist-pumped her approval. Now, they only need 100,000 more customers like her. \n \n\"The conventional wisdom would be that up to 90 percent of new packaged food products fail,\" said David Sprinkle, research director of MarketResearch.com and publisher of Packaged Facts . For established brands, he said, the rate is much lower. \n \nIn one part of the convention center, crowds were clotting at the Bantam Bagels booth, where the husband-and-wife team of Nick and Elyse Oleksak were handing out their ping-pong-ball-size toasted bagel balls. The flavors include cinnamon bun, French toast and classic onion. \n \nTheir bagels have that all-important ingredient: authenticity. They are made in Brooklyn with New York water. We \"are trying to be the authentic New York bagel in a different way,\" as Nick Oleksak put it. \n \nBefore they were bagel mavens, Elyse worked in asset management at Morgan Stanley, and Nick was a credit broker for GFI Group, which operates trading marketplaces. The recession convinced them it was time to take control of their own careers. \n \nFor four months the Oleksaks, who knew nothing about baking, made bagels nightly, letting the dough rise in the darkened laundry closet of their Park Slope apartment. \n \nThey appeared on NBC's Today show and in The Wall Street Journal even before they opened their shop on Bleecker Street. \n \n\"We learn as we do,\" Elyse Oleksak said. Six months ago, they reintroduced their bagels to supermarkets; now their bagel balls are in 2,000 stores and 7,500 Starbucks. \n \nListening to these entrepreneurs, they almost sound like politicians. They speak about \"authenticity,\" \"honesty\" and \"transparency.\" \n \nThat message came across in Carol Healy's No-Bake Cookie Co. booth, designed by her husband, Tom, to resemble a 1950s kitchen. Carol Healy's cookies -- in flavors like chocolate mint, peanut butter and coconut macadamia -- are made from her grandmother's recipes. She sold them at her family's market at a gas station in Bend, Ore., before deciding to turn the cookies into a family business. \n \nSeven years ago, the family built a factory in Bend to make what they call \"the only branded natural no-bake cookie out there.\" Their gluten-free cookie tastes like old-fashioned soft fudge, transmitting the message that it is pure, honest and good. It has no four-syllable ingredients. \n \nNot all efforts have succeeded. Early on, the Healys agreed to pay $1,000 and deliver 850 gift boxes to Off the Wall Gifts, a provider of \"celebrity gifting\" for Emmy Award nominees in the news and documentary category. It was good exposure, they said, but the payoff was minimal for the money they put up. \n \nLast month, Carol Healy was told by Sprouts Farmers Market, a natural and organic supermarket chain, that it was dropping No-Bake Cookies to invest in its own product. \n \nThe Healys remain upset. \"We're the little guy,\" Tom Healy said. \n \nThey spread the little-guy message on social media. On Instagram, they post pictures of people enjoying their cookies, including one of an adorable blue-eyed boy (a relative, naturally). \n \nToday, their cookies are sold in 4,000 stores, twice the number of a year ago. \n \nAs for the Snow Monkey team, Geicke and Ferreira are a startup, working out of their Santa Monica apartment (where they moved, they said, because lots of trends start there) and not taking salaries. \n \nTheir sole employee, Katie Krell, whose title is \"director of impact and partnerships,\" said, \"We are movement-driven -- what you eat can be how you live.\" \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CAROL POGASH THE NEW YORK TIMES"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Entrepreneur news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Food entrepreneurs cook up own careers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-food_startups_3_37-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585"],"sequenceId":"695202394568","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:58Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-food_startups_4_21-22506.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fresno","zipCode":"93786","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fresno","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fresno Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3053"},"name":"Fresno Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fresnobee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202395046","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mayor de Blasio stated \u201cfrom what we\u2019ve heard so far from the medical examiner, it may be a health situation, not anything related to abuse or neglect\u201d (\u201c \u2018Health situation\u2019 may have caused death of Queens boy, 5,\u201d Jan. 25). Is he for real? \n \nThose two so-called parents checked on Little Mikey (they say) at 2:30 a.m. with breathing problems but the mother Phyllis Reinoso said that he seemed fine and then not again for 14 hours, I assume when they decided to wake up \u2014 clearly proving extreme neglect! That would be at 4:30 that afternoon and to top it all off, the child had health problems! That\u2019s not neglect. Are you kidding me? \n \nWe caring parents would, first, never have 13 prior ACS cases; would not leave all those children alone for the 15-year-old to be held responsible day-in and day-out; sleep all day; leave children unsupervised \u2014 and we would constantly check in on them, especially little Mikey because of his health issues. \n \nClearly, this was a total case of abuse and neglect from two people who should never have children under their watch again, ever. They deserve to be in jail and I pray that those poor innocent children will eventually be in the care of loving and responsible guardians. ACS failed them and I hope that the case workers are held responsible and fired, as well as those two so-called parents. And where were the extended family, neighbors and school officials? Not one person cared enough to do the right thing for these innocent victims. \n \nSo please, Mr. Mayor, do not stand there and try to defend the utmost incompetence of ACS just to cover yourself. Sickening and outrageous! Connie Scalice \n ACS\u2019 rap sheet  \nBriarwood: How many more children must die whose families were under investigation by the ACS? Mikey Guzman (Tuesday\u2019s paper), Zamair Coombs (Friday\u2019s), Jaden Jordon in December, Zymere Perkins in the fall. How could this be allowed to continue? Take ACS out of the mayor\u2019s control! Donald Trump, please step in, create a national agency overseeing child protective services for all our cities. Please help the children who need your help so desperately. Patricia Nuzzi \n An even longer rap sheet  \nPlainview, L.I.: Given the decade-long series of child murders that New York City\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services has repeatedly failed to prevent \u2014 including Nixzmary Brown, Elisa Izquierdo, Myls Dobson, Zymere Perkins, Jaden Jordan, Mikey Guzman and Zamair Coombs \u2014 I feel compelled to unofficially re-name ACS with the following: Asses Committing Serial-killings. Sure, the physical murders were actually \u201cadministered\u201d by these children\u2019s monstrous mothers, fathers and mothers\u2019 boyfriends, but they were all virtually enabled by a series of ACS commissioners and workers, (not to mention mayors who also bear much bucks-stop-here responsibility). If every one of these murders had in fact been committed by an actual serial killer, could we ever punish him enough? But none of the many ACS employees who played any (negligent but not negligible) role in any of these deaths have shared in the immense suffering of these young victims in the hours, days, weeks, months or years leading up to their deaths. Mayor de Blasio should be ashamed and angry enough to finally put an end to cases like these that do not have to continue happening. Richard Siegelman \n Repairs needed now  \nManhattan: City Council Public Housing Committee Chairman Ritchie Torres is right in his demand for a larger upfront capital commitment from the city for NYCHA developments (\u201cMayor de Blasio\u2019s pledge to allocate $1 billion over 10 Years to replace roofs at NYCHA,\u201d Jan. 24\u201d). NYCHA residents cannot wait another 10 years for roofs to be fixed. Leaky roofs lead to mold, exacerbate chronic illnesses such as asthma and cause damage to building structures. The city needs to invest $1 billion upfront now so that NYCHA can make the necessary repairs that it has been forced to defer for years. It is time for the city to protect the health and safety of its residents, more than 600,000 New Yorkers. In our new reality, New York City cannot wait for federal dollars to make these major improvements, we must preserve this essential affordable housing now. Lucy Newman, The Legal Aid Society \n Calling out a thief  \nYonkers: To the person who found and kept my cellphone: Thanks for nothing. I dropped my Samsung phone in front of a small restaurant in the Bronx on Jan. 17 or 18 of this year and you had a chance to show me that there are still decent, honest people out there. Instead, when I called that night and spoke with you, you immediately asked for a reward. While I spoke to you, I used my computer to track it to Harlem near W. 129th St. You seemed to agree on returning it but requested that I call you back the next day. I called the phone the rest of week and you never responded again. I\u2019m still paying for that phone. Instead of showing me an honest person, you elected to turn thief. If I had found someone else\u2019s phone, I would\u2019ve gone out of my way to return it \u2014 without requiring a reward. But I guess that\u2019s the difference between you and me. Francisco Matos \n Freedom to march and work  \nHuntington Station, L.I.: One of the more distasteful things shouted at my 85-year-old mother as she sat in a lawn chair, holding an anti-war sign with other members of her Catholic pacifist group, was \u201cGet a job!\u201d It is time for people on all degrees of the political arc to stop accusing those who take the time to stand up for their beliefs of goofing off. I know folks from the hard right to the far left and all of us under 70 are working and paying taxes. People don\u2019t always work 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. With flex time, tele-commuting, etc., we have much more freedom to protest than we used to. Please find some truth-based insults to fling. Ann Rita Darcy \n Double Don  \nWilliamsburg, Va.: President Trump is the reincarnation of both George Patton and Douglas MacArthur \u2014 all blood and guts and someone who knows how to manipulate the press. Trump should keep up the pressure on all his opponents and keep them guessing as to his next move. He is showing significant strength and Vladimir Putin has to be in awe. It will certainly strengthen America\u2019s hand when it comes time to negotiate with Russia. John Lemandri \n No more neo-cons, please  \nNew Rochelle, N.Y.: Cloaked with humanitarian largesse, Charles Krauthammer continues to push the ultra hawkish neo-conservative ideas that are the prime factors for American recession and chaotic global instability (\u201cUnder Trump, America recedes,\u201d Jan. 27). Acting as world policeman with vast military involvement is no longer sustainable and was never wise. Foreign entanglements have detrimentally impacted our middle class economically, as well as with a very serious problem with PTSD and a failed Veterans Administration. Can we please put the neo-conservative agenda where it always belonged \u2014 in the dustbin of history, and move on with President Trump\u2019s vision of American exceptionalism rather than global mediocrity? Patrick O\u2019Connor \n Wall payments  \nStaten Island: I can tell you exactly who\u2019s going to pay for the wall \u2014 the American consumer! The U.S. will put fees and tariffs on goods from Mexico, and those will be passed along to the consumer. Marion Hodgman \n Importing taxes  \nHicksville, L.I.: So Don the Con is having trouble getting Mexico to pay for the wall and his answer is to try imposing a 20% tax on Mexican imports. This, of course, means that the American public will be paying for the wall twice \u2014 once in taxes and again when the purchased goods arrive from Mexico because, as conservatives love to remind us, corporations don\u2019t really pay taxes; they merely pass them through to their customers. Joe Squerciati \n Bad friend  \nQueens Village: After one week in office, Trump managed to tick off Mexico and sour relationships. I wonder what will happen after the visit from England\u2019s prime minister? Gloria L. Catalanotto \n Stay out of jail for free  \nManhattan: So what I got out of the mayor\u2019s speech was if you\u2019re an illegal alien who committed a crime or crimes, come to New York (\u201cMayor de Blasio vows to fight Trump\u2019s anti-immigration order threatening to pull funding for \u2019sanctuary cities\u2019 like NYC,\u201d Jan. 25). We are a sanctuary and will protect you from the government.

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season.

It was all the way back on Jan. 28, 2007. \n \n\"Grocery Store Rage bears many of the earmarks of road rage, without the convenience of traffic lights,\" I wrote. GSR is what you feel \"when you get cut off by somebody turning into your aisle. When you have near-collisions with other shoppers at aisle intersections because the grocery shelves hide your view of them. When you find yourself sandwiched between the slow cart-pushers and the fast cart-pushers. When people don't even bother to scream an 'excuse me' as they practically violate you while trying to slip past you in a tight space. When somebody runs up from nowhere and beats you to an available checkout counter. ... It's enough to make you and Marvin Gaye wanna holler.\" \n \nNow that I'm older and ... well older, I've come the realization that GSR is just the tip of the iceberg. \n \nConsciously or unconsciously, we fight myriad other forms of Errand Rage -- a First-World umbrella term for the various must-dos that cause us to leave the comforts of home or office and compete with others for life's necessities. (Some of it is more paranoia, but for the sake of smart-aleckyness, we'll stick with \"rage.\") And yes, increased susceptibility seems to come hand-in-hand with advancing age. Some examples: \n \nClothing Shopping Rage. This rage comes from finding that even on the regular-price racks, all sizes except yours are present. It comes when you foolishly wait until after Christmas to decide to hunt for tights or over-the-knee boots, and you're hard to fit. It tries to bubble up when you're at one side of a rack, going through it slowly, and another shopper is on the opposite end, going through the racks three times as fast as you are, their search seemingly heck-bent on colliding with your search. It's usually evident when you're in the dressing room and the outfit you loved makes you look like a failed lounge lizard, but is subject to kick in earlier than that when you first look in the mirror and see the underwear-clad body you thought had shed a few pounds. \n \nClothing Clearance/Shoe Sale Rage . Think CSR magnified about 100 times, with 500 times as many fellow customers in your way. \n \nGet Your Car Serviced Rage . The main source of this rage is a given. It's not just the length of the wait ... having today's one-step-away-from-being-those-cartoon Transformers cars serviced or repaired can equal the gross national product of a small country, especially if you have to take your car to the dealership's service department. What really stokes GYCS rage, however, is when you go in for an oil change and the service adviser hunts you down in the waiting area and starts out with, \"We noticed your transmission is slipping out of gear ... .\" You know then that you're about to owe the equivalent of the gross national product of half the countries in South America. A possible mitigation source for this rage: A waiting room stocked with free coffee, cookies, popcorn, doughnuts and, considering how high your bill is, champagne and caviar. \n \nPharmacy Rage . Are you fit to be tied, wondering just how long does it take to find the big bottle of pills, count them out into a little bottle and slap on a new label with the information they already have in their computer? A possible mitigation source: Thinking of what could happen to you if they were to get the prescription wrong. \n \nState Revenue Office Rage. Usually, just thinking about the state Revenue Office -- the place we have to go to get our car licenses, car tags and driver's licenses bearing our less-than-flattering likenesses -- is enough to cause rage. Forgetting we need to avoid the place on the first or last of the week/month or right before/after a holiday is like playing badminton with hand grenades ... go during those times and the very sight of one of those take-a-number machines is subject to set off you off. \n \nBank Rage. Sources of BR are too long to list here, not the least of which is the fact that banks never seem to want to offer any free money samples. \n \nWoo-sah!

Or a stretched canvas. Or the fraught still air of a quiet moment. \n \nGather whatever tools you have. Your paint pots, your pencils, your coffee, your guitar. Your nerve. The flick of hubris you try to keep tamped down during social interactions. That part of you that imagines your expression worth the attention of others. The inarticulate furiousness and dissatisfaction that troubles your sleep. Your conscience. Your truth. \n \nNow begin. \n \nBegin in humility, knowing the point is not to make any display of acumen or effort but simply to try. The point is to do, to fill up a lifetime with doing. To push out fear with busyness. To discover your limits and bloody your nails scraping against them. \n \nDo not imagine an anonymous audience; speak to your ideal intimate. Do not condescend or explain or worry about what they will not understand. For if you are fortunate enough to be heard, you will be misunderstood and willfully misconstrued. If you are noticed, you will be ungenerously appraised. \n \nStill, receive whatever criticism you are lucky enough to get. And remember that this is not therapy. You should not expect to be healed through endeavor. Do not expect any reward beyond that which is inherent in making the thing. Do not expect that you can please those who will not be pleased; do not expect that you can win friends or influence people. \n \nThis is just what you do next, what you do to keep sane. What you do to hold onto your self-respect. \n \nAbove all, you should not pretend. Do not hedge your efforts, but try to strike it flush. And when you miss, try again. Do not worry about the misses. Misses are inevitable and necessary. They are your education and experience. Your exercise. \n \nIf you are wondering what to do next, you need to avoid collapsing into whatever comfort is available. You need to be suspicious of easy habits that lure you into physical and mental lassitude. Comfort can be a trap. There are always those who would prefer you soothed and placated, hypnotized by shiny spinning things. We are liable to trade much away for the illusion that all is well. \n \nYou are an adult, so you know that all is never as well as it might be. The world is no accident; it is what we have made it. It is as much the product of our unreliability and our folly as of any thoughtfulness and foresight. Our society is an expression of our collective will. \n \nBut the world was never a blank--it was rife with creatures before we got here. We inherited a planet precariously balanced between extremes, verdant and blue and hospitable to soft flesh and warm blood. However you look at it, it took a squaring of miracles to bring us here, to deliver us to the top of a food chain, to invent our superstitions and our science. \n \nClimbs are hard. Falls are easy, though they seem unimaginable until they happen. But they happen. All the time. Things fall apart. What we make is unmade. \n \nIt is possible that you will one day be powerless. That your voice won't matter. But now is not that time. \n \nSomeday you may worry that your neighbor will report on you. It is easy to think that cannot happen here, but it could. It has. If you read history you know this, you know how people can imagine themselves good people even as they permit (or suborn) evil. \n \nConsider that one of the lucky things about living in this country, in this age, is that up to now most of us have never really had to make a hard choice about which side we're on. Most of us have been able to take for granted that--no matter how heated the rhetoric becomes--most of what we argue about amounts to very little. \n \nThere are petty inequalities: Someone pays a little more, someone else a little less. Someone is allowed access, someone else waits in the hallway. We are used to being insulated from the consequences of our choices. We can cheer for blue or red; someone will win and someone will lose and they will line up again in a year or two or four and play the game again. \n \nNobody goes to prison. Nobody gets tossed from an airplane in the middle of the night. (Not yet. Not that we know of, at least.) \n \nBut this can change. We might believe we have made something more resilient than what people in other parts of the world have made--a better machine into which we plug the egos and delusions of needy people who imagine themselves great, and who imagine that they might somehow \"lead\" us to greatness (or maybe just want to secure the spoils of office)-- but nothing lasts forever. \n \nYou know how people behave. Why do you imagine yourself immune to the forces of history? Why do you imagine your nation more durable than the empires of the past? Is it because we have better Wi-Fi? \n \nIs it because you believe that God looks on us with special favor? That He loves us more than the others? \n \nIf so, why is that? Because we are so much better at loving our neighbors as ourselves? Because we care so much for the poor and the sick? \n \nIf you are wondering what to do, turn it over in your mind. Start from zero. Imagine what might be, and try to make it so. Distrust what feels easy, the careworn cliches and the analgesic homilies. Question it all. \n \nIf you are wondering what to do next, imagine the world you want. And get to work. \n \npmartin@arkansasonline.com \n \nRead more at \n \nwww.blooddirtangels.com \n \nEditorial on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[],"title":"Wondering what to do next","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202398939","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The following originally appeared in September 2005. \n \nDEAR CAROLYN: This may seem like an odd question, but if someone doesn't like an aspect of your personality, how would you know when you're in the wrong as opposed to someone just not liking that aspect for their own reasons? \n \n-- New York, N.Y. \n \nDEAR READER: Great question. Odd answer: \n \nYou'd think it would be a matter of right and wrong. Should you change this aspect of your personality, because it's somehow bad, or is it good and fine and merely annoying to one person? \n \nBut \"should\" takes a distant third place, to \"want to\" and \"can.\" Is this a part of your personality you want to change? If not, then your critic gets to love it or leave it. \n \nAnd even if you do want to change it, can you? If you're, say, a worrywart, and your friend/mate/sibling/colleague hates that you're a worrywart, and you also wish you could stop worrying, then you could probably learn a few techniques to lessen your stress. \n \nBut you will never become anything approaching laid-back, and so it would be wrong to keep fighting this aspect of your personality, and wrong for critics to pressure you to. \n \nYour best chance of finding peace with others is to make some peace with yourself, by accepting a less-than-perfect aspect of your personality, making the best use of it, being careful not to take it out on others, using all this as a way to like your less-than-perfect self -- and then letting your critics love it or leave it from there. \n \nDEAR CAROLYN: I'm not sure how to set effective boundaries with my in-laws. My husband and I are newlyweds. When last we visited them, they showed a family digital slide show. Mixed in were pictures of a woman my husband had been in a relationship with (over 10 years ago). I left the room after several \"Oops, we should have sorted these before we showed them to you\" and more pictures. \n \nThe mother's defense was, \"Well, it is his history.\" I talked to my husband, who later that evening explained to them that neither of us wants to see these pictures. \n \nWell, there were apologies and we felt we made real progress in our relationship with them -- respect established. \n \nUntil the next night, when again several pictures happened to pop up of another ex. At this point I said calmly, \"I am not going to watch this,\" and removed myself from the room. \n \nI feel unaccepted by them and am not sure if this is just poor insight, judgment and taste on their part or if this is blatant disrespect. \n \n-- M. \n \nDEAR READER: \"Respect established\"? Nothing like sharing a bucket of grins with the in-laws. \n \nIt's not your boundaries that need toughening, it's your skin. \n \nYou've given me two choices, between declaring your in-laws thoughtless or declaring them outright hostile to you. \n \nI strongly recommend you give yourself a third choice: that they're regular people with a lot of life behind them and a commensurate photographic record that they, oops, didn't get around to updating. \n \nOr a fourth choice, that they're people with a view of former loves that differs vastly from yours. Maybe to them it's their son's life story, no more, no less, no harm intended. \n \nBoth mean it's possible that showing these pictures was no reflection on, or statement about, you. \n \nAnd if that was the case, then your protest didn't establish respect, it established that you feel threatened, insecure, so afraid you won't be accepted that you're afraid to laugh at yourself. \n \nOr: Their apologies make this unlikely, but, maybe you're right that they left those photos in on purpose. \n \nIf that was the case, then your protest didn't establish respect. It established that they'd won. They'd gotten to you. \n \nRegardless of their intent, their son married you, not these other women. Stop trying to prove what plainly already is. Let them worry about what they accept and why. What your in-laws think and do have no bearing on who you are. \n \nKnow that, and then use it, either to make light of the old girlfriend thing -- \"Hey, you said there was no one until you met me!!!\" -- or, if it's the best you can do, to get through it with something resembling perspective. A few raindrops don't bother a rock. \n \nDEAR CAROLYN: Why is it so hard just to end a bad relationship? Seriously. \n \n-- I Feel Like I Should \n \nBe Smarter Than This \n \nDEAR READER: Because you sought out this bad relationship for a reason -- you got something out of it, and are still getting something out of it. \n \nSomething maybe you don't even know you need. \n \nFind the need, find the source and fix it. Then the only obstacle to getting out is getting through the unabridged edition of hell that all breakups turn out to be. \n \nChat online with Carolyn at 11 a.m. Central time each Friday at washingtonpost.com.

Posts about children. \n \nEveryone smiles when they see pictures of adorable, well-dressed, respectful children on social media. \n \nWell, not all children. \n \nHey, that's 15-year-old Sasha Obama; leave her out of this, you bully! \n \nWait, that's 10-year-old Barron Trump; leave him alone, you meanie! \n \n3. Post food pictures. \n \nIt's universally considered lame to post food photos (not that it has stopped me; if I make dinner, it is documented for the entire globe to see, darn it). But these days, such doses of normalcy and neutrality are refreshing. Just make sure the foods are sustainable, farm-to-table, organic, cruelty-free, egg-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, fat-free, GMO-free, soy-free and peanut-free. In other words, food-free. \n \n4. Support people. \n \nEven if you don't agree with someone's political stance, you can surely find something pleasant to say to him or her. \n \nExamples from both sides: \"I don't really understand your reasons for protesting a decided free election, but hey, that, um, anatomically correct costume you're wearing looks great on you; pink really is your color.\" And: \"I can't for the life of me figure out why you'd vote for that orange guy, but, hey, I like Nacho Cheese Doritos, too!\" \n \nAnd when they yell back at you in all-caps, that's just another opportunity to offer admiration. \"I want you to know that I praise your passion ... no matter how misdirected it is!\" \n \n5. Post animal pictures. \n \nWho doesn't love soft, furry animals? Like donkeys -- um, not those. Like elephants -- uh, not those either. Swine? Too likely to bring up male chauvinist pig jokes. Cats? They have gotten political with all the grab-speak and pink hats. Dogs. Everyone still loves dogs, right? Well, they did until Sunny, one of the outgoing president's pooches, bit a White House guest. \n \nForget it. When it comes to animals, we're chickening (who are you calling a chick? That's so demeaning!) out. \n \n6. Discuss fashion. \n \nCan't we all agree that at the inauguration, Melania Trump looked magnificent in her sky blue Ralph Lauren ensemble? That Hillary Clinton rocked her Ralph Lauren pantsuit/coat? That Michelle looked regal in her burgundy Jason Wu outfit? That President Donald Trump's daughters Ivanka and Tiffany Trump were the picture of perfection in their power white? We can't? Sheesh, even the subject of clothing makes us come apart at the seams. \n \n7. Discuss your favorite entertainment artists/outlets. \n \nLike Madonna, Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd who spoke out at the recent march? Mmm, better not. Like Scott Baio, Caitlyn Jenner and Jon Voight who attended Trump's inauguration? Um, not a good idea. Like SNL ? Ah, no. We can't even discuss Kim Kardashian (who endorsed Trump's rival Clinton) and Kanye West (who paid a visit to Trump after the election) anymore. \n \nSurely there's some kind of entertainment phenomenon that we all can get behind? The Bachelor ! Let's talk about three-time franchise loser Nick Viall and the harem of kooky women -- like that Corinne who is 24 years old and has a nanny named Raquel to take care of her (!) -- who are fighting for him! Nah. Too many people find the show sexist. \n \nAnd can we really be sure of nanny Raquel's legal status? \n \n8. Power down. \n \nThe only way to avoid all social media conflict during these sensitive times is to avoid acquaintances. Flee from Facebook. Split from Twitter. And scram from Instagram. It has another benefit: You'll be conserving energy. \n \nNevermind. We dare not get into energy policy. \n \nInaugurate an email: \n \njchristman@arkansasonline.com \n \nSpin Cycle is a smirk at pop culture.

We meet him and his crew -- Graves (Barry Sloane), Ortiz (Juan-Pablo Raba) and Caulder (Kyle Schmid), most notably -- on a mission in Afghanistan. Things go sideways. Two years later, suddenly, we are in Virginia Beach, Va., where the SEALs await assignments -- all but Taggart, now a drunk working private security in Lagos, Nigeria. (Flashbacks will later explain the why and wherefore.) \n \nOn what promises to be a routine baby-sitting job for a self-promoting American philanthropist -- civilians, ugh -- Taggart is taken hostage, along with a schoolteacher and her class of girls, by forces of Boko Haram. I think you know what happens next. (Yes, his old guys -- now with new guy Chase, played by Edwin Hodge -- go after him.) There are also Middle East terrorists lurking about, along with sympathetic Americans and Russians, just to touch on as many bases as possible. \n \nThe series was created by William Broyles Jr. and his son, David Broyles. The elder Broyles, a Vietnam War veteran, became a journalist and editor and eventually a screenwriter: He co-created China Beach for ABC and co-wrote Ron Howard's Apollo 13 and Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers among other films; the younger Broyles served in Iraq and Afghanistan and has written or directed a few short films. \n \nHistory calls this an \"authentic portrayal\" of the SEAL life, which for all I know it is; technical adviser Mitchell Hall, who has also worked on Zero Dark Thirty , is a retired SEAL; CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen consults on terrorism. \n \nBut it is also a television show, and it works like other TV shows and movies. Situations are invented, costumed actors read lines or run about with guns, and while the good guys may be reasonably expected to take some hits along the way, we watch with fair certainty that the villains -- who are at best moderately complex and sometimes just targets to shoot -- will be appropriately repaid. \n \nIt is not Homeland , where the war on terror is a pretext to explore sometimes twisted characters. There are characters here, given characteristics, but what matters is the mission -- and saluting the institution. \n \nEach of the men has been given a special domestic situation, not incidental to their common troubles dealing with feelings and understanding women. (They are also united by beer and beards.) \n \nOrtiz's wife, Jackie (Nadine Velazquez), is going back to work, much to his annoyance, and he is a stranger to his children. (Finds daughter with a boy in her room. Boy: \"I want you to know, Mr. Ortiz, that I respect your daughter as a woman.\" Daughter: \"I hate you, you're ruining everything.\") Then there's Caulder, who lives in a (fairly nice) shack by the beach, into whose life comes a trouble-making de-estranged 17-year-old daughter (Lindsley Register). And Graves and his missus, Lena (Brianne Davis) -- whose shared Christianity the script makes a point of -- are trying to start a family, with difficulty. \n \nThe actors do their best to put life into these scenes, but they are so brief and expository, given how much territory there is to cover, that they feel mostly manufactured. \n \nStill, action is action -- and this action is well staged -- and it's reliably compelling to watch the good guys, with their night-vision goggles, special guns and ninja tread, going after the bad. If you wade even a little way into these waters, you may find yourself swimming the length of the pool, just to get to the other side. \n \nStyle on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ROBERT LLOYD Los Angeles Times"},"topics":[],"title":"Six's gripping action scenes pump up SEAL team tale","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202400262","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Photo provided  \n \nBy Anne Duggan \nThe ski tracks leading Carleton Ravens cross-country skier Carrington Pomeroy to the FISU World Student Games in Almaty, Kazakhstan this month include some unexpected stops and starts. Those come from the Tuesday/Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings when he coaches younger athletes in the same direction. \n\nThe FISU Winter Universiade is held every two years, and is a gathering of the world\u2019s best student-athletes. For Pomeroy, the Jan. 29-Feb. 8 event represents the achievement of a life-long goal. \n\n\u201cEvery young athlete wants this,\u201d underlines the fourth-year Raven from Chelsea. \u201cYou always want to represent your country. That\u2019s what I get to do. I get to race for Canada.\u201d \n\nBeginning with the 10 km classic, Pomeroy hopes to compete in all six FISU races, from the team sprint to the 30 km individual distance race. The 24-year-old earned his place on the 5-member Canadian men\u2019s team thanks to a consistent 2016 race season, where he accumulated top points from his best seven distance races and four sprints. \n\nOne of Pomeroy\u2019s other efforts last year had surprising benefits towards his goal of consistent results. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting, but the thing that has helped me the most, technique-wise, has been to coach it,\u201d explains the Nakkertok Nordic athlete/coach. \u201cIt helps me to understand why I am doing it. Like making sure their ski poles are at head-level to get over top of them and get the most out of each push.\u201d \n\nFor the last two years, Pomeroy has been an instrumental part of the coaching team led by Nakkertok junior development coach Kieran Jones and Anneke Winegarden, who train Nakkertok\u2019s 50 juvenile and junior athletes, ages 12 through 18. \n\nIt\u2019s not a glamorous or even a comfortable job \u2013 often done in the dark, the wet and the cold, with sometimes distracted and always-social teenagers. But Pomeroy and the coaching team clearly get the job done and well. \n\nHome to many Ottawa members, their Cantley-based club has taken home the national championship team banner for the last seven years. Nakkertok\u2019s juvenile and junior teams, the club\u2019s largest age groups, are the engine behind this effort. \n\nPomeroy, who began his cross-country ski career as a 10-year-old with Chelsea Nordiq, is quick to point out that he has also benefited from coaching in the more traditional way. \n\nChelsea juvenile coach Chris Alderson \u201cbrought the fun of competition to me and my friends,\u201d while Jones, who started coaching Pomeroy in his high school years, has also had a \u201chuge\u201d influence. \n\n\u201cA mentor, a coach and a friend,\u201d Pomeroy says of Jones. \u201cAll that he ever wants for his athletes is to achieve their goals. Getting to talk and train with him is the big reason that I have stayed in the sport. \n\n\u201cIt feels like my goals are his goals and that is motivating.\u201d \n\nThe toughest part of Pomeroy\u2019s trail to international competition has been \u201caffording everything, and finding the time to afford everything,\u201d he highlights. The environmental science student says the cost of a ski season for an athlete of his level runs between $5,000-$10,000, plus there\u2019s tuition, so that means working as a coach, a teaching assistant at Carleton, and in sales for Greg Christie\u2019s Ski and Cycle Works in Old Chelsea. \n\n\u201cOn top of this there are 20 hours of school per week and 12-15 hours of skiing,\u201d adds Pomeroy, noting it takes time management, energy and the occasional \u201cpower bar\u201d \u2013 consisting of a lot of chocolate and graham cracker crumbs made by his mother Lee Anne Johnston \u2013 to get Pomeroy through his loaded weeks. \n\nLuckily, the source of Pomeroy\u2019s motivation is found along the ski trails \u2013 especially on cold, sunny days \u2013 with a group of his teammates. \n\n\u201cAll the skiers at Nakkertok and Carleton make coming to practice and races much more fun,\u201d indicates the 2015 Ontario university team champion and winner of a silver medal and 2 bronze nationally. \u201cThe social side of it is really appealing to me. I will graduate on time and have had a really good four years of skiing. And now I get to ski at an international event, which was a big goal.\u201d \n\nLocal hockey players on FISU squads Canada\u2019s FISU hockey teams will have their fair share of Ottawa flair.

While recent terrorist attacks may have scared away some travelers, I return every year for a rewarding experience and feel perfectly safe. Regrettably, France's high profile and bold leadership in matters of pluralism have made it a target, so heightened concerns there about terrorism have led to more safeguards. Travelers can expect a greater security presence and extra checkpoints at tourist-oriented sights. For instance, at Versailles, there are now two security checks for the chateau -- one at the gate outside the courtyard and a second before entering the building. \n \nAs usual, Paris is evolving. After a long closure, its Picasso Museum is spiffed up and welcoming more tourists than ever. A major renovation at the Rodin Museum has wrapped up, and the museum is fully open. Meanwhile, the Carnavalet Museum, which covers the tumultuous history of Paris, is closed for 2017 and beyond as it receives an overhaul. \n \nA new addition to the Paris shopping scene is the Forum des Halles, a modern mall under a vast glass-and-steel canopy. Old-timers remember Les Halles as Paris' gigantic central produce market. Demolished in the 1970s, it was replaced with an underground shopping mall. Now the complex has been transformed into a modern shopping center and a massive underground transportation hub capped by a huge city park. \n \nThe region around Paris is studded with grand chateaux. The grandest of these is Versailles, where the Queen's Wing is closed for extensive renovation. For cheap and efficient day-tripping to two other top chateaux -- Vaux-le-Vicomte and Fontainebleau -- visitors can now buy a regional Mobilis ticket, which covers any travel within a day in the greater Paris region, including Metro rides to and from the train station and round-trip train fare, as well as the bus connecting the Fontainebleau station to the chateau (but not the shuttle from Verneuil-l'Etang train station to Vaux-le-Vicomte). \n \nIn Normandy, the D-Day Experience museum at St.-Come-du-Mont now gives visitors a chance to pretend they're paratroopers and take a simulated (yet still thrilling) flight on a vintage Douglas C-47. In Verdun -- another area famous for its battlefields -- the Verdun Memorial Museum has reopened to mark the 100th anniversary of the World War I battle. Among its exhibits is a 1916 battlefield replica, visible through a glass floor and complete with mud, shells, trenches and military equipment. \n \nThe big news for prehistoric art lovers is the opening of the International Center for Cave Art at Lascaux, highlighted by a brand-new replica cave that faithfully reproduces the reindeer, horse and bull paintings found in the original cave using the same dyes, tools and techniques that predecessors used 15,000 years ago. Reservations are highly recommended. \n \nFinally, France continues to improve its transportation infrastructure. With the last link complete in its high-speed rail line, it's just two hours from Paris to Strasbourg, the capital of the Alsace region in northeast France. For much cheaper (if slower) transit to other large cities in France, as well as London, Amsterdam and Brussels, OuiBus offers convenient and comfortable bus service with Wi-Fi and an English-speaking driver. \n \nIn Belgium, France's neighbor to the north, the capital city of Brussels has pedestrianized part of the Boulevard Anspach and surrounding streets, creating the second largest car-free zone in Europe. Because of this, many bus routes have changed, and crosstown cabs take more time getting around the downtown core. Visitors should consider using the Metro instead. \n \nAbout 10 miles south of Brussels, the new Memorial 1815 museum commemorates the Battle of Waterloo with a 3-D movie and high-tech displays, giving visitors an engaging and informative trip through the site of Napoleon's crushing defeat. \n \nFarther north, in the Netherlands, Amsterdam is thriving. In fact, it's getting so crowded with tourists that the mayor -- concerned about the flood of cheese stores, chocolate shops and kitschy tourism changing the city into a kind of amusement park -- recently decided to stop promoting the city, even recommending visitors consider Rotterdam or Delft instead. \n \nTo control crowds at the popular Anne Frank House, only people holding reservations can visit between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Tickets can be booked online exactly two months in advance -- and should be; they sell out quickly. \n \nAmsterdam's fascinating and hidden \"church in the attic,\" the Amstelkring Museum, has a new entrance building.

She and her husband, Christian, left successful careers in New York to make fine-art wallpaper in the Ozarks... \n   \nRolls of wallpaper are stacked in a converted seed mill in Witter, an unincorporated community in Madison County. \n   \nChristian and Heidi Batteau work with wallpaper in their studio. The couple makes wallpaper that sells anywhere from $60 to $400 a yard. Some of the w... \n   \nHeidi and Christian Batteau converted an old seed mill into an art studio where they make high-end wallpaper in the Ozarks. \n  \nIn 2011 the couple left successful careers in textile design and sculpture in Brooklyn, N.Y., and moved to Heidi's native Witter to pursue their dream of living off of their farm and developing a unique way to make custom wallpaper. \n \nTheir work, which can cost anywhere from $60 to $400 a yard, now hangs on the walls of homes, hotels, offices and stores across five continents, including in four of the world's top 10 tallest buildings. And their company, Assemblage Art & Craft Manufacturing, shows no signs of slowing down. \n \nAfter Chanel asked whether it was possible to replicate a piece of fabric in wallpaper form in 2004, Christian Batteau, 42, set to work trying to find a way to do it. The Los Angeles-native studied sculpture and spent time working for contemporary artist Jeff Koons but said he has been working with plaster and painting \"to support my sculpture hobby\" since age 17. \n \nMost handmade wallpaper is applied directly to the wall, which requires paying expensive crews for weeks to install on-site. With that process it is also impossible to produce the kinds of designs like the Batteaus now make, because gravity causes them to drip. \n \nHe tweaked paint formulas and experimented with different kinds of paper until he found the perfect formula that would be able to handle heavy products like layers of marble dust plaster, precious metals, beeswax and lacquer and not crack when rolled up for transport. \n \nThey eventually ended up with the perfect recipe that has allowed the Batteaus' business to take off on a global scale. Unlike traditional bespoke -- or made-to-order -- wallpaper, their product can be shipped anywhere and takes just a day to put up. \n \nTheir adopted home in Arkansas has made the business and their current lives possible, they said. \"We could not be doing this in New York,\" said Heidi Batteau, 35. \n \n\"It's a competitive industry, and we would have to charge more to pay our artists a livable wage. If somebody is coming to work for us on contract, it's got to be worth it for them to be flexible with the production schedule. In New York we were paying people $20-$25 an hour. The profit margin was low, and you can't even live well on that wage in the city.\" \n \nThey have had two children since they moved, something they say they couldn't find a way to do in New York, given the costs and space constraints. \n \nBatteau grew up in Witter, an unincorporated community in Madison County. Her mother, Betty Blackwood, still owns and operates a hand-crafted textile company, Dogwood Designs, in Witter. \n \n\"I knew there was a large craft movement here. There are a lot of people here supporting themselves by making things,\" Batteau said. \"You see that and think, OK, we can do this. We can go out there and make a living.\" \n \n\"Although,\" she qualified, \"it was a lot scarier once we actually got here.\" \n \nWhile their best year so far has yielded $850,000 in revenue, it took time to see numbers like that. \n \n\"Brand equity is way harder to generate than I realized,\" Christian Batteau said. \"When you have a new brand, big architecture firms are reticent to place purchases from you, because they're trying to see whether you survive.\" \n \n\"We had to wait that out. It took two years. And in the meantime, we were doing anything to make a living,\" he said. \"I was chopping wood on the side to pay the people working for us.\" \n \n\"You constantly wonder, should we just say it's done and go back?\" Heidi Batteau recalled. \"But you've got to try and keep your positive attitude.\" \n \nAs to why he stuck it out, Christian Batteau said, \"I believed in the dream. It sounds ridiculous. But I believed in being able to have our sustainable life, grow our own food, hire people for a livable wage and make beautiful work.\" \n \nRecently, with help from international sales representation, the Batteaus' business has expanded beyond exclusively custom orders to existing designs people order specifically. \"It has made the business steadier,\" Heidi Batteau said. \n \nAnother component of their customer service is \"value engineering,\" Christian Batteau said. \"By removing some of the more expensive layers like marble dust plaster, someone like Banana Republic can afford to buy a design, instead of just a Chanel,\" he said. \n \n\"We are an art studio,\" Heidi Batteau said. \"We'll do anything. If someone comes to us and says, 'Can you do it?' We will do it.\" \n \nTheir flexibility and willingness to customize has proved one of their strongest selling points. They have taken things like fabrics, tortoiseshell and leathers and interpreted them into complex wallpaper design, and they have taken complicated and expensive designs down a notch for smaller budgets. \n \n\"They're so approachable even though they're producing this really beautiful, luxurious art,\" said Nancy Winston, general manager for the Texas showrooms of Holly Hunt, a company that designs and manufacturers home furnishings and also represents Assemblage. \n \n\"They've done installations for the likes of Louis Vuitton, but you can create your own little jewel in your powder room or bathroom. For example, they use a lot of precious metals, but there are alternatives if budgets don't allow for that.\" \n \n\"Assemblage is one of my favorites to work with because they are so hands-on and passionate,\" she said. \"It makes it fun. You can feel how committed and detail-oriented they are, and you just know it's going to work for a client. Mistakes don't happen, because they are so detail-oriented.\" \n \nThere are almost no other businesses around the world producing work like the Batteaus. Most wallpaper is printed nowadays. Christian Batteau said that even when he tried to outsource orders when it was particularly busy, he could not find a competitor willing to do the same work at the same price. \n \n\"It's a lost craft,\" he said. \n \nThe more the Batteaus are doing this, the more orders they have received -- more than 400 as of now. These early weeks of 2017 were supposed to be quiet for them, but they suddenly have five rush orders on their hands. \n \n\"It's finally started to really take off in the last six to eight months,\" Heidi Batteau said. \n \nThey've had to hire artists from around the area to help, but they have long-term dreams to bring on even more. They are interested in someday exploring furniture and lighting design and expanding their production studio into a co-working space for other craftsmen. \n \nIn the meantime, they continue to run their global company from Arkansas 23, but they hope to increase engagement with architects and interior designers closer to home. \n \n\"We interact with the world constantly. This morning I was interacting with Chanel in France,\" Heidi Batteau said. \n \nHowever, she said, \"I would love to be able to have more local support and work.\" \n \n\"I think people don't know that we're here,\" Christian Batteau said. \"We really are engaged globally, but the local thing is a piece of the puzzle we've just been starting to cultivate.\" \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Artists\u2019 wallpaper goes global","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-adgbwallpaper0129-006_32-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585","http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-adgbwallpaper0129-004_3-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585","http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-adgbwallpaper0129-003_86-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585","http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-adgbwallpaper0129-007_80-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585"],"sequenceId":"695202401556","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-adgbwallpaper0129-008_35-22506.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

They were very lucky.\" \n \nMs Morgan explained it took those cats a few weeks to settle back down as they had to be relocated while their room was repaired, which was \"upsetting for them.\" \n \nOne of the surviving cats has since been adopted. \n \nMs Morgan said since the sanctuary became well known, they have seen a lot more cats come and go. \n \n\"Adoptions have increased, but then the other side of the coin we've had more in,\" she said. \n \n\"It's swings and roundabouts.\" \n \nAfter the incident an online fundraising campaign was started with more than £17,000 raised in just four days. \n \nThat figure is now just shy of £20,000 thanks to the donations of 1,418 people. \n \n\"We were absolutely overwhelmed at the public response,\" said Ms Ahmad. \n \n\"I can't thanks everybody enough. They've really helped us and our volunteers.\" \n \nSome of the money has already been spent repairing the pens that were broken into, with the old mesh replaced by galvanised fencing bolted down to the floor. \n \n\"There's no way anyone can cut through it,\" said Ms Ahmad. \n \nSecurity around the sanctuary has also been improved with CCTV cameras, alarms and sensor lighting. \n \nAll the pens have also been renewed in the cattery, which Ms Ahmad said \"provides the cats and future cats with a \"higher standard of living\". \n \nA large amount of the money has and will continue to go towards the sanctuary's veterinary bills, which is a \"huge outgoing.\" \n \nThe sanctuary is now campaigning for a change in the law to get harsher sentences for people convicted of animal offences. \n \nMs Morgan said: \"At the moment judges' hands are tied by their sentencing guidelines. \n \n\"We were told we were lucky he was sentenced to 12 months as he could have got a suspended sentence.\" \n \nA petition \"demanding justice for the cats of Ty Nant Cat Sanctuary\" has been set up and has so far collected more than 223,000 signatures. \n \nIt proposes a register be introduced which anyone convicted of animal abuse, neglect or cruelty will have to sign. \n \nThe petition said: \"This will ensure that perpetrators are monitored and details of their crimes can be found.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Humanity's 'best and worst'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"BBC","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587494","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1920"},"name":"BBC","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/","publisher":"British Broadcasting Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202401740","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:35Z","media":{"logo":[{"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1"}],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This latest is the only one with actors honoring actors. \n \nThe 23rd Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards , airs from 7-9 p.m. today on TNT and TBS with Lily Tomlin scheduled for the SAG Life Achievement Award. It will be presented by her 1980 9 to 5 co-stars Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton. \n \nCarol Burnett received the award last year. \n \nOf all the industry awards presented to actors, only the SAG Awards are selected entirely by the performers' peers in SAG-AFTRA. AFTRA stands for the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. It merged with SAG in 2012. \n \nTwo randomly selected panels of 2,500 members each choose the nominees for television and motion pictures. All active members of the organization -- more than 115,000 -- received voting information. \n \nSAG-AFTRA membership includes actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, disc jockeys, news writers and editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voice-over artists and other professionals. \n \nThirteen awards will be handed out during the live broadcast. The awards focus not only on individual performances, but the entire ensemble of a TV drama and comedy, and the cast of a motion picture as well. \n \nAmong the presenters this year are Casey Affleck, Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Lucas Hedges, Taraji P. Henson, Brie Larson, Janelle Monae, Viggo Mortensen and Octavia Spencer. \n \nTrivia: The 42-year-old Ali's birth name is Mahershalalhashbaz Gilmore. Mahershalalhashbaz, meaning \"He has made haste to the plunder,\" is from the Book of Isaiah. \n \nAli has the most nominations (three) for Moonlight and Hidden Figures . \n \nThe 16-inch statuette, known simply as \"The Actor,\" is solid bronze with a green-black patina finish and mounted on a base of polished black granite. It weighs 12 pounds. Since the beginning, 952 statuettes have been awarded. \n \nHere are the TV nominees with my picks on who is most deserving. \n \nMale, Miniseries/TV Movie: Riz Ahmed, The Night Of ; Sterling K. Brown, The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story ; Bryan Cranston, All the Way ; John Turturro, The Night Of ; Courtney B. Vance, The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story . \n \nMy pick: Vance. His role as Johnnie Cochran was the best in a miniseries loaded with outstanding performances. \n \nFemale, Miniseries/TV Movie: Bryce Dallas Howard, Black Mirror ; Felicity Huffman, American Crime ; Audra McDonald, Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill ; Sarah Paulson, The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story ; Kerry Washington, Confirmation . \n \nMy pick: Paulson. Her depiction of Marcia Clark gave the role uncommon depth and nuance. \n \nMale, Drama: Sterling K. Brown, This Is Us ; Peter Dinklage, Game of Thrones ; John Lithgow, The Crown ; Rami Malek, Mr. Robot ; Kevin Spacey, House of Cards . \n \nMy pick: Lithgow. He showed us the very human side of an aging Winston Churchill. \n \nFemale, Drama: Millie Bobby Brown, Stranger Things ; Claire Foy, The Crown ; Thandie Newton, Westworld ; Winona Ryder, Stranger Things ; Robin Wright, House of Cards . \n \nMy pick: Brown. The 12-year-old had the role of her young life as Jane \"Eleven\" Ives. We'll see a great deal more of her as the years pass by. \n \nMale, Comedy: Anthony Anderson, black-ish ; Tituss Burgess, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ; Ty Burrell, Modern Family ; William H. Macy, Shameless ; Jeffrey Tambor, Transparent . \n \nMy pick: Macy. His odious Frank Gallagher is a guy you love to hate. Or hose down. \n \nFemale, Comedy: Uzo Aduba, Orange Is the New Black ; Jane Fonda, Grace and Frankie ; Ellie Kemper, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Veep ; Lily Tomlin, Grace and Frankie . \n \nMy pick: Louis-Dreyfus, in a category that could use some fresh blood. \n \nEnsemble, Drama:  The Crown ; Downton Abbey ; Game of Thrones ; Stranger Things ; Westworld . \n \nMy pick: Westworld . HBO's \"next big thing\" had its uneven moments, but it's ambitious and always leaves you wanting more. \n \nEnsemble, Comedy:  The Big Bang Theory ; black-ish ; Modern Family ; Orange Is the New Black ; Veep . \n \nMy pick: The Big Bang Theory . Remarkably, TV's No. 1 comedy is still going strong in its 10th season. \n \n\u2022 Miss Universe , 6 p.m. today on Fox, live from the Philippines. This is the pageant where host Steve Harvey infamously announced the wrong winner. Hopefully, he gets it right this time. \n \nWant to root for the home team? Miss USA is Deshauna Barber.

Ying won't be making the traditional pilgrimage back to Shanghai to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday with her extended family. Instead, they're all going to Japan for shopping and sightseeing. \n \nThat new custom lets her family bypass the mobs, clogged roads and subways, lousy customer services -- and boredom -- that can mark holidays at home. During the past few celebrations, Shi and her relatives left China for Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States. \n \n\"The last thing my parents want for the Chinese New Year is a cheerless holiday with the three of us staying home in Shanghai,\" said Shi, 30, who works for a nongovernmental organization in Beijing. \"Going overseas during the Spring Festival costs about the same as going to some domestic tourist spots.\" \n \nThe essence of China's seven-day holiday, also called Spring Festival, is morphing as rising incomes and an expanding network of international flights prompt more people to go abroad -- the equivalent of Americans choosing Bermuda over the Midwest for Thanksgiving. Outbound travel for the holiday break is expected to top a record 6 million passengers, with airlines hauling near-full loads to Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. \n \n\"Chinese New Year is a major international peak for the Chinese airlines,\" said Steve Saxon, a Shanghai-based partner at consultant McKinsey & Co. \"For many, this is one of the only two opportunities to take a long holiday during the year.\" \n \nThe Spring Festival shuts down the world's second-biggest economy for a week as hundreds of millions of factory and office workers leave their adopted homes in Shenzhen or Beijing to reconnect with their ancestral ones, often on the opposite side of the country. Thousands more expatriates return. \n \nThis year's celebration, which began Friday and goes through Thursday, will see the biggest mass migration of people on Earth. More than 414 million Chinese will ride in planes and trains -- as if everyone in the European Union was on the move. \n \nAbout 58.3 million people are expected to fly, representing a 10 percent increase from last year, according to estimates by the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Chinese airlines generate about 20 percent of their revenue during this period, Saxon said. \n \nChinese will travel to 174 destinations outside mainland China for an average of 9.2 days during the holiday period, according to online travel service Ctrip.com International Ltd. \n \n\"Any airline should be able to swim in money during a Chinese traveling holiday,\" said Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. \n \nFueling those excursions is an economy growing annually by at least 6.7 percent since 1990, giving people more money to spend. Disposable income for urban households rose 165 percent from 2006 to 2015, reaching about $4,551, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. \n \nInstead of going back to her hometown in the northeast China forest, Xi Chunhui is going to Macau, Singapore and Hong Kong for 11 days with a friend. \n \n\"The Spring Festival celebration is the same old thing every year at home,\" said Xi, 27, an editor for an internet portal in Beijing. \"I don't think me not being there with them will kill the mood.\" \n \nGoing sightseeing abroad also is a consequence of the government's generations-long policy restricting most families to one child, said Catherine Lim, a Singapore-based analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. A more-affluent younger generation now wants to see the world, she said. \n \n\"When your entire family size shrinks, there really isn't much to do\" at home, Lim said. \"They want to spend more money -- particularly the younger generation -- on experiencing new destinations rather than buying the biggest Hermes bag.\" \n \nChina is the biggest source of overseas travelers in the world, with 128 million people spending $292 billion on their trips in 2015, according to the World Tourism Organization. \n \nThat has been a boon to the nation's airlines, with demand running so high that discounts are ending as many as 50 days before takeoff, according to Ctrip.com. The top-dollar tickets help carriers make up for the massive price cuts offered during slow seasons. \n \nChina Southern Airlines Co., Asia's biggest carrier, added nearly 3,600 flights during this peak travel season -- and expanded services to Australia and New Zealand, the Guangzhou-based airline said. Subsidiary Xiamen Airlines Co. is adding more than 100 flights to Southeast Asia destinations such as Bali and the Maldives, said Hu Nan, a manager for international business. \n \nChina Eastern Airlines Corp., based in Shanghai, added 400 flights starting this month mostly to connect second-tier cities with Okinawa, Japan; Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Thailand; and Cebu, Philippines. \n \n\"All the airlines in China, not just us, are throwing in all resources to brace for the Chinese New Year travel,\" Hu said. \"There is no slack there.\" \n \nOn the destination sides, Japan, Australia and even Israel are rolling out the welcome mats for Chinese tourists by offering multiple-year, multiple-entry visas to Chinese passport holders. The United Arab Emirates is going a step further by offering visas upon arrival, according to state-run Xinhua News Agency. \n \nChinese visitors to Japan jumped 28 percent last year to 6.4 million -- the most from any country, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. \n \nWhen they arrived, they spent $12.8 billion, according to the separate Japan Tourism Agency. Chinese perceive Japanese electronics, luxury items and consumer goods like cosmetics and toothpaste to be of better quality than those made at home. \n \n-- Information for this story was contributed by Kyunghee Park, Chris Cooper and Lee Miller of Bloomberg News. \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Chinese to spend holiday traveling","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202402848","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-309281205_1-8_40-22506.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car.

One of the tallest: building it without undocumented workers. \n \nA labor shortage has left few hands to build houses and factories in the region, where wages have already been rising and projects delayed. Now, the president's plan for \"immediate construction of a border wall\" will force the government to find legal builders for a project that could employ thousands if not tens of thousands. \n \nAbout half of construction workers in Texas are undocumented, and nationwide 14 percent lack authorization for employment in the United States, according to the Workers Defense Project, an Austin, Texas, group that advocates for undocumented laborers. \n \n\"If he is going to build a wall with legal workers in Texas, he is going to have a very hard time,\" said Stan Marek, chief executive officer of Marek Brothers, a Houston commercial builder. \"There is a real shortage of legal labor.\" \n \nThe wall, whose cost has been estimated as high as $25 billion, is shaping up to be one of America's biggest public-works projects since the building of the Hoover Dam during the Great Depression. Trump, who has promised to create jobs by investing more than half a trillion dollars in massive infrastructure projects, will face practical obstacles. While many people think of the border as little more than desert, the almost 2,000-mile terrain includes sand dunes, arroyos and craggy mountains. New roads and temporary concrete plants may have to be built to reach the most desolate areas. \n \n\"Contractors in general throughout the country have been saying it's been difficult to get workers,\" said Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America. \"Getting workers who would be vetted to work on government projects and then getting them to these locations, which are pretty far away, would be among the many challenges in getting this done.\" \n \nCompanies might jump at the wall job, for profit and proximity to the president, and it is always possible to find workers if you pay them enough. Average hourly construction wages are at $28.42 per hour, up 3 percent over the previous year -- the fastest annual increase since 2009, according to Associated General Contractors. Wages for undocumented workers are generally lower, said Simonson, but he didn't have a specific figure. \n \nThe region's construction industry already is in fierce competition with oil and gas producers that can pay much higher than jobs on a construction site. The shortage is so acute that subcontractors already are using unconventional means to find workers. The Central Texas Subcontractor Association is partnering with nonprofit Goodwill Industries to teach skills. Irving, Texas-based Astro Sheet Metal Co. has given up on hiring experienced workers and instead expects to train workers from the ground up. \n \nNationwide, two-thirds of construction firms are having difficulty finding workers, according to an August survey by Associated General Contractors. In Texas, with 1,254 miles of border, 67 percent of builders had trouble finding concrete workers and 63 percent couldn't find enough cement masons, the group found. \n \n\"What happens when an already tight housing industry loses a substantial portion of its labor force to more stringent enforcement of immigration policies, to infrastructure projects, and to possibly build a wall between Mexico and the United States?\" said Mark Boud of San Clemente, Calif., who is chief economist for real-estate research firm Metrostudy. \"Labor shortages and rising labor costs which already plague the housing market will be magnified, and residential construction costs may surge.\" \n \nMarek said his firm, which operates throughout Texas and focuses on interior work, has been turning down jobs because it can't find enough skilled, legal labor. He said a solution would be a guest worker visa program or giving legal status to immigrants already in the country. \n \nMuch has changed for builders since the 18-month Great Recession, which ended in 2009. As unemployment among construction workers topped 27 percent and the housing recovery trailed that of other industries, 2.3 million workers lost their jobs and many left the profession for good. \n \nYounger workers were deterred from entering, and many contractors and subcontractors closed. Combine that shrinking labor market with a booming housing market and you have the perfect recipe for a labor shortage. Unemployment in the construction sector dropped to 4.5 percent over the summer, the lowest level in a decade. \n \nThe number of illegal immigrants in the United States has been falling since the 2008 recession, partly because of the housing crash and loss of construction jobs, and also because of an improving economy in Mexico. There were 11.1 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2014, the most recent data available, according to the Pew Research Center. \n \nThe cohort of unauthorized construction workers declined to 1.2 million in 2012, down 23 percent from five years earlier, Pew said. Central Americans recently fleeing gang violence and seeking asylum in the United States tend to be less skilled in construction than Mexicans. While building a wall is less complex than a skyscraper, it would still take workers with skills in areas such as carpentry, concrete forming and tie wiring. \n \nStill, young people think \"swinging a hammer\" is for unaccomplished people, said Wendy Lambert, executive director of the Central Texas Subcontractor Association, a stereotype she says is unwarranted.

But he is our fourth consecutive leader to assume the office with a segment of the electorate questioning his legitimacy. On that score, Trump doesn't represent a new crisis for American democracy, but rather an escalation of one that's been building, one that we've all played a role in creating and that he has deftly exploited to his advantage. \n \nWe used to argue over whether new presidents had a \"mandate,\" which was a more polite way of raising the legitimacy question. After the 1992 election, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said president-elect Bill Clinton did not have a mandate to press ahead with any sweeping changes because he'd obtained only 43 percent of the popular vote in a three-way race. Republicans convinced themselves that third-party candidate Ross Perot had cost them the election, taking more votes away from George H.W. Bush than from Clinton. They were quick to accuse Clinton in his first year of liberal overreach for pressing to allow gays in the military, raising energy taxes, and taking on an ambitious overhaul of the health-care system. Anger among conservatives that Clinton would illegitimately (in their view) push such an agenda led to the so-called Gingrich Revolution in 1994. It fed any number of conspiracy theories and led Republicans to gleefully pursue Clinton's impeachment during his second term. \n \nThen in 2000 came one of the more contentious presidential elections in U.S. history, not because of the substance of the campaign between Al Gore and George W. Bush, two amiable and seemingly moderate candidates, but because the result was too close to call for weeks. It took a Supreme Court intervention to put an end to the indecision. Compounding the muddled nature of the outcome, Bush obtained half a million fewer votes in the popular count nationwide. Some members of the Congressional Black Caucus (including Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, who forcefully questioned Trump's legitimacy recently) refused to attend the inauguration. I can remember all the debates then among fellow journalists and friends about either the necessity or the peril of \"normalizing\" such an abnormal, unsatisfying result with a \"normal\" inauguration and all the other trappings afforded an incoming president. \n \nWe tend to forget the extent to which #notmypresident could have been a trending hashtag in those early Bush days--if hashtags had been around--because everything would soon change, on Sept. 11, 2001. After the terrorist attacks Americans rallied around their president, as we always tend to do in wartime, and the grousing about his legitimacy or mandate stopped. But a few years later, with mounting disillusionment over open-ended military campaigns abroad and a sense that the administration had launched the Iraq invasion on false pretenses, millions of Americans once again began to question not only Bush's judgment but also his legitimacy. None other than New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump called for Bush's impeachment. \n \nThe impulse to disqualify rather than merely debate leaders we don't agree with intensified in the late 2000s. There was no disputing the mandate conferred upon Barack Obama by his resounding 2008 win, so the questioning of our first African American president's legitimacy swirled around the underhanded, racially motivated and absurd allegations--peddled by our current president, among others--that Obama wasn't a natural-born citizen. Newt Gingrich spoke for many in 2010 when he accused the president of being beyond the American mainstream, pursuing instead a \"Kenyan, anti-colonial\" worldview. \n \nGiven our propensity to question the legitimacy of leaders we don't agree with, it's hardly surprising Lewis and others questioned Trump's legitimacy. The tenor of his public rhetoric and behavior; his considerable 3 million-vote deficit in the popular vote; the FBI director's erratic intervention, now under investigation, in the final days of the campaign; and the Russian government's attempts to influence the outcome in Trump's favor provide fodder for those inclined to dismiss a president they oppose. \n \nWhat is it about the past three presidencies that helped bring us to this moment? That question will no doubt inspire many dissertations in the coming decades, but one obvious similarity is that the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, unlike those that came before them, had to navigate in a political environment shaped by the close of the Cold War, the rise of instantaneous doomsday-style political fundraising, the emergence of a highly balkanized and ubiquitous 24/7 media, and the disruption of traditional politics by the Internet and social media. \n \nThese are somewhat familiar and overlapping themes, though we often make a glaring omission in how we talk about them. With the end of the Cold War and its threat of nuclear annihilation, the stakes seemed lower, as did our need to defer to presidents on foreign policy or anything else (the two years after 9/11 were a reversion to Cold War days in terms of how opponents dealt with Bush). The flood of money into politics--money that could be raised easily by groups other than the traditional political parties, at the click of a button--encouraged a rhetorical arms race of dystopian depictions of what had become of Washington. It is much easier to get people to send you $20 if you accuse the president of being a threat to the American way of life instead of an honorable man with whom you happen to disagree on a certain topic. And we're all familiar with how changes in media in this age of 24/7 cable news (Fox News launched in 1996 to challenge the cautious objectivity of CNN) and of infinite online opinions have helped poison, and add a frenzied quality to, political coverage and discourse. \n \nThe omission in how we talk about the hyperbole in our politics and civic life is that we conveniently take ourselves out of the picture. We talk about all this with detached regret, as victims of distant politicians' antics, when we are in fact protagonists in this tale, helping to determine the tenor of our politics. The Internet and social media have engaged millions of Americans in politics more directly than ever before, and the results haven't been pretty. \n \nIf you're passionate about politics and follow it closely, think about how people in your circles have talked about the past few presidents at the dinner table or online. I can recall conservative friends back in the 1990s calling Clinton (the free-trading, bank-deregulating, Serbia-bombing Democrat) a socialist, and then being surrounded by friends calling Bush (the pro-immigration, Medicare-expanding, Muslim-embracing Republican) a fascist. And the zealous, irrational epithets only ratcheted up from there. Obama was often called a socialist or a Bolshevik even as he disappointed his most ardent supporters by coming to Wall Street's rescue during the financial crisis. By the time the 2016 presidential campaign was underway, neither Democrats nor Republicans retained enough credibility in sounding the alarm about Trump being outside the mainstream; they had cried wolf too many times. \n \nThis has left us with President Donald Trump, a leader befitting our own hyperbole. It's convenient to talk about the Trump phenomenon as if it were an errant asteroid hitting Washington, destroying our harmonious politics out of the blue, but also dishonest. \n \nIt's desirable, and quintessentially American, to strenuously oppose policies and ideas we disagree with. But the haste of recent years to delegitimize opponents, and to call them un-American, is itself un-American. It leaves us with a bankrupt, even illegitimate, politics devoid of shared narratives, aspirations, values and, increasingly, facts. \n \nAndres Martinez teaches journalism at Arizona State University. \n \nEditorial on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANDRES MARTINEZ Washington Post"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Hyperbole","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202405846","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Ulrich recommends booking everything, from parking to shore excursions to character experiences, as early as possible. \n \n\u2022 Get trip insurance. \n \n\u2022 Consider booking through a travel agent. Booking through a travel agent typically costs no more than booking directly through Disney \u2014 Ulrich\u2019s services are complimentary with any booked vacation, for example \u2014 and can save you money because the agents will use their firsthand knowledge to tailor a trip that includes only what you want. \n \n\u2022 For more information, visit disneycruise.disney.go.com. \n  \nI was, as I kept telling people, \"not a cruise person\" and \"not a Disney person\" -- I was also sometimes a seasick person -- but as I settled into my stateroom with my 8- and 5-year-old daughters, I realized I couldn't have been more excited to cast off into the abyss. \n \nI decided our four-night cruise to Cozumel, Mexico, and back would be an unplugged vacation, buying only enough Wi-Fi to send occasional proof-of-life check-ins to my husband. Otherwise, we would trade FaceTime for face time with Mickey and Minnie, iPads for plunges in the pool and status updates for sunrises from the balcony of our room. \n \nAs it turned out, it was an ideal time to discover the Wonder, which itself had just returned relaxed and rejuvenated from early fall dry dock in Spain \n \nand was eager to show off its recent renovations and enhancements. \n \nBE OUR GUEST \n \nAs we entered the lobby for our cruise, a crew member quietly asked me for our last name, then grandly announced us to the room. My daughters were awestruck by our celebrity-style entrance, then even more awestruck by the name of the group -- the Burger family -- announced after us. \n \nIt was the first in a series of personal touches that made an impression during our trip, from pink robes in each of the girls' sizes hanging in the closet of our stateroom to their favorite drinks waiting each night at our dinner table. \n \nDisney cruises can be more expensive than other lines -- current pricing on disneycruise.disney.go.com starts at $2,900 for a four-night cruise out of Galveston for two adults and two children, about twice a Carnival cruise for the same route -- and like other lines are largely all-inclusive aside from things such as alcoholic beverages, spa treatments and shore excursions. Included in the price, said Melissa Ulrich, owner of the Austin, Texas-based Disney-centered travel agency Trips to the Mouse, who also sailed on the newly renovated ship in November, is a higher level of service than some other lines deliver. \n \n\"I feel like the cast members really know who you are,\" Ulrich said. \"They get to know you, and they also remember you if you come back to the Wonder. They see people all the time, different faces, but they can remember that you like this cuisine and you liked this beverage.\" \n \nA WHOLE NEW WORLD \n \nYou may think you know the movie Toy Story , but until you've climbed 13 huge primary-colored steps to the top of Andy's gigantic bed, then twisted-and-turned your way back down on an enormous slide, you haven't truly experienced it. \n \nThe huge-scale reproduction of Andy's room -- complete with an adult-height Mr. Potato Head -- is one of the new post-dry-dock additions to the Disney Wonder's Oceaneer kids club, which also now includes a life-size re-creation of Wandering Oaken's Trading Post from Frozen , a Club Disney Junior area that features visits from Doc McStuffins and Sofia the First and a Marvel Super Hero Academy. \n \nIn addition to the revamped kids' offerings, our sailing also included the debut of the new Frozen, A Musical Spectacular inside the 977-seat Walt Disney Theatre. I figured the 55-minute show would be little more than an easy way for families to fill an evening hour until I read up on the creative team, which includes a host of Tony Award-winners and -nominees including director Sheryl Kaller and costume designer Paloma Young. \n \n\"This show is loved and revered by so many people, and it's so perfect for a cruise ship insomuch that we have such a wide range of age groups and also boys and girls on board the ship,\" said Jim Urry, vice president of entertainment for Disney Cruise Line, on the day the show debuted. \"This show really does read well to the entire family. It felt like a perfect show for our ship and our demographic.\" \n \nAs the show started, I was surprised to see that it incorporated not only Broadway-style theater but technology and puppetry as well. \n \n\"Should I be looking at the puppet or the singer?\" my 8-year-old whispered as cast members began acting out the roles of young Anna and Elsa using puppets. There were plenty of things that I liked about the show, but seeing the girls react to all of its little details -- from the puppets to the \"snow\" that fell from the ceiling during Elsa's icy blasts -- was my favorite part. \n \n\"I love to watch the children in the audience watching a show for the first time and you see the eyes of the parents realizing the delight on the kid's face,\" Urry said. \"That happens in the dining experiences, in the atrium experiences. Everything on board the ship is for every age group, either by that age group taking part or being observed by the other members of the family. You will never be bored on one of these ships.\" \n \nA SPOONFUL OF SUGAR \n \nWhy watch cartoons during dinner when you can make the cartoons yourself? \n \nAt Animator's Palate, one of the restaurants aboard the Disney Wonder, you won't receive so much as a piece of bread until you and all the members of your group have thoughtfully drawn a character of your choosing on the paper placed in front of your seat. \n \nWe obliged, ordered dinner and kind of forgot about our drawings until a video set to the tune of \"Friend Like Me\" from Aladdin started playing near our table. Featured in the video was each of our characters, brought to life and dancing, marching and even ice skating across the screen with the likes of beloved figures Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio and Snow White. \n \nIn the time it takes to eat a serving of macaroni, we had become bona fide animators -- our names were even featured in the credits. \n \nOne of the things that kept me from wanting to take a cruise was my assumption that mealtime would be filled with forced conversation and bland food, but night after night we received a table to ourselves and enjoyed dinners that were tasty in an atmosphere that was fun. \n \nNo place was more fun than Tiana's Place, which opened for the first time on our sailing and was inspired by 2009's The Princess and the Frog . The restaurant intends to evoke the feel of a New Orleans supper club and mostly succeeds, from the Crawfish Crooners band playing \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" onstage to classic Louisiana cuisine served with just the right amount of kick. But it's the details -- Tiana's family photos and culinary awards framed on the wall, for example -- that really make it feel special. \n \n\"We have a great tradition of taking our Disney stories and making them become a reality in our restaurants. Tiana's Place is exactly that,\" said Ozer Balli, vice president of hotel operations for Disney Cruise Lines. \"Tiana lives in this restaurant. Her dreams come true.\" \n \nFOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER \n \nWhile waiting in line to snap a photo with Minnie, my daughters hit it off with another little girl and became instantly inseparable, begging me to coordinate visits to the kids club with her parents. \n \nWhat did that mean for me? More time than expected to discover the adult spaces of the ship, for one. \n \nOne \"adult district\" features three bars, including the new Crown & Fin English Pub, which, with its dark brown decor, leather seats and brass accents, really was reminiscent of pubs I've visited in London. It also has plenty of TVs for sports fans and fun details for Disney fans. \n \n\"We looked at all of the different stories we've told on film that take place throughout Great Britain and tried to put little props all throughout,\" said Theron Skees, portfolio creative executive for Walt Disney Imagineering. When you enter, for example, keep an eye out for Mary Poppins' umbrella. \n \nI started my afternoon alone with a day pass for the \"rainforest room,\" located next to the just-renovated Senses Spa, where heated chairs and steamy showers provided instant relaxation. Next I went for a soak in the adults-only Quiet Cove hot tub, followed by dinner at Palo, an upscale adults-only Italian restaurant that comes with a dress code and dining upcharge. \n \nAs I sat twisting forkfuls of fat pappardelle topped with succulent lobster and sipping pinot noir while staring out at the ocean, I realized it was the first time in, well, forever that I had enjoyed a relaxed, unplugged evening. The highlight was dessert -- a decadent made-to-order chocolate souffle drenched in vanilla bean and chocolate sauces. \n \nBIBBIDI-BOBBIDI-BOO \n \nGoing into the cruise, I had no expectations, but there really were magical moments sprinkled throughout. \n \nBeing unplugged meant there was no squabbling over the iPad -- although there was a little squabbling over the in-room TV, where channels feature every Disney movie and TV show you could possibly want to watch -- and also more time to pay attention to these moments as they happened. \n \nI savored afternoons like the one we spent at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, a new shop where dresses from all the princesses in Disney's stable hang around the room, creating a rainbow-kaleidoscope wall framed by sparkling accessories. Watching the girls' jaws drop -- not from behind an Instagram filter but up close and personal, every individual piece of glitter twinkling -- as they saw that they had been transformed into Tinker Bell and Princess Jasmine was just as special for me as it was for them. \n \nUnlike my bad mood as I entered the ship, I got off feeling relaxed and happy. \n \nI never thought a brand as pervasive as Disney would inspire me to unplug, but I'm grateful that it did. \n \nTravel on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"KRISTIN FINAN Austin American-Statesman"},"topics":[],"title":"Waves of Wonder","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-wonder9_14-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585","http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-wonder4_10-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585","http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-travel_cru-disney-wonder_au_99-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585"],"sequenceId":"695202405930","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:52Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-wonder8_98-22506.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

Admirers and critics alike know she was more consequential than that. Barack Obama was America's first black president, which is a huge thing and a fine thing. But when you've said that, you've probably said what matters most about his time in office. \n \nPerhaps it was harder--less probable--for a black man with little experience of government to be elected president of the U.S. in 2008 than it was for a woman to lead the British Conservative Party to electoral victory in 1979. Obama's rise to the presidency was a remarkable accomplishment. Talk about audacity. But reflecting on his eight years in office, one wonders how much ambition he had left after that. \n \nHe doubtless wanted to succeed, and he did, in some ways. Not least, he won re-election in 2012 and departs the White House with most voters thinking well of him. But already in 2008 he could say and think, \"Yes we did.\" Nothing he achieved afterward eclipses that. Thatcher, in contrast, betrayed little or no interest in defeating a prejudice about what women could aspire to be. She wanted power because she believed it was necessary to transform Britain, and nobody else was up to the job. For good or ill, transform Britain is what she did. \n \nA prime minister with a comfortable majority in Parliament has more power to change Britain than any president has to change the U.S. No checks and balances to deal with. Yet you could argue that Ronald Reagan managed it. Obama, you could also argue, might have managed it too, had he tried. The occasion presented itself in the form of an economic crisis. Leaders subsequently deemed great usually find themselves contending with a crisis, domestic or foreign, sometimes of their own making. But Obama let his particular crisis go to waste. \n \nWhat nonsense, Obama's admirers will say: His stimulus bill saved the U.S. from a new Great Depression; his health-care reform was a decisive and (despite the Republicans' forthcoming efforts) irreversible advance; he used his executive powers to shift policy across a wide range of issues, from climate change to national security. Take all that together, and his legacy is indeed a country transformed. \n \nAll of this is very questionable. The recession would certainly have been worse without the stimulus, and the stimulus might have been smaller without Obama's input, but modern economies with huge public sectors and forceful central banks aren't vulnerable to depression in the way countries were in the 1920s and 1930s. Britain's economy fell further in the slump, but its subsequent recovery has been about as strong as America's, for the most part with a fiscally orthodox Conservative government in charge. \n \nWe'll see what remains of the Affordable Care Act in due course, but its prospects aren't helped by its unpopularity from the outset. Some argue that Obamacare established access to health care as a right, and from this at least there's no going back. Actually, it failed to establish that idea. Obamacare reduced the number of uninsured Americans, which is progress, but not to zero. \n \nAs for the rest, what executive actions can do, executive actions can undo. On race relations, hopes were high that Obama would mark a decisive break with the past; if anything, the divisions are deeper than before. Even Obama's most fawning admirers rarely call his foreign policy a success. China is throwing its weight around. So is Russia. Iran's nuclear ambitions are only on pause, the Middle East is in turmoil, and Syria has fallen into an abyss at the hands of a corrupt government and its Russian sponsor. \n \nIn every case, Obama has good excuses. In foreign policy, he followed a president whose own bid for greatness, the war on Iraq, ended in catastrophe. An unassertive foreign policy, if not outright disengagement, is what many Americans wanted from the new president. Obama soon recognized the limits of that approach, but he was stuck with the country's suspicion of forceful leadership in global affairs. \n \nIn domestic policy, Obama had to cope with a Congress crippled by polarization. Republicans were soon in a position to block every legislative initiative, and did so remorselessly. Obamacare was a centrist initiative, but Congress no longer had a center to get behind it. It passed without a single Republican vote, and despite the reservations of many leftist Democrats. It was a narrowly partisan victory that failed to impress even the winners. \n \nFar-reaching reform requires consensus; lacking consensus, it fails to stick. Obama thought the ACA would create a consensus all by itself, after the fact. So far, it hasn't. \n \nMany politicians make the mistake of thinking that consensus requires timidity. Thatcher was abrasive and radical, and aroused ferocious opposition--but her assault on a trade-union movement run amok commanded wide support. Thatcherism moved the center of British politics to the right, and the shift persisted. Subsequent Labour and Tory governments have nestled closely together in this repositioned middle. Thatcher changed Britain by changing British politics. \n \nCould Obama have aspired to something similar in the U.S.--repopulating the political center and aligning it leftward, behind a new New Deal built on American capitalism but addressed to growing inequality and diminished economic security? \n \nIn 2008 it seemed possible. The new president was a man of enormous talent, effortlessly commanding respect, an enthralling speaker, calm, sober and instantly likable. He'd come up from nothing, and by the way, he was black. He was something entirely new, yet quintessentially American. The country, it seemed, was proud of him and proud of itself for having produced him. The politically uncommitted wanted him to succeed, and despite later controversies and disappointments this never really changed. \n \nIt would be wrong to say he squandered these assets, but he took no chances with them. You don't realign politics by tending exclusively to the hopes and ideas of your partisan followers. That's what he did. As president, Obama was most comfortable preaching to the converted. \n \nHe rarely challenged the left, or spoke to the movable center of the electorate on terms of full understanding and respect. When it came to selling Obamacare, for instance, he was strangely passive. His characteristic approach was to apologize to Democrats for compromises fashioned elsewhere--regrettable compromises, required by practical politics--while expressing empathy for the benighted and unconvinced, clinging to their mistaken beliefs for perfectly understandable reasons. This approach is guaranteed to change nobody's mind. \n \nRead his farewell address. It was a good speech, like almost all his speeches. But it was addressed mostly to his supporters--\"Yes we did\"--not to America. Obama accepted the country's political divisions as given, and risked nothing on changing them. \n \nCompounding the problem, he had no taste for transactional politics. He entrenched polarization by choosing not to elicit latent demand for a new center, yet was disdainful of the tawdry deal-making that this lack of ambition made necessary. Grand political realignment was not his thing. Cutting deals, better left to other people, was not his thing either. \n \nGreat leadership--more precisely, the desire to be a great leader--can be dangerous. Remember that Thatcher could easily have been a great failure: She bet her premiership and the lives of many soldiers and sailors on a stupid war with Argentina, a reckless venture that on any rational analysis was likely to fail. She had to be outrageously lucky as well as ambitious. Don't be too quick to blame Obama for his caution. \n \nAnd yet it's disappointing. America's polarization and the deep political dysfunction that flows from it are themselves a kind of crisis. Now they've yielded President Trump, and who knows what harm will flow from that? If Obama had been willing to think big and take risks--not just before getting elected but afterward as well--things might have been different. But Obama wasn't that man. \n \nEditorial on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CLIVE CROOK Bloomberg"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Obama's failing: lack of ambition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202407386","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"York","zipCode":"29730","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Rock Hill","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rock Hill Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657448","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1027"},"name":"Rock Hill Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202410832","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

New research, however, may have found a drug that can inhibit the protein driving its growth. Researchers may have found a way to inhibit the growth of brain tumors, here shown in an MRI scan. Glioblastomas are tumors that form out of the \"sticky,\" supportive tissue of the brain and spinal cord. \n\nMost of the time, glioblastomas are aggressive malignant; they are made of many different types of cells that reproduce very quickly and receive a significant blood supply. The 5-year survival rate is estimated to be less than 10 percent. \n\nGlioblastoma can be difficult to treat because of the heterogenous nature of its cells. Some of the cells may respond to therapy while others may not. \n\nTypically, treatment includes a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. So far, this has resulted in a median survival of about 2 to 3 years for patients receiving standard treatment. \n\nPatients with more severe forms of glioblastoma, who receive a combination of drugs and radiation therapy, usually survive for an average of 14.6 months, and the 2-year survival rate is approximately 30 percent. Little can be done to treat recurrent glioblastoma. \n\nIn this context, more and more researchers are exploring genetic options for treatment. Recent studies have pointed to mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes as the key driver of glioblastoma, but clinical trials aimed specifically at neutralizing these driver mutations were not successful in treating this form of cancer. \n\nHowever, researchers from the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute and Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center may have found a way to inhibit glioblastoma cells. \n\nTheir findings were published in the journal Cell Reports. \n\nThe team - co-led by Dr. Robert Bachoo, of the Annette G. Strauss Center for Neuro-Oncology at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and Dr. Ralf Kittler, an assistant professor of pharmacology in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development - successfully used a drug to target different proteins that drive the growth of glioblastoma tumors. \n\nMithramycin inhibits glioblastoma-driving transcription factors \n\nThe new study suggests that so far, researchers have mistakenly focused on RTK gene mutations, which are only responsible for starting tumor growth, not for the continued growth of glioblastoma. \n\n\"Our work shows that the gene mutations which the pharmaceutical industry and clinicians have been focusing on are essential only for starting tumor growth. Once the tumor has advanced to the stage where patients seek treatment, these mutations are no longer required for continued tumor growth; they are in effect redundant,\" explains co-senior author Dr. Bachoo. \n\nInstead of the RTK genes, the new study found three transcription factors to be responsible for glioblastoma: Sox2, Olig2, and Zeb1. As co-senior author Dr. Kittler explains, the study shows that these \"neurodevelopmental transcription factors (master proteins that regulate the activity of hundreds of genes during normal brain development) are reactivated to drive the growth of glioblastoma.\" \n\nIn their study, Dr. Kittler, Dr. Bachoo, and team found the drug mithramycin to inhibit these transcription factors. \"We can inhibit these transcription factors and prevent further tumor growth with the chemotherapy drug mithramycin, a drug that has not been in clinical use for years due to its side effects. Our discovery has the potential for the development of a new therapy that may increase survival time for glioblastoma patients.\" \n\nDr. Ralf Kittler\n\n\"These findings change our fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of glioblastoma, and how to treat it,\" adds Dr. Bachoo. \"We may have identified a set of critical genes we can target with drugs that are shared across nearly all glioblastomas.\" \n\nHowever, the scientists warn that mithramycin may cause liver toxicity in a number of patients, and that repurposing the drug to treat glioblastoma could take several years. \n\nLearn how cancer may not mainly be down to 'bad luck'.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Medical News Today"},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"Scientists inhibit brain tumor cell growth, p...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","HealthCare"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.abta.org/brain-tumor-information/types-of-tumors/glioblastoma.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/","https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article/15/1/4/1373604/Standards-of-care-for-treatment-of-recurrent","http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(13)01208-7","http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)31771-5"],"sequenceId":"695202423411","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/0234e8f26f61e15960283c840b382240.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The new study, however, shows that this is not the case - it can actually have serious consequences for health. \n\nMetabolic syndrome risk tripled by self-stigma \n\nThe research involved 159 adults aged between 21 and 65 who had a body mass index (BMI) of 33 or higher, which is classed as obese. The majority of participants were African-American, a population the researchers say is often underrepresented in weight bias studies. \n\nAll participants were a part of a larger weight loss study, in which they completed the Weight Bias Internalization Scale - a measure of the extent to which individuals apply weight stereotypes to themselves. \n\nSubjects also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire, which the team used to determine participants' criteria for depression and metabolic syndrome. \n\nMetabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems. These risk factors include high blood pressure, a large waist circumference, high fasting blood sugar, and a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. \n\nA total of 51 subjects (32.1 percent) met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, the team reports. \n\nCompared with participants who had low levels of weight bias internalization, those with high levels of internalized weight bias were found to be at a three times greater risk of metabolic syndrome. \n\nSubjects with high weight bias internalization were also six times more likely to have high triglyceride levels, which can lead to atherosclerosis, which is a buildup of fatty substances in the wall of the arteries that can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. \n\nThese results remained after controlling for BMI and depression. \n\nWeight bias internalization may fuel unhealthful behavior \n\nWhile this study was unable to pinpoint why participants with high internalized weight bias were more likely to have metabolic syndrome, they point to previous research that suggests such bias is likely to prompt unhealthful behaviors. \n\n\"The act of self-stigmatizing may lead to a state of physiological arousal that itself increases risk for metabolic abnormalities through biological pathways (e.g., cortisol secretion). This state of physiological and affective stress may also lead individuals to cope by eating unhealthy food or binge eating,\" the authors explain. \n\n\"Additionally, individuals with high WBI [weight bias internalization] exhibit diminished self-efficacy to exercise due to endorsing negative stereotypes, such as laziness, and thus are more likely to avoid physical activity,\" they add. \n\nOverall, the researchers believe that their findings thwart the common belief that body shaming can help to improve the lifestyle of people who are overweight or obese. \n\n\"Healthcare providers, the media, and the general public should be aware that blaming and shaming patients with obesity is not an effective tool for promoting weight loss, and it may in fact contribute to poor health if patients internalize these prejudicial messages. \n\nProviders can play a critical role in decreasing this internalization by treating patients with respect, discussing weight with sensitivity and without judgment, and giving support and encouragement to patients who struggle with weight management - behaviors everyone should display when interacting with people with obesity.\"\n\nStudy co-author Tom Wadden, Ph.D., Center for Weight and Eating Disorders\n\nLearn how blue corn might help to combat metabolic syndrome.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Medical News Today"},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"Obesity: Self-stigma may raise risk of metabo...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","HealthCare"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.21716/full","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866597/","https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ms"],"sequenceId":"695202423584","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/7e73b12b8b802f7f9be179443af21017.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Games were taking less time than Rafa takes picking at his undies.\n\nTHE EFFIN' COMEBACK\n\nEff me if she didn't f'n make the f'n semis. FFS. Lucic-Baroni delivered the most candid on court post-match interview making her first quarter final in twenty years.\n\nAsked how she persisted for so long against so many obstacles she replied: \"Eff everything and everybody whoever tells you you can't do it. Just show up and win in your heart.\"\n\nShe then won her next match and this time tearfully hinted more at the back story for why the woman dubbed the next Steffi Graf had not realised that potential for 20 years.\n\nTWEET TWEET\n\nRoger does everything the best, even tweets. Federer tweeted a video of his new boy band \u2013 him, Gregor Dimitrov and Tommy Haas - singing \"How to say I'm Sorry\".\n\nALL ADVICE WELCOME, NOT HEEDED \n\nIf losing after imploding on the court wasn't enough Mark Philippoussis giving career advice on how to right his career has to be Nick Kyrgios' penny drop moment.\n\nHis meltdown loss to Andreas Seppi came after being up two sets to one and a break. Afterwards he admitted, finally, that hey being the only player in the top 100 without a coach might not be the smartest move.\n\nWHO ARE YOU WEARING?\n\nEven Daria 'Dasha' Gavrilova did a double take when she appeared on court against Timea Bacsinszky wearing identical outfits.\n\n\"It's a bit weird, but what can we do?,\" she said.\n\nIt sent social media buzzing in the way only the truly irrelevant can and was only outdone by Mirka Federer's jumper choice - a pink and green Gucci number with the words L'aveugle par amour, (\"blind love\", or \"blinded by love\") written on it. Big in central europe but not so pleasing to tennis fans it seems.\n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT?\"\n\nThings got testy on court between bustling Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka who is ordinarily as deadpan as a fondue bowl.\n\nTsonga muttered about Wawrinka giving him greasy looks.\n\n\"I looked at you when? Did I look at you at all? It's a tennis match. You've got to calm down, relax a bit.\" Wawrinka protested quite reasonably.\n\n\"There's no worries,\" Tsonga said. But plainly there is.\n\nThe pair both live in Switzerland and had been close but things went awry a few years ago after Stan's first slam when Tsonga was quoted in L'Equipe saying \"If Stan can win a slam, then I deserve one too\". And with that we bid adieu to Australian Open 2017. Welcome back next year when Pat Rafter and Pete Sampras are favourites to play in the final on a green court.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michael Gleeson"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The hits and misses of the tournament","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Melbourne Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169652301","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3545"},"name":"Melbourne Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theage.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202423982","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I say that it is closer to the truth to say that the media made him. Even my remark is only a partial truth.   \n \nThe media made Trump in at least two ways .First, the media made him a celebrity through his TV shows, gave him national name recognition, one of the things most necessary to get someone elected. Second, the media gave him \"yuuuge\" amounts of publicity. Okay, maybe he earned that publicity by talking dirty and using glittering generalities, a well known ploy in advertising, as well as gloom and doom generalities. He said that blacks were living in hell and asked what they had to lose. \n \nOther propaganda techniques he used included the plain folks appeal and scapegoating. We know what historical figure blamed all problems on the Jews. Trump blamed them on the media.

Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the White House, said: \"Nothing in the Brooklyn judge's order in anyway impedes or prevents the implementation of the president's executive order which remains in full, complete and total effect.\" \n \nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York issued the emergency order after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n \nThe judge's order addressed only a portion of Trump's executive action. As the decision was announced, cheers broke out in crowds of demonstrators who had gathered at American airports and outside the Brooklyn courthouse where the ruling was issued. \n \nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n \nIt was unclear how quickly the judge's order might affect people in detention, or whether it would allow others to resume flying. The White House said the court ruling affected a small number of people who had boarded planes before the White House order was issued. \n \nHomeland Security said those travelers \"were inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented. These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders.\" \n \nBut the detention of the travelers caused a great deal of confusion. \n \n\"Realistically, we don't even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes,\" said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt. \"This order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach U.S. soil.\" \n \nUnder Trump's order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas. However, an official with the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday night that no green-card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump's order had been prevented from entering the U.S. \n \nSome foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday had been detained at U.S. airports, told they were no longer welcome. The DHS official who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas. \n \nIn her three-page order, Donnelly wrote that without the stay \"there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders and other individuals from nations subject to the Jan. 27, 2017, executive order.\" \n \nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. \n \nTrump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \nThe directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the September 11 hijackers. \n \nAs a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the U.S., then said he would implement \"extreme vetting\" for people from countries with significant terror concerns. He told reporters Saturday the order is \"not a Muslim ban.\" \n \n\"It's working out very nicely,\" Trump said of the implementation of his order. \"We're going to have a very, very strict ban and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\" \n \nThe order sparked protests at several of the nation's international airports, including New York's Kennedy and Chicago's O'Hare and facilities in Minneapolis and Dallas-Fort Worth. In San Francisco, hundreds blocked the street outside the arrival area of the international terminal. Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \"Portland Coffee Is From Yemen\" and chanting anti-Trump slogans. U.S. lawmakers and officials around the globe also criticized the move. \n \nTwo of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the U.S. military. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York's Kennedy airport Friday night. Both had been released by Saturday night after their lawyers intervened. \n \nThe government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied. \n \nDiplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump's order would still be allowed into the U.S. \n \nThose already in the U.S. with a visa or green card would be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nTrump's order also directed U.S. officials to review information as needed to fully vet foreigners asking to come to the U.S. and draft a list of countries that don't provide that information. That left open the possibility that citizens of other countries could also face a travel ban. \n \nThe U.S. may still admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government would continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" \n \nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of Trump's order. \n \n\"There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\" said Lena F. Masri, the group's national litigation director. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\" \n \nJohn Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations, said the order didn't address America's \"primary terrorism-related threat\" - people already in the U.S. who become inspired by what they see on the internet. \n \nTrump's order drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program, particularly for those from Syria. \n \nIt is unclear how many people would be immediately impacted by the non-refugee travel ban. According to the statistics maintained by the Homeland Security Department, about 17,000 students from the seven designated countries were allowed into the U.S. for the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015 more than 86,000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. on other, non-immigrant visas and more than 52,000 others became legal permanent residents. \n \nIn 2016, the U.S. resettled 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice, including more than 12,000 Syrians. Before leaving office President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would accept 110,000 refugees in the coming year, but Trump's order cut that by more than half to 5","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"US judge bars deportations under Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202424937","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 49 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Chatham","zipCode":"31405","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Savannah","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WJCL.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607684195","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WJCL.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wjcl.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202425649","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Two days earlier on the 19 th of Ramadhan, while in the state of the morning ritual prayer in the main mosque of Kufa, he was fatally struck on the head by the poisoned sword of the renegade, Abdur-Rahman Ibn Muljam. He was laid to rest in nearby Najaf, which today is one of the foremost centres of pilgrimage with its golden domed shrine. Imam Ali (AS) as the cousin, ward, son-in-law, and divinely-decreed vicegerent of Prophet Mohammad (SAWA), needs no introduction. His model government of social justice, which no administration anywhere in the world has ever succeeded to match, continues to be an inspiration for the seekers of truth. As the unrivalled master of eloquence and wisdom, his sermons, letters and maxims, have been collected in book forms for more than a millennium and two centuries, with the \u201cNahj al-Balaghah\u201d or Highway of Eloquence, being the most famous. Interestingly, all Sufi or mystical orders trace their origin to his ascetic way of life, while even Sunni Muslims, despite regarding him as the 4th caliph in the order of political succession, consider him to be superior to all and everybody else after Prophet Mohammad (SAWA). \n \n1260 solar years ago, on this day in 757 AD, An Lushan, a general of Sogdian-Turkic ethnicity who had risen in the court of the Tang Emperor of China, and had launched his revolt against Chancellor Yang Guozhong at Yanjing two years earlier in 755 after several years of preparation, was assassinated by his own son, An Qingxu, following which the state of Yan continued to spiral into a turmoil that eventually led to its collapse in 763. The rebellion spanned the reigns of three Tang emperors and involved a wide range of regional powers, including Arab and Persian Muslims, Iranian Sogdian forces, and the pagan Gogturks. The disorder resulted in a huge loss of life and large-scale destruction. It significantly weakened the Tang dynasty at a time when it was all set to defeat the Tibetan Empire, and led to the loss of the western regions. As a matter of fact, the western expansion of the Tang Empire was checked four years earlier in 751 by the victory of the Muslims over a large Chinese army in the Battle of Talas in the Ferghana Valley, following the defection of the Karluk Turks during the midst of the battle. Aan Lushan was given control over the entire area north of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, including garrisons about 164,000 strong. He took advantage of various circumstances, such as popular discontent with an extravagant Tang court, the Iranian-involved Abbasid Rebellion against the Omayyad Dynasty, and eventually the absence of strong troops guarding the palace. In 756, over 22,000 Arab-Iranian Muslims were sent by the Abbasid caliph to aid the Tang. They stayed in China after the war and intermarried with the Hui Chinese \u2013 who are predominantly Muslim till this day. During the rebellion the port of Canton (present day Guangzhou, near the mouth of the South China Sea) was pillaged in 758 by sea-borne Arab and Persian forces. \n \n975 lunar years ago , on this day in 463 AH, the Spanish Muslim scholar, Yousuf ibn Abdullah, popularly known as \u201cIbn al-Abdul-Bir\u201d, passed away at the age of 95 in Shateba \u2013 currently called Xativa. Born in Qortaba, a city in Spain which is called Cordova today. A leading Sunni jurist, he initially adhered to the Zaheri School of jurisprudence founded by the Iranian Dawoud ibn Ali az-Zaheri of Isfahan, but later in life became a follower of the Malekite School. In his work, \u201cal-Ist\u2019aab fi Ma\u2019rifat al-Ashaab\u201d or \u201cThe Comprehensive List of Names of the Companions\u201d, he has considered as a \u2018companion\u2019 any person who even once in life met Prophet Mohammad (blessings of God upon him and his progeny). Nonetheless, he has acknowledged the unrivalled merits of the Prophet\u2019s Ahl al-Bayt or Blessed Household, especially Imam Ali ibn Abi Taleb (AS). His other works include \u201cal-Aql wa\u2019l-Uqala\u201d or Reason and the People of Wisdom, and \u201cal-Qasd wa\u2019l-Umam fî Nasab al-Arab wa\u2019l-Ajam\u201d or Endeavors and the Nations: Genealogies of the Arabs and Non-Arabs. \n \n759 solar years ago, on this 1258 AD, first Mongol invasion of Dai Viet or northern Vietnam occurred resulting in the defeat of the Mongols at the Battle of Dong Bo Dau, and their forcing to withdraw to China. The next two Mongol invasions of Vietnam that occurred in the years 1285 and 1287 also met with failure, but led to the acceptance by the Vietnamese of the Yuan Mongol Khanate of China as the paramount power. \n \n281 solar years ago, on this day in 1736 AD, British philosopher and American political activist, Thomas Paine, was born in Thetford, England, in Norfolk County. In 1774, he migrated to New England in what is now the US, arriving just in time to participate in the rebellion of the 13 American colonies against the British crown. Through his writings, notably \u201cCommon Sense\u201d, an incendiary pamphlet, he advocated independence from Britain. His sixteen \u201cCrisis\u201d papers, published between 1776 and 1783, helped to inspire the colonists during the ordeals of the war. He was an active advocate of the French Revolution as well. In his work \"Rights of Man\", written in reply to Edmund Burke's criticism of the French Revolution, he dismissed monarchy. He opposed slavery and was among the early advocates of social security. In his works, Paine emphasized on faith and monotheism. \n \n197 solar years ago, on this day in 1820 AD, Britain's King George III died insane at Windsor Castle at the age 82, ending a reign that saw the occurrence of both the American and French revolutions. He was succeeded by his son George IV, who as Prince of Wales had been regent for 9 years during his father\u2019s insanity. In 2005 scientists reported high levels of arsenic in the hair of King George III and said the deadly poison might have been the cause of the bouts of apparent madness he suffered during his long 60-year reign that saw the 13 New England colonies rebel against the British crown to form the United States of America (USA), because of his repressive policies. \n \n154 solar years ago, on this day in 1863 AD, the Bear River Massacre took place in present-day Idaho when the United States Army cowardly attacked Amerindian natives of the Shoshone tribe, killing in cold blood over 500 men, women, and children. The Anglo-Saxon aggressors were led by Colonel Patrick Edward Connor, who after killing most of the men and many of the children, ordered his soldiers to assault and rape the women. In some cases, US soldiers held the feet of infants by the heel and brutally beat their brains out on any hard substance they could find. Women who resisted the soldiers were shot and killed. Many soldiers pulled out their pistols and shot several Shoshones at point blank range. The soldiers burned the Shoshone dwellings and supplies; they killed anyone they found in the shelters, as part of the genocide launched by the white-skinned occupiers of America to exterminate the native people. \n \n147 solar years ago, on this day in 1870 AD, was born in Diyarbakr the eminent Ottoman Turkish poet, author and politician, Suleyman Nazif, who authored the two famous articles; that is, a letter to Prophet Jesus against the crusader mentality of Europe and the supposed reply of the Messiah disassociating himself from Christians and their crimes against humanity. Son of poet and historian Sa\u2019eed  Pasha, and brother of renowned poet and politician Faiq Ali Ozansoy, in addition to his native Turkish, Suleyman mastered Arabic, Persian, and French languages. He worked as a civil servant in Diayarbakr. After moving to Istanbul, he started contributing articles to the literary magazine \u201cServet-e Funoun\u201d (\"Wealth of Knowledge\") until it was censored by the government in 1901 for his articles against Sultan Abdul Hamid II and his sympathizing with the ideas of the reformist group \u201cYoung Turks\u201d. He fled to France, where he stayed eight months. When he returned home, he was forced to work at a secretary post in the Governorate of Bursa between 1897 and 1908. In 1908, Suleyman Nazif moved to Istanbul again, joined the Committee of Union and Progress and started journalism. He also co-founded a newspaper \u201cTesvir-e Afkar\u201d (\u201cPicture of Thoughts\u201d), together with the journalist Abu Ziya Tovfiq. Although this newspaper had to close soon, his articles made him a well-known writer. After Sultan Abdul-Hamid restored constitutional monarchy following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, Nazif served as governor of Ottoman provinces Basra (1909), Kastamonu (1910), Trabzon (1911), Mosul (1913) and Baghdad (1914). In 1915 he resigned to continue his profession as a writer. He opposed the Armenian massacre as well as the occupation of Istanbul during World War 1 by the French and British forces. He was exiled to the island of Malta. Twenty months later following the Turkish War of Independence, he returned to Istanbul and continued to write. Nazif, ever critical of the European imperialist powers, attracted once more their hostility when he wrote his famous article \"Hazrat-e Isa'ya Acık Mektup\" (or Open Letter to Prophet Jesus) in which he complained against the crimes perpetrated by Christians. Two weeks later he published \"The Reply of Jesus\" in which he, in the words of Jesus, refuted the charges, saying the Virgin-born Messiah is not responsible for the crimes of Christians or their beliefs. These two letters became widely popular. He died of pneumonia on January 4, 1927. \n \n96 solar years ago, on this day in 1921 AD, the British invaders after crushing the uprising of Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019ite Muslim majority, installed Faisal, the son of Sharif Hussein of Hejaz, as king in Baghdad, as a reward for his treason against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Britain had earlier promised to make Sharif Hussein the Sultan of Arabia, but it switched sides by giving a green signal to its other agent, Abdul-Aziz ibn Saud of Najd, to attack, plunder and desecrate the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and its holy shrines as well as the commercial centres of Jeddah and Ta\u2019ef. Before creating the spurious state of Saudi Arabia for Abdul-Aziz, the crafty British, as part of their divide-and rule policy, first placed Faisal as king in Damascus and created a fake state called Jordan for Sharif Hussein\u2019s another son, Abdullah. The French, who had occupied Syria, opposed the British decision and four months later Faisal was driven out of Damascus. Then, London appointed Faisal as king of Iraq, which he ruled until his death in 1933 and was succeeded by his son Ghazi. In 1958, Ghazi\u2019s son, Faisal II was overthrown and killed in the military coup staged by General Abdul-Karim Qassem, thus ending foreign imposed dynastic rule in Iraq. \n \n91 solar years ago, on this day in 1926 AD, Pakistani physicist and Nobel Prize laureate, Abdus-Salaam, was born in Santokdas in the Sahiwal District of Punjab. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize for Physics with Steven Weinberg and Sheldon Lee Glashow. Each had independently formulated a theory explaining the underlying unity of the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. His hypothetical equations, which demonstrated an underlying relationship between the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force, postulated that the weak force must be transmitted by hitherto-undiscovered particles known as weak vector bosons, or W and Z bosons. Weinberg and Glashow reached a similar conclusion using a different line of reasoning. The existence of the W and Z bosons was eventually verified in 1983 by researchers using particle accelerators at CERN. \n \n75 solar years ago, on this day in 1942 AD, following Iran\u2019s invasion by British and Soviet forces in 1941 in violation of Iran\u2019s neutrality in World War II, a trilateral treaty was signed between the three countries, according to which the Pahlavi regime agreed to put Iran\u2019s ground, air, and sea routes at the disposal of Allied Powers in the war against Germany. Moscow and London pledged to leave Iran, at the most, eight months after termination of World War 2. The occupation of Iran by Britain and the Soviet Union inflicted irreparable damages on this country. After end of World War 2, the crafty British withdrew their troops but controlled the Shah and his regime, while the Soviet Union refused to leave Iran and tried to disintegrate the country by planting puppet regimes in the provinces of Azarbaijan and Kurdistan. The plot, however, failed and the Red Army was forced to leave Iran\u2019s soil. \n \n54 solar years ago, on this day in 1963 AD, American poet, Robert Frost, died at the age of 89. He initially worked as a journalist, but his talent in writing poems led him to publish his first collection of poems in at the age of 20. He won the Pulitzer Literary Prize, four times. \n \n38 solar years ago, on this day in 1979 AD, in the wake of the sit-in of ulema at the Tehran University Mosque, teachers and other strata of the community announced their solidarity and joined the protest against the Pahlavi regime. While the number of strikers rose every moment, Shapour Bakhtiar, the prime minister of the fugitive Shah, was forced to lift the obstructions he had placed at the airports to prevent the return home from exile of the Father of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khomeini (RA). The welcoming committee announced that the beloved leader would arrive in Tehran on February 1, 1979, at 9 a.m. Meanwhile, with the opening of Tehran airport, the US military planes flew the Americans out of Iran. \n \n20 solar years ago, on this day in 1997 AD, the 14-year-old Bahraini martyr, Ali Jawad Sheikh, was born on Sitra Island. On August 31, 2011 after the Fajr or early dawn prayers, the youth while participating in a peaceful protest rally was brutally targeted by forces of the repressive Aal-e Khalifa minority regime and attained martyrdom later in the day in the hospital. The savage way in which the teenager was attacked and killed by the regime shocked the civilized world, and spurred protests in Bahrain. For the past four years, the Persian Gulf island state is in the grip of a peaceful struggle for restoration of the birthrights of the overwhelming majority of people and end to the Aal-e Khalifa dictatorship, which is backed by the Americans, the British, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Scores of people have attained martyrdom in the process. \n \nAS/ME","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Vietnam news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"This Day in History (10-11-1395)","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IR","country":"Iran"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Pars Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590827750","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Pars Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://parstoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202429537","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena\u2019s continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\u201cShe was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\u201d \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\u201cWith all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cOf course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\u201d \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"SRN News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556442915","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"SRN News","dataFormat":"audio","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.srnnews.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202436827","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.srnnews.com/media/2017/01/1485677147635844u5PyOWszQY.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 presidential election Feyi Fawehinmi in this interview with BAYO AKINLOYE says that Buhari should resign\n\nRECENTLY your criticisms against President Muhammadu Buhari and his administration indicate you are against him Why\n\nI supported President Muhammadu Buhari in the last presidential election I actively campaigned for him and donated my money to his campaign If I have turned against him it is since he got into office and based entirely on his government\u2019s policy choices I have nothing personal against him\n\nAt what point exactly did you start losing hope in Buhari and promise of \u2018change\u2019\n\nIt was sometime midway last year It just became clear to me that the government sold one thing during the campaign and were doing another thing entirely upon assumption of power The sheer pointless and needless suffering Nigerians have been put through in the name of discredited ideas and waste-of-time economic policies has been too much to bear For me Nigeria is the point of any support and I consider it a serious mistake on my part to have blindly supported Buhari like I did in 2015 READ ALSO And are you really sorry if you had led some Nigerians during the 2015 presidential election to support Buhari\n\nYes I am I feel like I told people I was a mechanic and then they asked for my opinion on a car they wanted to buy Without opening the engine I simply told them to buy the car based on how the body looked I can\u2019t speak for anyone else but the lesson for me is that no matter how much you dislike someone and want to get rid of them \u2013 and I really disliked Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government \u2013 it is important to always be sceptical even for your own side We did not question Buhari hard enough We should have pressed him harder to force him to make clear commitments and adopt clear positions we wanted before the elections Something like taking six months to appoint ministers was such an irritating and costly waste of time And it came as a surprise to even his supporters But we all gave him the benefit of the doubt We allowed him to get away with too much too easily\n\nThe President has been accused of shielding the corruption of his close aides Do you still think Buhari and his administration has some integrity\n\nAt any rate the Secretary to Government of the Federation Babachir Lawal\u2019s letter which carried his Buhari\u2019s signature is the end of any anti-corruption illusion anyone might still carry about him To have risked his reputation for a man who has not exactly set the world of governance on fire is a double tragedy\n\nDo you think he is sincere and serious about fighting corruption in Nigeria\n\nHe might have the right intentions but it is suffering from the pervasive sickness of Nigeria \u2013 incompetence Money is not really being recovered and cases are either being bungled or progressing very slowly Most of what has been recovered has been real estate and expensive items In this economy it is very difficult to turn those things into money And the longer people get away with not giving up their stolen wealth or their freedom the greater their chances of getting away with it completely This is Nigeria after all\n\nDoes it not bother you that Buhari seems bent on having Ibrahim Magu confirmed as substantive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission despite a Department of State Services\u2019 report on and the Senate\u2019s rejection of Magu\n\nHe clearly likes Ibrahim Magu The President has investigated and found him worthy In the grand scheme of things the fight against corruption is now like garri that has been overcome by water\n\nPeople feel Nigeria\u2019s security agencies are tied to the government\u2019s apron strings Is there anything that can be done to free these agencies of political control\n\nThere are examples we can copy Romania is a good one The anti-corruption agency has been strengthened with good laws and gets a lot of independent foreign funding As a result it has been able to do its job freely You will still need to hire the right person but maybe having independent sources of funding will be a good idea\n\nSome people have said there is no difference between Jonathan and Buhari when it comes to fighting corruption What do you think\n\nThere\u2019s probably a lot less money to steal now Price of crude oil is 50 But it raises an interesting question if people are still stealing the small money available now will they steal more if oil goes to 100 How would Jonathan\u2019s people have coped with half price of crude oil The more important issue for me is this Jonathan failed Nigeria Buhari is failing Nigeria Depending on how Buhari finishes his term he can still overtake Jonathan in the unfortunate stakes\n\nSome have called for the President\u2019s resignation Do you think that is a good idea\n\nCalling for the President\u2019s resignation won\u2019t be a bad idea It is the honourable thing for him to do He is clearly not up to the job that is the fundamental problem with this government\n\nWhat do you think about the Presidency\u2019s communication strategy\n\nI always say that Aso Rock was designed in a way that there are no windows looking outside onto the world It sounds trivial but it says something about how we have designed leadership in Nigeria We have physically isolated our leaders with the way we built the seat of power Maybe one day we will get lucky by having a historically aware president who decides to bring leadership closer to the people Until then I don\u2019t expect anything out of Aso Rock to change","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria

Very good, pleasing day for me and the team. \n \n\"Just a believer that I need to keep doing it every game, and for that, I have been working really hard. I don't take any game lightly. \n \n\"Playing for South Africa is really special. Today is very special because it is my wedding anniversary. My wife asked me to get five wickets and this is absolutely for her. \n \n\"I think I was bowling against the wind which was obviously easier for the batsmen to hit me. But I always look to bowl according to the field. Somehow I get my wickets but I try not to give runs and try and use my variations. \n \n\"It was a great team effort, the fast bowlers started very well and I had a chance to do the job for South Africa, which is an honour for South Africa. \n \n\"Every wicket I take for South Africa, I try to express how much it means to me when I celebrate. I play for a great country and a great team and I want to continue doing it for as long as I can.\" \n \nSri Lanka skipper Tharanga was naturally disappointed: \"I think Chandimal and Mendis had a partnership, but we could never pick up from the two wickets at the start. It's about spinners, the wicket was slow. \n \n\"Our spinners did not control the ball much, lots of areas to improve on the batting and bowling fronts. We have a couple of days to sit together as a team and have a chat about what we can improve. Like I said, both batting and bowling, lots of areas to improve.\" \n \nPrpteas skipper De Villiers on the other hand was thrilled with his return to the helm: \"I thought it was a really good performance. It was a difficult wicket to get used to, low, slow and a bit two-paced. \n \n\"But we used our chances really well, great bowling performance to set it up for our batters. Our new-ball bowlers bowled with a lot of intensity and Immy (Imran Tahir) bowled really well. \n \n\"I have had a few windy games before in my life, so I just relied on my experience from those games and it paid off really well today. There is more than enough time, Russell and I keep talking about plans and there is also Faf to bounce ideas off. \n \n\"It's a tricky total always. It was definitely below-par, I thought 250-260 would have been easy to chase down, but it could still have been tricky. \n \n\"But Quinton and Faf got off to a good start and it set things up nicely for the remaining batters. Easy win today, but we expect them to fight back in the series.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sri Lanka blown away in windy city","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MSN South Africa","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"491300065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1946"},"name":"MSN South Africa","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.msn.com","publisher":"Microsoft Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202437734","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Initially supposed to have the reins up to the end of April this year, he was given a vote of confidence to the end of August instead. \n \nThat gave him the liberty of knowing he would be in charge for the glamour assignments of the ICC Champions Trophy (June) in England and Wales \u2013 another chance for SA to bury the long-time major tournament bogey \u2013 as well as the major, all-formats bilateral combat against the English including four Tests for the Basil D\u2019Oliveira Trophy. \n \nSince the middle of 2016, the revitalised Proteas have accounted for New Zealand in a Test series, clean-swept Australia 5-0 in a home ODI series, beaten the Baggy Greens 2-1 away in Tests, and trounced the \u2018Lankans 3-0 in a home Test series. \n \nIf anything, Domingo seems to have come more into his own than at any prior stage of his tenure at the helm. \n \nBut the statement on Saturday seems to raise at least some doubt about his future status. \n \nAsked for clarification, CSA spokesperson Altaaf Kazi reminded Sport24 that Domingo\u2019s contract did end after the England tour. \n \nPerhaps instructively, he added the word \u201cconfirm\u201d to the earlier CSA statement, saying: \u201cThe process to appoint/confirm a coach post the England tour has begun \u2026 Russell can apply for the position.\u201d \n \nAttempts to establish whether Domingo possibly intended stepping down voluntarily after August had been unsuccessful at the time of writing, with the coach himself preoccupied by his duties in the active ODI at St George\u2019s Park. \n \n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Intrigue surrounds Domingo\u2019s future","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MSN South Africa","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"491300065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1946"},"name":"MSN South Africa","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.msn.com","publisher":"Microsoft Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.sport24.co.za/"],"sequenceId":"695202442031","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

These productions show \n\nLike the society it reflects, Hollywood tilts toward narrow views of black lives, yet it is also always most concerned with what sells. After \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d won a fistful of Oscars in 2014, studios eager for the next great slave epic fought for the rights to \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d about Nat Turner\u2019s 1831 Virginia slave rebellion. Nate Parker, its star and filmmaker, emerged from the Sundance Film Festival last year with a $17.5 million deal, the largest in the event\u2019s history. Parker\u2019s name was expected to dominate this year\u2019s Oscar nominations. The film stiffed. Publicity was upended by Parker\u2019s off-putting answers when asked about a 1999 rape charge, for which he was acquitted in 2001. More tellingly, audiences seemed wary of yet another slave story. There was a sense, especially among some African-Americans, that their culture and experiences should not be reduced time and again on film to subjugation and brutalized black bodies.\n\nAs \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d was failing, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d an unexpected love story, arrived in theaters and became one of the year\u2019s best films. Its lead character is a young black gay male whose sole function isn\u2019t to be a sassy comic foil for a white heroine. (In fact, there are no white characters in the movie.) \n\nIn \u201cFences,\u201d racism skulks around the edges of this film version of the late August Wilson\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, but there\u2019s also a universal quality about how lost dreams can corrode even a well-meaning heart. It\u2019s one of the few recent mainstream films to consider the fragility of family dynamics from a black perspective, something at which Wilson excelled. \u201cHidden Figures\u201d takes an even greater leap with black women at NASA, whose mathematical genius helped put John Glenn in space in 1962. Fighting gender stereotypes is as much a plot line here as race; so often, it\u2019s forgotten that women of color also battle sexism. \n\nStill, while it\u2019s encouraging to see African-Americans earning broader recognition for critically acclaimed work, no three movies can provide full representation of diversity. April Reign, managing editor of BroadwayBlack.com and creator of #OscarsSoWhite, the Twitter hashtag launched in 2015 when no people of color received major nominations, told the Los Angeles Times, \u201c#OscarsSoWhite is about the inclusion of all marginalized communities, both in front of and behind the camera, throughout the entertainment industry.\u201d\n\nReign is correct, and Hollywood executives and Academy voters shouldn\u2019t congratulate themselves too much. Inclusion means opening up the ranks of studio executives, directors, and producers, not just actors and actresses . Yet it also must mean the encouragement and development of stories, both historical and contemporary, communicating depth and diversity in subject matter. With the commercial and critical success of these films certain to be bolstered by their Academy Award nominations, Hollywood may finally embrace the fact that, in communities of color, there are so many more stories to tell. If Hollywood sees that, maybe the rest of the country will, too.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Renée Graham Globe Columnist  January"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Renée Graham: #OscarsALittleBetter","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Boston Globe","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587641","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Boston Globe","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.boston.com","publisher":"New York Times Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202443066","language":"English","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.bostonglobe.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2017/01/26/BostonGlobe.com/Ideas/Images/20151024_Moonlight_D09_C1_K1_0303_rgb.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 48 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cumberland","zipCode":"04101","state":"Maine","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMTW","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"89"},"name":"WMTW","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmtw.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202446776","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

business end of the African Nations Cup 2017 kicked off on Saturday evening with the first quarter final set in the Gabonese capital Libreville A fierce Burkina Faso side took on a technically sound Tunisia The North Africans had surprised everyone as they played an exciting brand of football throughout the tournament\n\nIt was a bright start with both teams looking to get onto the front foot The Burkinabe had a glorious chance to open the scoring but Prejuce Nakoulma scuffed his effort high and wide They continued to grow in confidence and Bertrand Traore almost grabbed the opener But the Chelsea Academy graduate\u2019s shot could only skim the top of the crossbar As the half time whistle approached it was the Lions of Carthage who took aim for the elusive goal but the ball went agonisingly wide off the far post Neither team could break the deadlock in what was a tightly contested opening half The second half was a more open encounter The Stallions looked the livelier of the two sides and threatened the Tunisian defence but they lacked the decisive final ball It was substitute Aristide Bance\u2019s free kick 10 minutes before the end of the match which saw the deadlock broken The former Chippa United player had only been on the pitch for four minutes before sending the ball whistling into the bottom corner of the Tunisian net Bance was an inspired substitution by Burkinabe coach Paulo Duarte as minutes later he was denied a second goal by the post\n\nThe Tunisians knew they had to throw caution to the wind as they went in search of the equaliser However it was a blistering Burkina Faso counter attack in the 83rd minute that saw the North Africans crash out Nakoulma calmly slotted the ball into an open net after beating Tunisian goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi who had found himself in no man\u2019s land With the final whistle blown the West Africans booked their place in the semi-final\n\nThe second game of the night was a mammoth encounter when Cameroon took on tournament favourites Senegal The crowd at the Stade de Franceville were in for a tantalising affair as the two Lions of African football fought valiantly The opening stanza was a tightly fought physical contest The Senegalese looked the more confident of the two teams as Cameroon were content to play on the counter attack Chances were few and far between and with the half finely balanced and neither team able to grab the game by the scruff of the neck\n\nThe second half was a more open affair but Senegal continued to dominate The Indomitable Lions defence stood resolute throughout the half Cameroonian keeper Fabrice Ondoa denied Stoke City forward Mame Biram Diouf from point blank range The four time Afcon champions showed they weren\u2019t out of the contest when Benjamin Moukandjo found himself in space but Diallo in the Senegalese goal was equal to the task\n\nREVEALED The Nations Cup Passmasters\n\nAs the final whistle approached the Teranga Lions displayed a look of disbelief as the plucky Cameroonians survived the onslaught of Senegalese pressure Extra time would be needed as the two African giants could not be separated after 90 minutes\n\nBoth teams began to show signs of fatigue in the first half of extra time as another fifteen minutes of immense defending saw the Indomitable Lions remain in the game On the stroke of half time Cameroonian Jacques Zoua found himself in space but his shot was superbly saved by impervious Diallo\n\nThe second half was nail-biting but neither team could grab the elusive goal as the game was destined to be decided by a penalty shootout The dreaded Penalty shootout saw Sadio Mane\u2019s penalty saved by the superb 21 year-old Fabrice Ondoa Cameroons Vincent Abubakar scored the winning penalty as Cameroon

That's what I missed most in my time with Paris. In 2003, we made it to the Coupe de France final, but unfortunately, we lost to Auxerre. It's always tough to deal with that kind of defeat after having such a good run. \n \n\"Paris is a special club for me, as it was here that I launched my European career. I have a lot of respect and love for this club. Of course, it's special for me to come back to where it all began for me! The fans gave me a lot of affection and respect.

The Egyptians defeated Ethiopia, 4-0, in that year's final, with Ad-Diba scoring all four goals. Sixty years later, 16 teams were selected to participate for the continent's highest honor. After play finished on Jan. 25, the field has been trimmed to eight, with the knockout stage set to begin on Saturday. \n \nAs fans anticipate the start of these win-or-go-home matches, PointAfter , a sports data site powered by Graphiq , used data from Bing Predicts to analyze every remaining match and predict each winner. Bing Predicts uses web activity and social sentiment \u2014 in addition to historical player, team and match stats \u2014 to predict the outcome of soccer matches. Web and social data allow Bing Predicts to capture real-time information about lineup changes and reaction to them to tune the strengths of teams . \n \nEgypt, who has won more titles (seven) than any other nation, again appears to be the team to beat, though the path to glory won't be easy.

She has had a profound impact on her contemporaries and her award-winning work has been the subject of several retrospectives at major art museums. Additionally, she is professor emerita at MIT (Massachussets Institute of Technology). Joan Jonas represented the US at the Venice Biennale in 2015. \n \nJoan Jonas came to Iceland in the 1980s. Her impressions of the visit inspired  Volcano Saga, 1985 \u2014a video made with actress Tilda Swinton in the role of Gudrun Osvifursdottir. This close reference to  Laxdaela Saga  was a prelude to further works by Jonas based on Icelandic literature, both ancient and recent.  Reanimation  is rooted in her interpretation of Halldor Laxness' novel  Under the Glacier . \n \nJoan Jonas is among the first artists to use the video camera in her works. She discovered the new device on a journey to Japan in 1970 when the Portapak was in its prime. Prior to this, Jonas' worked in sculpture, took workshops in dance (with such choreographers as Trisha Brown and Yvonne Rainer) and created performances, which she staged with various kind of mirrors, used to divert and splinter the spectator\u2018s sense of perception. Despite the diversity of her work and variety of mediums, Jonas\u2018 core remains consistent. During a performance, the audience watches Jonas continuously activate the stage. She interacts with figures in her video projections or intermixes the projections with live drawings made on an overhead projector. She creates noise with bells, rustling paper or percussive instruments. The spectator stays busy, following the scenes as they intuitively flow into each other. \n \nReanimation Detail, 2010 / 2012 , as in many other of Jonas\u2018 works, takes its cue from a mixture of literary sources and folk myths. Using direct passages and inspiration from Laxness\u2018  Under the Glacier , Jonas assumes the role of the rhapsode, who shows us that the resurrection, apparition and wraith are not as unnatural as we might expect but rather the reflection of the cycle of life. That Laxness should put focus on the extraordinary rising of bread in  Eyrbyggja Saga  is in Jonas\u2018 view a sign of the author\u2018s keen awareness of nature. She emphasizes his level of understanding by referring to the chapter on the bee and the dandelion, in which the dandelion scent attracts the insect and turns it into a carrier of spores, taking them beyond the horizon. \n \nJoan Jonas´s works  Reanimation Detail, 2010 / 2012  and  Volcano Saga, 1985  are now shown for the first time in Iceland, at the National Gallery of Iceland and the Akureyri Art Museum and are a collaboration of the two art museums. \n \nT  E  X   T\u2014Selected text-based works from the collection of Petur Arason and Ragna Robertsdottir \nThe exhibition T E X T shows a selection of text-based art works by 50 Icelandic and international visual artists. The works all belong to the private art collection of Reykjavík and Berlin based collectors Petur Arason and Ragna Robertsdottir, whose collection of contemporary art has reached over 1,000 works since the early 1960s until today. \n \nOn display here are works by many of the most important contemporary artists, most of which are friends and colleagues of Arason and Robertsdottir. Many of these connections have become ground for further encounters of Icelandic artists with their international colleagues and have played a major role in the dynamic art scene of Iceland. \n \nBusinessman Petur Arason and artist Ragna Robertsdottir operated the exhibition space  Second Floor , together with artist Ingolfur Arnarsson, at their home in Reykjavik in 1992\u201397. There they invited many important international contemporary artists to show their art and then acquired many of their works. These acquisitions created the basis for their art collection. \n \nArason and Robertsdottir continued to collect contemporary art and in 2003 they opened  SAFN: Contemporary Art Collection  on three floors in the same building, which they operated in collaboration with the City of Reykjavik.  SAFN  was open to the public until 2008. There the couple presented a large part of their collection, as well as around fifty temporary exhibitions of Icelandic and international artists. In 2014 they opened two exhibition spaces titled  SAFN ; at Bergstadastraeti 52 in Reykjavík and Lewetzowstrasse 16 in Berlin, offering their guests in both locations to experience selected works from their collection. \n \n\nArtists: \nBirgir Andresson, Robert Barry, Joseph Beuys, Thomas A.

Throughout the exhibition are profound meditations on exile, displacement, loss, and desire as artists connect their personal narratives with larger cultural histories; test and reinterpret technology; unearth and retell forgotten stories; and celebrate and reconstruct intimacy and identity. Curated by assistant curator of painting and sculpture Jenny Gheith, the presentation features work by 40 artists including Tauba Auerbach, Lutz Bacher, Tacita Dean, Trisha Donnelly, Emily Jacir, Sam Lewitt, Mark Manders, Paulina Olowska, Catherine Opie, Walid Raad, Doris Salcedo, Tino Sehgal and Danh Vo.  \n \nThe title phrase of the exhibition is from the seminal 1962 book The Shape of Time , in which art historian George Kubler proposes a history of cultural artifacts that traces connected ideas, sometimes over centuries, with intervening deviations and lapses. Through ideas, artworks in the exhibition embody time, capturing the moment in which they were made while connecting to pasts and futures that were equally part of their making. \n \nCurated by media arts curator Rudolf Frieling and making its West Coast debut at SFMOMA, artist William Kentridge\u2019s The Refusal of Time (2012) is an immersive installation combining synchronized video projections featuring live action, animation and dance, with audio feeds that incorporate music and sound and a central kinetic sculpture called \u201cthe elephant.\u201d Jointly owned by SFMOMA and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the work evokes an embodied history of time while simultaneously expanding our ideas about how we mark its passage.  \n \nThe Refusal of Time was originally commissioned for dOCUMENTA 13 in Kassel, Germany, and continues where Five Themes, SFMOMA\u2019s major survey of Kentridge, left off in 2009. Growing out of conversations between the artist and Harvard University physicist Peter Galison and collaborations with composer Philip Miller and video editor Catherine Meyburgh, it encompasses the artist\u2019s diverse range of artistic practices and visual motifs including drawing, film, sculpture and performance. In the installation, viewers will find energetic combinations of allusions\u2014to Greenwich Mean Time, Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, the burgeoning Industrial Age of the late 19th century and South African theater\u2014illuminating a world that is constantly revolving and breaking apart, and always profoundly alive. \n \nCurated by assistant media arts curator Tanya Zimbardo, Runa Islam: Verso is a solo presentation of the Bangladesh-born British artist Runa Islam that features the U.S. premiere of Cabinet of Prototypes (2009\u201310). A 16mm film installation from SFMOMA\u2019s collection, Cabinet of Prototypes serves as the exhibition\u2019s point of departure for exploring the threshold between film and sculpture.  \n \nAt SFMOMA, Cabinet of Prototypes is brought for the first time into conversation with a second film,  Magical Consciousness (2010), both of which stemmed from Islam\u2019s Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship and her time with the collections at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C. Cabinet of Prototypes studies the sculptural qualities of custom-designed armatures used to support and present artifacts. Through anamorphic black-and-white 16mm film, Magical Consciousness (2010) transforms the gilded back of a six-panel 16th-century Japanese folding screen into a meditation on the \"silver screen\" of cinema. \n \nA third gallery of new and recent works includes several objects incorporating Islam\u2019s ongoing process of reclaiming the silver from exposed celluloid including the drawing series \u2026 laws of night and honey\u2026\u2026 (2016).  Anatomical Studies (2013\u201314) casts select items from the artist\u2019s studio in the \"latent\" silver. Based on two surviving stills from her missing 16mm film The First Glance (2000), the works After the First Glance (2016) gesture to the re-embodiment of the subject of that film through different media.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"A Slow Succession with Many InterruptionsWilliam Kentridge: The Refusal of TimeRuna Islam: Verso","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"E-flux","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570078416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"E-flux","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.e-flux.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://sfmoma.org/"],"sequenceId":"695202458000","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There is a copy of A Woman\u2019s Work in front of us. A hardback whopper of nearly 400 pages with all kinds of enticing entries in the index: Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, 18; Association of Metropolitan Authorities, 106; Mothers in Manufacturing Report, 219, 235. One thing I learn about Harriet Harman: she\u2019s not one to shy away from the boring detail. During her time on the frontbench, she says, people would sit in cabinet meetings and literally be writing their diaries in front of her. \u201cAnd I used to think, \u2018We\u2019ve got a country to run!\u2019 I was very moral high ground about it, all the time denouncing them as male vanity projects.\u201d So, this is what? A female vanity project? \u201cYes!\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a self-consciously female vanity project. When all my colleagues\u2019 autobiographies came out, the first thing you do is to look at the photos and it would all be men. Maybe there\u2019d be their wife and someone who worked for them. And possibly Hillary Clinton and that\u2019s it. And it\u2019s like, where were the 100 women who swept into parliament? Where was the transformation reflected in our politics and the change in women\u2019s lives? You remember Sheila Rowbotham\u2019s Hidden from History? Her thing about unless it\u2019s written about, it\u2019s invisible and then it hasn\u2019t happened? \u201cWell, funnily enough, even though I was in the cabinet at the time, I don\u2019t seem to be in these memoirs either. You might find one reference, \u2018Harman, sacking of\u2019. And I thought, \u2018Well, stuff that\u2019. So I found it very easy to do my U-turn.\u201d Oh, it\u2019s raining men in the Labour party From someone else, this would be hypocritical self-aggrandisement. But this is Harriet Harman, AKA Harriet Harperson. Her conversation is littered with references to \u201cthe cause\u201d, \u201cthe struggle\u201d, \u201cthe mission\u201d \u2013 her whole adult life, and her entire career at Westminster, has been in single-minded pursuit of equal rights. And it\u2019s fair to say that A Woman\u2019s Work is in some ways more about the changing political representation of women than it is about her. It\u2019s just that she defines and embodies that change. We\u2019re in the kitchen of her house in her south London constituency, a warm, comfortable, family home with various piles of clutter and a prowling cat, the kind of fantasy dwelling that would make a millennial\u2019s heart bleed, and she\u2019s telling me how they bought it in 1987 when the area \u201cwas all social workers and FE lecturers\u201d. And now? \u201cNow it\u2019s bankers and corporate lawyers.\u201d When Harman first became an MP, at a byelection in 1982, London was a Tory stronghold, a family home was an achievable goal and she was one of only 11 women Labour MPs. And the only one who was pregnant. She was a completely new sight in British politics: a young, pregnant, feminist MP. The photos in the book show her campaigning with a babe in arms and then a toddler and they culminate in the still-record-breaking sight of the 101 Labour women elected during the 1997 landslide: Blair\u2019s Babes. Though she\u2019s still cross about that. The photo. Tutting when I bring it up. Because there they all are, \u201cFolletted\u201d up in jackets all the colours of the rainbow, the prescribed style decreed by the Labour party\u2019s fashion arbiter, the then member for Stevenage, Barbara Follett, massed around a grinning Tony Blair. \u201cIt was supposed to be the sisterhood!\u201d says Harman. \u201cIt was supposed to be us, the women, doing it for ourselves. Not as the backing group for the great leader.\u201d Even more galling was the fact that it had been her idea. She\u2019d arranged it all, when suddenly at the last minute someone added Blair to the line-up. \u201cIt was a complete failure to understand that this was a moment for women.\u201d On the other hand, she says, at least people remember it. Though she backtracks almost immediately. \u201cThough I think they would anyway.\u201d And a lot of it, of them, was down to her.

Pat Stefano, R-Bullskin Township, a co-sponsor of the medical marijuana bill. \u201cThere are a number of benefits that come from giving doctors the ability to recommend this treatment. I\u2019m happy that we were able to get the government out of the way of life-altering treatment.\u201d\n\nStefano, whose district covers all of Fayette County and portions of the Mon Valley in Westmoreland County, said his inspiration for the bill was Sydney Michaels, now 7, who suffers from a rare type of intractable epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome that caused hundreds of seizures a day. Her mother said use of a cannabis oil had reduced that number to a handful each day.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t state enough how much their frequent visits to Harrisburg helped moved the needle in the Senate and House,\u201d Stefano said of the Connellsville family.\n\nUnder the bill signed last April by Gov. Tom Wolf, cannabis can be processed into pills, oils, topical forms such as gels, creams or ointments, forms that could be administered with an inhaler or nebulizer, tinctures or liquids. Smoking is not on that list.\n\nPermit applications went online for review last week on the department\u2019s Medical Marijuana Program website. They will be accepted from Feb. 20 to March 20.\n\nBased on surveys and on expressions of interest, Department of Health (DOH) spokeswoman April Hutcheson said her agency is anticipating as many as 900 applications.\n\nThe DOH could issue 25 permits for grower/processor operations and 50 for dispensaries. However, the hurdles for would-be permit holders include one that limits primary dispensing operations to five counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nThe state plans to issue 12 permits for grower/processors, two in each of six regions including the 11 southwestern counties around Pittsburgh, and 27 permits for dispensaries, including five in the southwestern counties.\n\nThere is no limitation as to where a grower/processor can locate within a given region, but primary permits for dispensaries will be limited to two for Allegheny County and one each to Butler, Washington and Westmoreland counties.\n\nHutcheson said those getting a dispensary permit may be able to have operations in three different counties.\n\nTom Seaman hopes to secure a permit in Upper Tyrone Township, where he\u2019d convert a warehouse business to operate the medical cannabis business.\n\nSeaman recently told Scottdale council he had support from Stefano, who was cautious in responding to a question about limits in the permit process.\n\n\u201cIt is my understanding that the department will be doing the full allotment of permits in phases and this is step one of that process,\u201d Stefano said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on anything beyond that as I don\u2019t know what future plans the department has for the permits.\u201d\n\nThere are at least two would-be permit seekers in Westmoreland County, for entities in Monessen and Rostraver Township.\n\nIn Monessen, Shah Dawud El-Bey and his wife Zenobia Nabilia El-Bey are among those planning to seek permits, in their case as both a grower and a dispensary.\n\n\u201cOur aspiration for the grow-op are more about being a wholesale distributor within the state,\u201d Zenobia El-Bey said. \u201cThe reality is that dispensaries are going to run out of product, so we intend for that to be our niche. Realistically, until the country goes nationally, the interstate crossing legalities are tricky. So we are hoping to fill that gap for the state.\u201d\n\nIn Rostraver Township, Maitri Medicinals is seeking permits for both growing and dispensing medical marijuana from a warehouse there. Maitri spokesman Dick Roberts said the company would discuss the specifics of their services if they are granted a permit later this year.\n\nThose seeking both grower/processor and dispensary permits likely won\u2019t get both. State health officials said no more than five grower/processors also may be issued a dispensary permit.\n\nStefano has met with a number of interested parties, including those who have made public their intentions, but he doesn\u2019t know about the interest of others who also are considering applying.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to disclose anything that may not be ready for announcing,\u201d Stefano said. \u201cMy role has been explanatory and I try to support anyone who wants to bring development and jobs to our area. The (DOH) has set up an objective scoring metric to score the applications and I\u2019m hopeful that applicants in our area fare well as their proposals are vetted.\u201d\n\nZenobia El-Bey is CEO of Natanni Inc., a for-profit venture and one of two entities Shah Dawud and Zenobia El-Bey have in Monessen.\n\n\u201cNatanni Inc has had a key focus in the field on business consultant services, and international trade until now,\u201d Zenobia El-Bey said. \u201cWe are intending to rename the corporation Alternative Organic Solutions Inc. and our key focus will now become organic vegetation and medical marijuana.\u201d\n\nThe other is The Right Way To Go Inc., under whose banner the couple has gone before city council.\n\n\u201cWe intend to utilize some of the riverfront warehouse property in Monessen,\u201d El-Bey said after the couple\u2019s appearance at the Jan. 16 council workshop. \u201cWe have private equity capital and will be making moves to solidify ourselves before the end of January.\u201d\n\nEl-Bey said the couple will be meeting soon with a key investor.\n\n\u201cThey have agreed to a private equity position, joint venture agreement,\u201d El-Bey said.\n\n\u201cThey will be expecting a return on their investment. They will not participate in the day to day operation of the business.\u201d\n\nAnother move made by the El-Beys was to choose registered nurse Christy Allums as medical director for the proposed Monessen operation.\n\nMaitri vaulted its first hurdle Jan. 11 when the Rostraver Township zoning hearing board unanimously approved a special exception for its proposed medical marijuana production and processing facility at 316 Finley Road, in a 37,000-square-foot building owned by Vesely Brothers Properties and zoned for light manufacturing.\n\nMaitri CEO Corinne Ogrodnik told the board that 3,000-5,000 medical cannabis plants would be grown inside the building and processing equipment would extract cannabis oil from the plants. The oil in turn would be placed in capsules and lotions and distributed to dispensaries, where patients with medical marijuana prescriptions could buy it.\n\nShe told the board that up to 50 people eventually would be employed, all screened by background checks required under state law.\n\nState law allows cannabis to be prescribed for 17 medical conditions including epilepsy, autism and chronic pain.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Pat Cloonan pcloonan@heraldstandard.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Illegal drugs news","group":"Society"}],"title":"At least three local groups vie for limited number of medical marijuana permits","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Greene","zipCode":"15370","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Waynesburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald-Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"454406269","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"Herald-Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldstandard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202463661","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/25/d25e8b4b-1970-5ff7-b479-12088390dad0/588c9a1c75135.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/25/d25e8b4b-1970-5ff7-b479-12088390dad0/588c9a1c75135.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 49 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Greenville","zipCode":"29609","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WYFF4.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659149","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"107"},"name":"WYFF4.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","HealthCare"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wyff4.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202463969","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It puts us back in the heart of the Connellsville community.\u2019\u2019\n\nPalm noted, \u201cWe\u2019ve always covered the city of Connellsville, and, in recent years, have even enhanced our news coverage. I\u2019m hoping by opening a Herald-Standard office in the city, this will prove our commitment to the Connellsville community and entice residents to share more of their news with us.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Herald-Standard publishes six days a week and offers the only Sunday newspaper in the community.\n\nLike the Uniontown office, the Connellsville bureau will be open 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday and staffed with editorial and sales personnel, bringing an array of services to the community. The office phone number is 724-603-2008.\n\n\u201cWe will have papers for sale there. Subscribers can pay their bills and set up subscriptions,\u2019\u2019 Pinarski said. \u201cThe public can drop by to discuss news item and advertising needs.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn addition, the Herald-Standard will offer services that include the Be Local Network, which is a marketing plan dedicated to strengthening the region\u2019s economy and promoting local independent businesses, as well as OnPoint Media Solutions, designed to help small businesses thrive in the digital age.\n\nTed Flowers, Be Local coordinator and Herald-Standard multimedia consultant, said, \u201cWe want to educate residents and visitors about the importance of thinking, buying, investing and visiting locally owned and independent business to strengthen the local economy. We want them to use our motto, which is \u2018Think, Buy, Invest and Visit.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nOnPoint offers advertising and digital services like website design, social media management, texting, blogging and more to help increase revenue for businesses and organizations.\n\nPinarski pointed out the Herald-Standard\u2019s new bureau is part of a growing redevelopment in Connellsville.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years, a number of businesses have opened in Connellsville. Connellsville has a vibrant and energized chamber of commerce,\u2019\u2019 Pinarski said. \u201cGreg Lincoln, the mayor, is working hard in the community, and we want to be part of that as well as help bring jobs to the Connellsville community.\u2019\u2019\n\nCommunity leaders are welcoming.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to have the Herald-Standard back in the city again,\u2019\u2019 said Lincoln. \u201cI\u2019m taking it as a positive of the hard work we\u2019ve been doing in the city to make it more marketable. There are more things to cover in the city. 2017 is going to be a very positive year for Connellsville.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad they\u2019re back,\u201d said Michael Edwards, executive director for the , who noted, \u201cThe whole Be Local program is something that\u2019s important to us. Most of our businesses are private and independently owned.\u201d\n\nBrooke Deason, executive director of the Greater Connellsville Chamber of Commerce, said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to more of a storefront presence from the Herald-Standard, having them here, being able to interact, share stories and be part of Be Local. We already promote Be Local. Our businesses are looking forward to being more involved.\u2019\u2019\n\nDeason added, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a long relationship with the Herald-Standard, but having them up the street is convenient.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Herald-Standard\u2019s new bureau is one of many businesses locating to downtown Connellsville in recent years.\n\nThe new Cobblestone Hotel and Suites is slated to open on North First Street near the Great Allegheny Passage biking and hiking trail that runs from Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C.\n\nEdwards noted, \u201cA lot of businesses have been built around the Great Allegheny Passage. It was completed a couple of years ago and now we\u2019re seeing spin-off businesses.\u2019\u2019\n\nEdwards said they include restaurants, and noted state Sen. Pat Stefano, R-Bullskin Township, established an office in Downtown Connellsville. The Connellsville Canteen contains a local World War II history museum as well as the Indian Creek Valley Railroad Display in addition to a café.\n\nSkip and Pat Colborn, of Colborn and Harrison Properties, own the building in which the Herald-Standard\u2019s new bureau is located.\n\nThe couple had been living in Florida, then going back and forth before returning three years ago to Mill Run where Skip Colborn grew up, graduating from Connellsville Area High School in 1969. He is a licensed landscape architect and maintains businesses in Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Colborns purchased their Connellsville building in December 2014. It housed a number of businesses over the years, most recently Salvatore\u2019s Sewing Center.\n\nSkip Colborn, who attended business workshops in Connellsville when he started coming back to the area, said, \u201cDowntown Connellsville seemed to show excitement in its revitalization. My wife and I were looking for a long-term investment in Connellsville, and this building would not only help us but could do something for downtown Connellsville.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe couple has made renovations to some of the upstairs apartments and are happy to welcome the Herald-Standard as street-front clients.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for a client who would contribute to the current upswing of downtown Connellsville and be involved in the community,\u2019\u2019 Skip Colborn said, noting, \u201cWe are excited that the Herald-Standard is coming in.\u2019\u2019","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Frances Borsodi Zajac fzajac@heraldstandard.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Herald-Standard opens new office in Connellsville","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Greene","zipCode":"15370","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Waynesburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald-Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"454406269","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"Herald-Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldstandard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202464177","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/9a/a9a22037-28a7-52f9-bbc2-61855c9df898/588bfec1c86cd.image.jpg?resize=944%2C630"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/9a/a9a22037-28a7-52f9-bbc2-61855c9df898/588bfec1c86cd.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The Food Fundi Coffee Cafe is a great place to make a stop.   Where gourmet food on the go is prepared    \nFrom humble beginnings, the eatery has grown to be listed as one the top 500 restaurants in South Africa. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day girl,\u201d says Melanie Reeder-Powell as she welcomes me. \u201cYou know, we received the news that we are recognised as one of the best restaurants on Eat Out. I wasn\u2019t even aware when the food critique was here but boom, that\u2019s how it was.\u201d \n \nQualified chef, Jason Powell and his wife, can attest to people\u2019s perception of the cafe specifically catering for health gurus, as this is not the case. Melanie tells us more: \n \nWhat is The Food Fundi all about? \nFunny enough, most people who are not familiar with the place often think our food is for diabetics. However, it is home-made, wholesome and we offer health options as well. Our food is freshly made and our products are not injected with brine. The menu is quite extensive and it changes seasonally. In short, we offer gourmet food on the go. \n  \nChef and owner, Jason Powell. \nPhoto: Frans Louw \n  \nTake us through your journey \nWe have come a long way! It all started at Absa Square, with a very tiny set-up and six years later, we\u2019ve grown and moved to a friendlier environment allowing us to accommodate more people. My husband has travelled and cooked in most parts of the world for famous people including Nelson Mandela and his wife, Graca, while they were in Mozambique with limited resources. There is also a Food Fundi Express at the Lowveld Hospital that offers a limited menu for patients, visitors and locals. \n \nWho is your clientele? \nIt ranges from a mix of groups. Mothers, the young and upcoming, couples and gym fanatics who usually come from across the street after a workout. The set-up at this centre is child-friendly as well. It is your one-stop shop. \n \nWhat distinguishes you from the rest? \nWe offer something different and I believe our clients are able to taste the difference in our food. Our bread is home baked by our pastry chef, Antoneitte. We source our products from local suppliers and our packaging is recyclable. We are the only restaurant in Mpumalanga that serves wine and craft beer on tap, and we also offer a selective wine list that is affordable. \n  \nA venison burger with chilli beetroot relish and halloumi cheese, and sweet potato chips.

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left.

We have a semi-final to play, and whoever it is against we hope it will be as beautiful as this.\" \n\nSenegal had enjoyed the better of the chances in normal time, but could not find a way past Ondoa, who was in inspired form. \n\n\"Our performance was good. We tried to play football against a side who were well organised and got men behind the ball,\" said the Senegal coach Aliou Cisse, who had missed the crucial penalty when the Lions of Teranga lost the 2002 final. \n\n\"We know about penalties. It comes down to luck. They won it and I wish them good luck.\" \n\nSenegal's elimination means the three men who made up the podium for the 2016 African Footballer of the Year award have all been knocked out of the Cup of Nations, with Mane joining Algeria's Riyad Mahrez and Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in heading for the exit. \n\nNobody had expected to see Cameroon go far after their build-up to the tournament had been marred by the refusal of several key players to accept call-ups. \n\nFew tipped Burkina Faso to go far either, but the 2013 runners-up secured their place in the last four by getting the better of Tunisia with two late goals. \n\nThe Stallions had looked the more dangerous side throughout but it took the late introduction of Aristide Bance to make the difference. \n\nPortuguese coach Paulo Duarte introduced the giant striker on 76 minutes as a tight, physical last-eight clash seemed destined for extra time. \n\nWithin five minutes Bance broke the deadlock in front of a sparse crowd in Libreville by slamming the ball into the net after a free-kick was pushed into his path just outside the box. \n\nPrejuce Nakoulma doubled the lead on 84 minutes through a breakaway goal and Burkina Faso will now meet Egypt or Morocco at the same venue on Wednesday. \n\n\"We produced high-level football,\" said Duarte. \"There was quality and confidence in our performance. \n\n\"The dream is to do better than in 2013, but it will not be easy.\" \n\nTunisia coach Henryk Kasperczak said: \"We did not show our qualities. We did not possess the rage to win. \n\n\"We were a little tired, the physical freshness was not perfect, we did not play quickly enough when attacking.\" \n\nDR Congo and 2015 runners-up Ghana meet in Oyem on Sunday at 1600 GMT. \n\nThe last quarter-final, between Herve Renard's Morocco and their north African rivals Egypt, is in Port-Gentil at 1900 GMT. - Nampa-AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Cameroon news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Burkina Faso news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Gabon news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Senegal news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Agony for Mane as Cameroon, Burkina Faso reach Cup semis","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"NA","country":"Namibia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Namibian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169784862","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"152"},"name":"Namibian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.namibian.com.na"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202472644","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.
