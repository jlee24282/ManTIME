From left are Lt. John Kennedy, Major John Lewis, Lt. Col. Tony Grant, and Lt. Col. Tony Brown. \n \nAcross the state of Georgia, all , which is good for them but creates a headache for some of their colleagues. \n\n \nThe boost in pay proposed by Governor Nathan Deal last year will provide raises for 3,300 state troopers, Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents, prison guards, parole officers and natural-resources rangers. \n \nThe raises, the governor said, were the result of watching some of the state\u2019s best-trained officers leave for higher pay at other agencies or for local police departments. \n \nHowever, many of Georgia\u2019s sheriffs claim they are witnessing the same talent migration on the local level. \n \nCoweta County Sheriff Mike Yeager says he has seen several deputies leave for jobs at the state and federal level after the county has spent a considerable sum to train and certify them to serve and protect locally. \n \nThe sheriff\u2019s office currently has eight people in the police academy in Columbus - the largest number it has had in the academy at once, Yeager believes. The patrol division has also been testing a number of applicants who are already state certified, many who are also leaving smaller agencies that can\u2019t match what Coweta is offering. \n \n\"I talk to sheriffs in smaller counties whose jail officers make $9 an hour and deputies make $10.50. Frankly, I don\u2019t see how they\u2019re making it,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cSure, public service work may not pay the best, but these people have passion for it, and we need to find ways to ensure better pay so we don\u2019t lose them.\u201d \n \nFinding A Way \n \nIn 2016, Coweta County undertook a nine-month compensation study to evaluate positions and salaries of employees. It was the first compensation study done since the 1990s, according to Patricia Palmer, Coweta\u2019s community and human relations director. \n \nIn the end, consultants determined that 2 percent of current county employees were getting paid more than comparable employees in similar counties. Fifteen percent were getting paid less than they should, and the other 83 percent were within the salary range that the consulting company recommended. \n \nAccording to Palmer, 911 communicators, corrections officers and deputies were a primary focus. \n \n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that our salaries would benchmark against other communities,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cWe wanted to compare competitively and remain competitive in order to maintain and recruit quality employees.\u201d \n \nPrior to the study, the starting salary for a state certified deputy was $32,961. Now, the starting salary is $40,199 \u2013 a 22 percent increase. Detention officers went from $29,000 to $35,700 annually, and the raises brought the average pay in the sheriff\u2019s office to just under $36,000. \n \nCounty Administrator Michael Fouts said the study stressed the need to retain and recruit quality employees. \n \n\u201cWe haven\u2019t undertaken a task like this since the early 1990s, and there have been significant changes in the scope of the role law enforcement since then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to take that into consideration along with the nature of public safety and what it has evolved into.\u201d \n \nIn the city of Newnan, police have seen incremental raises in pay since 2012, according to City Manager Cleatus Phillips. Using the same compensation study team, the city discovered its pay of police is in range with other areas the same size as Newnan. \n \nComparing the city with areas like Peachtree City, LaGrange, Douglasville, Griffin, Stockbridge and McDonough, the consultants determined the average salary of a police officer was $1,133 higher in Newnan. \n \nA policeman in Newnan can start off between $34,922 and $54,143, depending on experience. \n \nAt Georgia State Patrol Post 24, Sgt. Mike Adcock is also concerned about the numbers regarding recruitment and believes the recent move by Deal will help get the ranks of his post back up to where he would like. \n \nAddressing The Need \n \nThe post is down to nine troopers despite being responsible for covering Coweta, Heard and Fayette County. It\u2019s a little less than half of the 15 troopers that Adcock believes are needed to adequately cover the region. \n \n\u201cThose counties are growing, and we certainly need more manpower,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the pay increase will help move us forward into changing that.\u201d \n \nBut while things are looking better in Coweta, the average starting salary for a deputy sheriff in Georgia is around $29,900 while detention officers start at $25,300, according to the Georgia Sheriffs\u2019 Association. With the 20 percent increase, the starting salary of a Georgia State Patrol trooper will now be 55 percent higher than a typical deputy sheriff in Georgia. \n \n\u201cThe bigger areas who have the budget and resources, they are able to address the issue of losing personnel to state and federal agencies,\u201d said Terry Norris, executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs\u2019 Association. \u201cBut for those other areas where you have the $10- and $11-an hour employees, it\u2019s a phenomenally sad occurance to see.\u201d \n \nFollowing Deal\u2019s announcement last year, the Georgia Sheriffs\u2019 Association adopted a \"local law enforcement compensation reform\u201d effort to continue the conversation about pay and resources for officers who aren\u2019t employed by the state. \n \nThe association plans to push for legislation during the current session of the General Assembly which would ensure that all local police, deputies, detention officers and sheriffs would receive minimum salaries competitive to the ones offered to state employees. \n \nA few of the strategies proposed by the association include a minimum starting salary for police, jailers and deputies, a special sales tax dedicated exclusively to funding salaries and benefits, and a state income tax credit for full-time corrections officers who earn less than $40,000. \n \nHowever, Fouts said such a broad move might not be the best plan, and each county should be allowed to tackle the issue in a way that works best for it. \n \n\u201cI would caution legislators on setting a standard across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at salary alone. You have to look at other factors such as the cost to the local government. Self-governance is a very important aspect of all of this.\u201d \n \nFirst Responders vs. Support Agencies \n \nWhile Norris said he appreciated Deal\u2019s efforts, it directly benefits a relatively small portion of the law enforcement community. \n \n\u201cThe state law enforcement agencies that (Peace Officers Standards and Training Council) recognizes such as GBI, State Patrol and Department of Natural Resources, is comprised of around 1,600 people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you talk about how many make up local police, county deputies and sheriffs, it\u2019s a combined 28,000.\u201d \n \nIn 2016, state law enforcement agents made a little over 21,000 arrests, according to the Georgia Crime Information Center, while police and deputies made 408,000 arrests. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that local law enforcement are always the first on the scene and are the first responders of law enforcement,\u201d Norris said. \u201cWhile we appreciate everything that state law enforcement does, they are support agencies. They don\u2019t answer 911 calls. They support local enforcement once something is discovered.\u201d \n \nAnd while pay is certainly an issue for anyone considering a career in law enforcement, the current political climate isn\u2019t making things any easier, according to Yeager, who chairs the state council. \n \nIn 2016, Georgia experienced approximately eight line-of-duty deaths for peace officers \u2013 placing it 4th in the nation just behind Texas, Louisiana and California. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. We\u2019re very grateful for the raise that Deal gave to troopers and for the recent raise we saw in Coweta,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cBut across the state, many counties and cities aren\u2019t as fortunate as we are, and the discussion needs to be started.\u201d \n \n**** \n \nClay Neely: clay@newnan.com, @clayneely","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Sheriffs\u2019 Association seeks discussion on the pay gap between state and local law enforcement","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Coweta","zipCode":"30263","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newnan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Times-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"192729622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"349"},"name":"The Times-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.times-herald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199681344","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Five fire engines and four support vehicles ultimately responded to the blaze, which was brought under control shortly after the first units arrived, Strangio said. \n \nThe occupants of the house were away traveling and returned later that day, Strangio said. Nobody was injured, and foul play is not suspected, he said. \n \nThe entire rear half of the building was destroyed and will need to be rebuilt, while the front half was severely damaged and will require remodeling, Strangio said. The fire department declared the house a total loss. \n \nThe outside panes of several dual-pane windows on a neighboring house were shattered by heat emanating from the fire, Strangio said. Several plastic fixtures were melted, and shrubbery growing up the wall of the house was destroyed, he said. \n \nOn the other side of the house, firefighters damaged a fence after scrambling to get into position with their hose, Strangio said. \n \nLuck played a critical role in the fire\u2019s quick suppression, Strangio said. The north and south stations were transitioning between shifts just as the neighbors\u2019 call came in, so the department had twice the manpower they usually had to respond, he said. \n \nWithout the extra personnel, the fire could have expanded and caused more damage, Strangio said. The added help allowed fire crews to subdue the blaze before it destroyed the adjacent building, he said. \n \nFire personnel were still investigating the cause of the fire on Saturday afternoon, Strangio said. It would take them about 48 hours to release their findings, he said. \n \nAdvertisement","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Erick O'Donnell Ukiah Daily Journal udjeo@ukiahdj.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Cypress Street home a total loss","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mendocino","zipCode":"95482","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ukiah","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ukiah Daily Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169722760","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"18"},"name":"Ukiah Daily Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199683398","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:21:44Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.ukiahdailyjournal.com/storyimage/NP/20170128/NEWS/170129902/AR/0/AR-170129902.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Professors are expected to demonstrate that they are active researchers and that their work has been vetted by peers and disseminated in reputable scholarly forums. \n\nThat increase in expectations has led to an increase in the competition to publish in a finite number of available forums. While research quality is the single most important factor in determining whether your article will be published, a number of procedural mistakes can help tip the balance against you. \n\nAs editor of one of my discipline's major scholarly journals, I have served on a number of conference panels with other editors to talk about publishing. Our concerns about submissions are surprisingly consistent across a range of disciplines. Knowing what those concerns are and paying attention to a few helpful tips might significantly improve your chance of placing your next scholarly article. \n\nThe No. 1 complaint of editors: We often receive submissions that reveal the author is unfamiliar with the journal and perhaps has never even read it. \n\nThat unfamiliarity becomes manifest in a variety of ways. Some authors will submit a type of article that is clearly inappropriate, such as when a theory journal receives an empirical research report or when a pedagogical journal receives a lengthy philosophical treatise. Other authors will submit informal, chatty pieces to a journal that publishes only formal scholarly works, or vice versa. Still others will submit work formatted according to MLA style (Modern Language Association) when the journal requires APA (American Psychological Association). \n\nSubmitting an article that is clearly inappropriate for the journal will result in a swift rejection, and may well cause the editor to be wary of your future submissions. \n\nFrequent complaint No. 2: Academics sometimes submit work riddled with grammatical and proofreading errors. A poorly proofread manuscript can cause editors and reviewers to question how careful you have been in conducting your research; if your writing is sloppy, perhaps your scholarship is as well. A meticulously polished manuscript leaves us confident in you and your work. \n\nBy polished, I mean avoiding awkward sentences, unclear modifiers, ungrammatical constructions, improper word usage, misuse of punctuation \u2014 i.e., the same things you expect your students to avoid. \n\nPoorly edited and proofread manuscripts can cause editors a great deal of frustration, and occasionally amusement. In one manuscript I read, the author wrote, \"A major postmodern philosopher, I believe Derrida's work will assert influence for decades.\" That author was not a major philosopher, postmodern or otherwise, and meant to write \"exert,\" not \"assert.\" Another author referred to a \"posthumously written work\" (which would be quite a feat), and a third lauded a work for \"drawing heavily on the scientific disciples\" rather than \"disciplines.\" Occasionally, a sentence is so garbled that it is impossible to decipher. Ensuring that your manuscript is well edited is fully in your control, and an ideal opportunity to create a good first impression. \n\nAnother common form of sloppiness is writers who misquote or incorrectly cite their sources. A recent study of articles in public-health journals found that nearly a third of the references contained errors; 3 percent of them were so botched they could not be tracked down. I have literally received manuscripts \u2014 some of them from senior scholars \u2014 in which every citation was incorrect (a misspelled name, an incorrect page number, an inaccurate publication date) and in which errors had been introduced into direct quotations. Double checking your quotes and references takes relatively little time and is another important way to produce a positive first impression of your work. \n\nMy own pet peeve is writers who submit manuscripts that fail to cite articles previously published in the journal on the topic. If you think of scholarly work as a kind of ongoing conversation about a series of key topics in a discipline, then it is important to acknowledge those who are already participating in the conversation. \n\nWhen you attempt to join a conversation by submitting a manuscript to a journal, but you fail to cite previously published work relevant to your own scholarship, you not only slight the journal and the other scholars, but you also might be sending a message that perhaps you haven't kept up with latest scholarship \u2014 not a good signal to send your editor. \n\nThen comes the problem of writers who ignore specific submission requirements. If a journal requires four copies of your article with return postage clipped \u2014 but not pasted \u2014 to the return envelope, it is bad form to send three copies with the return postage pasted to the envelope. \n\nSuch concerns may seem trivial, especially given that many periodicals are moving to electronic submission, but consider just how many articles we see. Consider how much competition you have. Disregarding a journal's submission requirements is yet another way to communicate either sloppiness or lack of concern. Why risk sending negative messages when positive ones are firmly in your control? \n\nSome authors make the mistake of submitting a conference paper to a journal without taking the necessary steps to convert the paper to a form appropriate for publication. Conference papers tend to be short and less formal than the type of scholarship typically published by most academic journals. While many good journal articles first began as a presentation, they usually need to be fleshed out and substantially expanded to be suitable for print. \n\nAnother common concern is how some writers deal with reader reports \u2014 the evaluations of your manuscript commissioned by journal editors and written by fellow academics in your field. \n\nIf an editor asks you to revise your article according to the reader reports, don't be defensive. Some academics mount elaborate responses, pointing out all the flaws in their critics' interpretation of the manuscript. That kind of response may be cathartic for the scholar, but it's not editorially productive. \n\nMost reader reports are prepared in good faith, and it would be a mistake to take the criticism personally. The fact that a reviewer misunderstood your work might indicate that other readers could develop similar misperceptions. Try to follow as many recommendations as you can, in good conscience. If there is a recommendation that you can't follow, explain why, carefully and succinctly, in a letter to the editor. \n\nMany academics weaken their odds of future publication by reacting badly to an editor's rejection. That's a perennial problem; the acceptance rate of any good scholarly journal is typically quite low, so the chance of rejection is always necessarily high. \n\nDon't assume that your work has been judged substandard simply because a journal decided against publication. Editors are always dealing with matters of \"fit,\" and your article might be excellent \u2014 just not a good fit for any number of reasons. \n\nAuthors who attempt to argue with editors over a rejection or to persuade them to change their minds are playing with fire. This particular article might not have been a good match for the journal, but maybe your next one will be. It would be counterproductive to risk alienating the editor. \n\nIn short: \n\nFamiliarize yourself with the types of articles that a journal publishes and only submit work appropriate for that journal. \n\nPay close attention to the tone and style of work published in the journal and try to duplicate it in your own work. \n\nFollow, religiously, the style guide used by the journal. No hybrid styles! \n\nOnly submit work that you believe to be final, publishable copy. A poorly proofread manuscript wastes your time and mine. \n\nPlacing your work in the context of articles previously published in the journal is good scholarly practice and helps make your article a better \"fit\" for the journal. \n\nFollow the journal's submission rules \u2014 exactly. \n\nDevelop a healthy attitude toward rejection. You know from the outset that competition is fierce, so maintain a positive attitude. \n\nMost of the concerns I have mentioned are unlikely to cause an editor to reject your article outright, but they could create a negative impression. And if an editor is wavering, too many missteps could turn the decision on your article from a \"revise and resubmit\" into a \"rejection.\" \n\nRemember, when you submit a manuscript to a scholarly journal, you have two audiences to satisfy: first the editor and external reviewers, and then the journal's readers. You need to satisfy that first group so you can have the opportunity to appeal to the second. \n\nLynn Worsham is a professor of English at Illinois State University and editor of JAC, a quarterly journal of rhetoric, writing, culture, and politics.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"LYNN WORSHAM"},"topics":[{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Journalism news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"What Editors Want","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Chronicle of Higher Education","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670543","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"93"},"name":"Chronicle of Higher Education","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard","Education"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199684020","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is a demanding task that can be daunting even to seasoned lawyers. \n \nFor the roughly 80 high school students who competed at Mendocino County\u2019s mock trial semi-final competition on Saturday, it was just one more extracurricular activity to juggle with school work and friends. \n \nTeams from Developing Virtue Girls School in Talmage, Fort Bragg High School, Laytonville High School, and Ukiah High School squared off in the first half of the two-day competition, where students took on the roles of defense attorneys, prosecutors, witnesses, and bailiffs in a fictional criminal trial. In a dramatic rhetorical struggle to prove the guilt or innocence of a restaurateur accused of human trafficking, competitors cross-examine witnesses, answer probing questions, make objections, and deliver closing arguments, and their performances are judged by legal professionals, who award points according to how well they employ carefully honed courtroom tactics. \n \nThe first session of the tournament will conclude with the third round, held the morning of Feb. 4, and the two teams with the most accumulated points will proceed to the fourth and final round. The winner of the competition will represent Mendocino County at the Califronia Mock Trial Finals, which will be held in late March in Riverside.   \n \nThe stakes may not be real, but the skills these young jurists develop can be uncannily close to the real thing, said Zach Snyder, an attorney who coaches the Ukiah High School team. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s also really impressive about the students, not only do they memorize what they have to, but they\u2019re able to think on their feet and they\u2019re able to respond in the moment,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cYou know, I have to remind myself sometimes that they\u2019re not real attorneys.\u201d \n \nThe constant trial and error of practice can be demanding, especially for students with already packed extracurricular schedules, students and attorneys said. But grinding competition eventually pays off, providing students the opportunity to recognize their talents and gain a clearer view of a potential career path. \n \nHannah Hinrichs, a freshman at Ukiah High School who testifies and is cross-examined as an expert witness, has long aspired to be a defense attorney. Before participating in her school\u2019s mock-trial program, though, she had been able to glean only a rough understanding of her likely future career from court dramas and online research. \n \n\u201cI always kind of wanted to be a lawyer, but this really brought me closer to knowing how it actually works,\u201d Hinrichs said. \n \nThe skills these students develop over the course of a season prepare them to be confident and articulate young women and men regardless of whether they go to law school or not, Snyder said. \n \n \n\u201cYou see some students start out, and they\u2019re shy, and they\u2019re not good public speakers,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cAnd after a couple months, you\u2019re like, \u2018This isn\u2019t the same person. The performance they\u2019re giving is great.\u2019 Which is pretty rewarding to see that happen.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Erick O'Donnell The Ukiah Daily Journal udjeo@ukiahdj.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Mock trials give students a taste of the real thing","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mendocino","zipCode":"95482","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ukiah","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ukiah Daily Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169722760","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"18"},"name":"Ukiah Daily Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199687426","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:15:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.ukiahdailyjournal.com/storyimage/NP/20170128/NEWS/170129904/AR/0/AR-170129904.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Only writers\u2019 initials are used because you can write The Watchdog in confidence. So what\u2019s on your mind? \n\nDear Watchdog: \n\nWe receive several robocalls per day. I have gone to NoMoRobo.com, but it is not compatible with AT&T, my service provider. Are there any other ways to block these annoying calls? \n\n\u2014 T.F. \n\nDear T.F.: \n\nFunny you mention this. Let me take this opportunity to share that AT&T has released a free call blocker application called A&T Call Protect. It\u2019s available to some wireless customers with iPhone or Android smartphones. The Watchdog hasn\u2019t tested it yet. I\u2019m hesitant. Why? See next letter. \n\n  \n\nDear Watchdog: \n\nAT&T\u2019s new feature is AT&T Call Protect. The attached is the Terms of Service for Call Protect. Look at paragraph 2.7. I don\u2019t see why they need my contacts on my cellphone. I value my privacy and pass on apps that collect too much of my personal data, especially without my consent. If newsworthy, I would appreciate your Watchdog Nation review of this Call Protect app and share that. \n\n\u2014 R.N. \n\nDear R.N.: \n\nI\u2019m with you. If an app requests access to my contacts, I say, \u201cNo way.\u201d You raise an important point, R.N. Definitely newsworthy. Thanks for sharing \u2014 and I followed up. \n\nI asked AT&T\u2019s Texas spokesman Dale Ingram about this invasion of privacy. His response: \u201cTo best block unwanted calls, and enable valid calls to get through and be recognized by the customer, it is important for the AT&T Call Protect app to have access to their address book. And it is important to note the address book data is used by the AT&T Call Protect app on the device only and is not further shared or collected.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll point out that everybody\u2019s favorite blocker \u2014 NoMoRobo.com \u2014 doesn\u2019t require your contacts to shut down scammers. NoMoRobo worries about the number calling you, not the numbers in your address book. Good catch, R.N. Think twice before trying Call Protect. \n\n  \n\nDear Watchdog: \n\nI am asking about ways to get off mailing lists. I have been besieged and buried this year. I think I got about 13 stopped, but I have many I need to delete forever. Is there a reliable address I can contact to get this stopped? Any help you might offer will be much appreciated. \n\n\u2014 C.G. \n\nDear C.G.: \n\nYou didn\u2019t say whether these were emails or postal mailings that annoy you so much. If it\u2019s emails, it\u2019s easiest to right click on the email and instruct that any future emails from that address or domain go directly to your spam or trash folder. \n\nIf it\u2019s postal mailings clogging your mailbox, you can do a search for \u201cDMA Choice\u201d and register with DMAchoice.org to better control your mail flow. The service, offered by the Data & Marketing Association, promises to \u201chelp you start getting the mail you want \u2014 and stop getting the mail you don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n  \n\nDear Watchdog: \n\nMy credit card was used to order auto parts on four occasions. I realize I am not responsible for the charges, but these thieves are getting away with stealing millions by spreading their purchases across all of our credit cards. Is there anything that can be done to apprehend these criminals? \n\n\u2014 B.L. \n\nDear B.L.: \n\nIf you find anyone who cares, let me know. That would be unusual and worthy of a story. Nobody cares. Everybody is a victim. It\u2019s an easy crime to get away with. \n\n  \n\nDear Watchdog: \n\nMy complaint involves a car purchase. We were promised certain features, but the vehicle didn\u2019t contain them. The sales manager dismissed that as not being important. While skeptical of any salesperson whose living depends on commissions, I never expected this level of gross deception. I never expected the parent corporation to be so callous in its corporate stance to adopt a do-nothing attitude. I need your help. \n\n\u2014 R.R. \n\nDear R.R.: \n\nMy suggestion. Write a letter to the car company\u2019s CEO. You\u2019ll have to Google name and address. Send it by certified mail. Tell the CEO you talked to me and \u201cbefore he writes anything he wanted me to give you a chance to fix this.\u201d \n\nSay, \u201cHere\u2019s something I know you\u2019d want to know about a representative of your company.\u201d Tell the CEO exactly what you want to make your situation better. Let me know what happens. \n\nSix weeks later, R.R. writes back. \n\nDear Watchdog: \n\nI want to thank you very much for your very helpful advice. I proposed paying the difference between the two models, which I think is very fair. Although the CEO\u2019s office first tried to say their hands were tied, I stressed very emphatically how this damaged the carmaker\u2019s reputation. It worked! We now have a new car with all the promised safety features. \n\nVoila. Another victory for Watchdog Nation.

In a bilateral meeting, the two leaders highlighted the close cooperation between the IOC and China with regard to the organisation of the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.\n\nPresident Xi expressed his personal commitment to make these Games a success. They also discussed how the already strong ties can be strengthened in the future and how to promote the role of sport in society. Sitting at the original desk belonging to the founder of the Olympic Movement, Pierre de Coubertin, President Xi signed the IOC\u2019s visitors\u2019 book to commemorate his historic visit to the Olympic Capital.\n\nIOC Honorary President Jacques Rogge, IOC Vice-President Yu Zaiqing, IOC Members from China Li Lingwei and Yang Yang, as well as IOC Member and ANOC President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah joined President Bach to welcome the Chinese Head of State.\n\n\u201cChina and the IOC enjoy excellent relations and strong cooperation on many different levels. The historic visit of President Xi Jinping to the IOC is another expression of this great cooperation and our friendship with the Chinese people,\u201d said President Bach. \u201cThis is an excellent foundation to write history once more, with Beijing set to become the first city in the world to host both the summer and winter editions of the Olympic Games.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, President Xi highlighted the important role of sport in China, saying that sport is an integral part of the country\u2019s national development plan: \u201cOver the years, the IOC and President Bach have made important contributions to support the healthy development not only of the Olympic Movement but also the development of sport in China. I would like to express my appreciation for what you have done.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cWe have many dreams, the Chinese dream of turning China into a society of prosperity; the dream of promoting the Olympic Movement; and also the dream of fostering a community of shared destiny for the whole of humanity. All the dreams are interconnected and integrated with one another. In this respect, I believe the IOC has a huge role to play to help the fulfilment of all these dreams.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese President was in Lausanne on January 18, following his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos and meetings with the Swiss Federal Government.

We have a semi-final to play, and whoever it is against we hope it will be as beautiful as this.\" \n\nSenegal had enjoyed the better of the chances in normal time, but could not find a way past Ondoa, who was in inspired form. \n\n\"Our performance was good. We tried to play football against a side who were well organised and got men behind the ball,\" said the Senegal coach Aliou Cisse, who had missed the crucial penalty when the Lions of Teranga lost the 2002 final. \n\n\"We know about penalties. It comes down to luck. They won it and I wish them good luck.\" \n\nSenegal\u2019s elimination means the three men who made up the podium for the 2016 African Footballer of the Year award have all been knocked out, with Mane joining Algeria\u2019s Riyad Mahrez and Gabon\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in heading for the Afcon exit. \n\nWatch highlights from the penalty shootout: \n\nNobody had expected to see Cameroon go far after their build-up to the tournament had been marred by the refusal of several key players to accept call-ups. \n\nFew tipped Burkina Faso to go far either, but the 2013 runners-up secured their place in the last four by getting the better of Tunisia with two late goals. \n\nBurkina Faso had looked the more dangerous side throughout but it took the late introduction of Aristide Bance to make the difference. \n\nPortuguese manager Paulo Duarte introduced the tall striker on 76 minutes as a tight, physical last-eight clash seemed destined for extra time. \n\nWithin five minutes, Bance broke the deadlock in front of a sparse crowd in Libreville by slamming the ball into the net after a free-kick was pushed into his path just outside the box. \n\nPrejuce Nakoulma doubled the lead on 84 minutes through a breakaway goal and Burkina Faso will now meet Egypt or Morocco at the same venue on Wednesday. \n\n\"We produced high-level football,\" Duarte said. \"There was quality and confidence in our performance. \n\n\"The dream is to do better than in 2013, but it will not be easy.\" \n\nTunisia manager Henryk Kasperczak said: \"We did not show our qualities.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country.

Mike McGuire introduced a bill this week that would prohibit marijuana businesses from using both the name of a California county or any name that appears similar to it unless their cannabis is produced in that county. \n \nReached Wednesday afternoon, McGuire (D-Healdsburg) said the bill, while only adding a few clauses to existing law, would protect counties for years to come from companies \u201cimproperly capitalizing\u201d on their name. \n \n\u201cA similar battle was fought several years ago by the wine industry and it was resolved by legislation that prevented individuals and corporations from making marketing claims that weren\u2019t true, or what we call \u2018alternative facts\u2019 these days,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cThis legislation is all about truth in labeling.\u201d \n \nUnder Proposition 64 and the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, it is illegal for marijuana products to use the name of a California county in the product\u2019s labeling, marketing or packaging if the marijuana was not grown in that county. McGuire\u2019s Senate Bill 175 expands those prohibitions to include \u201cany similar sounding name that is likely to mislead consumers as to the origin of the product.\u201d \n \nHumboldt County Chamber of Commerce Treasurer and permitting consultant Dani Burkhart stated the modifications in McGuire\u2019s bill are important to protect the cannabis cultivation \u201cprestige\u201d of the Emerald Triangle counties \u2014 Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity. \n \n\u201cNot only is this important for the farmers and the county to protect the brand, but it\u2019s incredibly important for consumer protection because they have the right to know,\u201d Burkhart said. \n \nThe bill is a direct response to North Coast cannabis farmers\u2019 concerns over businesses using brands and names that allude to the Emerald Triangle counties in order to bolster their product sales, even if the product isn\u2019t produced there. \n \nOne company, hmbldt, which produces medical cannabis vaporizer dosage pens, has drawn criticism from some Humboldt County cannabis producers. While the company is based in different areas of the state, it obtains its marijuana exclusively from more than 250 farms in Humboldt County \u2014 thus making it compliant with current laws. \n \n\u201cThe best cannabis in the world and the best genetics come from Humboldt County so all of our partner farms are in Humboldt County,\u201d hmbldt CEO Matt Seashols said in a previous interview with the Times-Standard. \n \nMcGuire said the bill was solely directed at closing any loopholes in the legislation regarding branding and labeling. \n \n\u201cIf they source the product from Humboldt then the label will clearly state that,\u201d he said. \n \nWill Houston can be reached at 707-441-0504. \n \nAdvertisement","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Will Houston whouston@times-standard.com @Will_S_Houston on Twitter"},"topics":[{"name":"Illegal drugs news","group":"Society"}],"title":"McGuire bill seeks to bolster marijuana branding protections","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mendocino","zipCode":"95482","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ukiah","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ukiah Daily Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169722760","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"18"},"name":"Ukiah Daily Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB175","http://www.times-standard.com/general-news/20161217/branding-humboldt-cannabis-market-seeks-to-cash-in-regions-recognition?source=most_viewed"],"sequenceId":"695199698017","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:17:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.ukiahdailyjournal.com/storyimage/NP/20170128/NEWS/170129903/AR/0/AR-170129903.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 28 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199706913","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(1/28/17)\u2014 Concordia kicked off its 2017 season by hosting St. Scholastica and while the end result won't show the improvement, the overall play of the six Cobbers will. \n\nConcordia fell 8-1 to the Saints in the season opener at Courts Plus in Fargo but had five of the six singles players earn game wins and sophomore Lisa Neumann earned her first collegiate victory. \n\nLast year the Cobbers went 0-15 and won just one single match all year. Neumann matched that total by recording a decisive 6-1, 6-0 victory at No.2 singles. \n\nNeumann is the showcase for Concordia's improvement as she continually hit winners and used a new-found power to keep her opponent pinned to the baseline. Neumann went 0-15 last year but has stepped up her game for her sophomore season. \n\nJunior Kendra Stoick stepped into the No.1 singles spot this year and battled to a 6-4, 6-0 loss. \n\nBreann Adamek , the other returning player on the 2017 Cobber team, played one of the closest matches of the night. She dropped a 6-2, 6-3 decision at No.5 singles.   \n\nThe other tight bout came at No.6 singles where freshman Talia Dalzell lost 6-2 in the opening set but then got rid of her nerves and narrowly lost 6-4 in the second set. \n\nConcordia dropped all three doubles matches with Stoick and Neumann falling 8-1 at No.1 doubles. \n          \nWHAT'S NEXT: Concordia will stay at home to start the season when they square off against cross-town rival MSU Moorhead on Friday, Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. The Cobbers will then head to Bemdji to take on Bemidji State and St. Benedict on Sunday, Feb. 5.  \n \nSt. Scholastica 8, Concordia-Moorhead 1 \nJan 28, 2017 at Fargo, N.D.

former Five Star Music act now Alter Plate CEO Harrysong and her label manager Desmond Ike-Chima have been forced to pen down a statement where they call KCee confused and talentless\n\nAccording to NigeriaNow the statement reads A famous saying goes this way \u2018a confused man is much more an angry and frustrated man To be honest going by my newest resolve to not for any reason celebrate mediocrity laziness and talentless people I would have chosen to be quiet and pretend as if nothing happened yesterday January 27 2017 but giving my role as a journalist as well as a high ranking member of Nigeria\u2019s most talked about music company Alterplate I have been \u2018arm twisted\u2019 sort of to write this statement and to formerly address the concerns of our friends well wishers family and fans who are currently savoring our newest sound Samankwe It was 8 am and Policemen acting on the instruction of the Assistant Inspector General of Police in Onikan stormed our hotel room to invite Harrysong over for questioning As a law abiding citizen with nothing to fear we got dressed up and set out for the AIGs office and on getting there we were greeted by the presence of a haggard looking young man in cheap pair of suit identified as Five Star Music lawyer His awfully shallow reasoning became so evident when he was called up to defend the petition he prepared on behalf of his client Five Star Music He suffered a hard time convincing the AIG and his men including a visiting Commissioner why the charges against Harrysong were criminal rather than civil Even before any member of our camp could voice a word the visiting commissioner from the way he sounded a very learned and experienced officer frowned at the concocted charges and recommended that they drop the petition and rather file a suit in a civil court instead of bringing the Police into the picture In view of the lies peddled on some social media platforms I wish to state here clearly that 1 Harrysong was never whisked away by some mobile police officers to an unknown location 2 It wasn\u2019t an arrest but an invitation by the AIG a high ranking police officer which he honoured 3 A supposed breach of contract as captured in their petition is a civil and not a criminal case On the other hand as against the kangaroo statement released by Five Star music earlier today I wish to also state that Harrysong did not at any time approach anyone or company to sign him it was rather the other way round Kcee approached Harrysong on bended knees to help salvage his dying career after he fell out with his then partner As much as Harrysong loved to help him out in that time of need it is worthy of note that 1 He Kcee was talentless and knows next to nothing about music 2 Harrysong had a running contract with Questionmark Records but out of desperation Kcee and his Five Star Music were prepared to pay off Kelvin Luciano in their quest to have him Harrysong at all cost It would be recalled that Harrysong succeeded in recreating Kcee\u2019s sound wrote and co-produced his first meaningful single \u2018Had it been I know\u2019 followed by \u2018Okpekete\u2019 \u2018Limpopo\u2019 \u2018Pull Over\u2019 and other songs that defined the Kcee that everyone now knows and celebrates today all pro bono For what it\u2019s worth Harrysong\u2019s dealing with Five Star Music was with the clause that he would be left to pursue his career whenever he deemed it fit As the case may be we are not surprised at the turn out of things and why Kcee-led Five Star Music has chosen the way of reproach rather than that of honour The earlier they wake up to the reality that Harrysong had long dumped them in a trash bin and moved on the better for them \u2018cos\u2019 I can tell you for free he is not coming back And to our fans and the general public I wish to apologize on their behalf and to leave you with these words \u2018Kcee is confused and as such frustrated and we can understand\u2019 For the records Alterplate has come to stay and you are free to do business with Harrysong and Alterplate Management we are indeed the real deal -DESMOND

is an ugly development that should give all truly patriotic Nigerians concerns It has to do with the turn of events in the North East of the country which has been the hotbed of the Boko Haram insurgency What is at stake here is the seeming indifference \u2013 if not active undermining \u2013 to the efforts at ending the years of horror the terrorists had visited on the country\n\nThe December 24 2016 capture of Camp Zero in Sambisa Forest globally recognized as Boko Haram\u2019s last stronghold should have provoked a zeal in stakeholders in the area to boldly step forward and deliver the non-combatant components of the anti-terror war to ensure the war is decisively won Not much of such appears to be happening If anything the sense one has is of those in position of authority doing their best to return their sphere of influence back to the era of fear under Boko Haram\u2019s sustained attacks\n\nThis trend is worrisome The stakeholders in the north east particularly those in Borno state cannot continue to expect the whole country to clean up their mess without actively contributing to managing the situation they are largely credited with precipitating Not a few experts have identified crippling poverty as the booster fuel that accelerated the growth of Boko Haram and sustained it \u2013 the poor population of youth without education or employment provide a ready pool of recruits for radicalization and militarization Even though the whole of Nigeria is a developing country with widespread poverty issue the leaders in Borno reportedly created the kind of poverty that is virulent as they diverted the resources meant for that area\u2019s population for personal investments in other states or imitate their counterparts to export their people\u2019s patrimony abroad\n\nIf poverty was the fuel that propelled Boko Haram\u2019s growth the sheer indifference of these stakeholders coupled with their penchant for misleading the issue was the catalyst that allowed it mutate from a ragtag band of cudgel machetes bows and arrows wielding youths to the world most notorious terror group that shames even Daesh ISIS News clippings would easily show that instead of quickly nipping the problem in the bud at its sapling stage Borno politicians were rather exploiting it for their own nefarious ends some went as far as hiring the then emerging terrorists to eliminate their political opponents or at least assassinate their opponents and make the killings appear like Boko Haram attacks\n\nAt a later stage when the group was in mutation into the world\u2019s horror story these stakeholders rather allowed it to fester they milked it for all it is worth by setting up phantom contact groups and phony negotiations that were used to defraud the former administration They supposedly fled their domains simply to qualify for handouts All these streams of funding would dry up if the killer group was defeated so it was desirable for them to keep the attacks in place so long as money and influence keep flowing and the killers know where not to strike\n\nBut that was before Boko Haram became a desirable bride to foreign terrorists organizations and completely went rabid Its fighters turned on even their handlers \u2013 religion ethnic affiliation financial ties and all other previous considerations lost meaning for the now crazed murderers\n\nIt is for this reason that Nigerians must condemn recent reports that Borno Elders particularly those of Kanuri origin are reluctant to back peaceful initiatives being put forward by other stakeholders to bring the entire Boko Haram episode to a desirable close Evidence of this abound in the conflicting stance they take on the issue of moving forward after Nigerian troops decimated decapitated and humiliated the insurgents from their strongholds The escaping fighters continue to attempt staging attacks without Borno Elders deploying their clout to corral them into submission If anything the utterances from these elders appeared to be encouraging the fighters that a re-group is possible\n\nAn immediate and justifiable suspicion is to conclude that these elders are loath to see the last of the terrorists because they are still hopeful of some sort of monetary gain or influence peddling by sustaining Boko Haram as a bargaining chip similar to how elders in the Niger-Delta have declared terrorists militants their \"children\" that are free to run amok This suspicion raises several questions and the answers to these would define the future of human existence in the north east\n\nIn whose interest is the restoration of peace in Borno and the northeast Why have the stakeholders in the north east refused to commit themselves to bringing about lasting peace in the region What is the endgame of these stakeholders How do they want the scenario playing out to end\n\nWhatever the answers are do not in anyway detract from the strength and capabilities of the Nigerian military to bring the ugly scenario in Borno state and environs to a close at some point in time after all the military is an enduring institution that would not go away\n\nBut support from the stakeholders would potentially shorten the time needed for restoring normalcy to the area while reducing further loss of life to lone wolf attacks being staged by escaping terrorists There is no doubt about the military\u2019s might but additional peaceful approaches are needed to bring about the needed peace for the people to heal their wounds and rebuild the region  Guns have never and will never bring people together just as elders are usually the ones with the institutional memory to make this happen\n\nAs opposed to the current situation where the Borno Elders\u2019 response to the military exploits against Boko Haram has been criticism instead of acknowledgement one would like to see and hear them step in to call their clansmen to order and ask them to lay down their arms One does not presently hear them call on their children to lay down their arms and put an end to the soft target ambushes that sadly often catch their own ethnic nationals in the crossfire \u2013 their improvised explosive devices have no capacity to discriminate as to who gets killed when they target helpless and defenseless citizens in the state The fleeing elements still have the capacity to inflict pains on the people and the responsibility now falls in part on Borno Elders and stakeholders in the northeast to come up with workable idea since the military and security cannot be present in every single home\n\nThe state governor Kashim Shettima should show the needed political leadership put more efforts in the peace project by coming up with strategies that the other neighboring states can tap into to revive the entire northern region As the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum Shettima has to do more to see that the fleeing elements are prevailed upon within the shortest period of time to surrender their arms The governor should see how he can galvanize his colleagues to inspire the districts and emirate councils along the line of what the Zurmi Emirate did when it handed over three Boko Haram suspects to the army Once the terrorists realize they have no hiding places even among their own folks they will be encouraged to turn themselves in for reintegration\n\nThe delay on the part of elders and stakeholders in kicking off such initiative is not one that should prolong inaction through self recriminations On the internet for the first time in history of the insurgency we saw videos on YouTube inviting Nigerians and the rest of the world to the first Mega Rally for Peace in the North East region of Nigeria right in Governor Shettima\u2019s backyard It is an initiative he should take over if only to ensure that it can record more success in restoring normalcy to the state by pressuring the terrorists on the lose to give up\n\nFor the Borno Elders this laudable initiative for now is the best news to come out of Maiduguri in the year 2017 It could as well be the pathway for finding redemption for their previous failings The peace efforts while not initiated by them must not be jeopardized for political exigencies Other Nigerians want peace all around and that would not be possible if peace does not reign in the northeast\n\nKolawole PhD a University lecturer contributed this article from Keffi Top Stories","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria

It\u2019s what we\u2019re consumed with. For us it would be disingenuous to write about anything else.\u201d \n \nFor past albums, Cochran said the group focused on working together, just the five of them, throughout the writing process. To switch things up, he said the group invited other people to be a part of their writing process for the upcoming album. \n \nThe band wanted their fans to feel a special connection with this newest album, Cochran said, so they created several ways for fans to be involved via pledgemusic.com. \n \nThe website lets fans get access to exclusive updates and previews to new songs, band merchandise and memorabilia from creating the album. \n \nUnique offerings on the site include a \u201cVIP Studio Visit\u201d with the band in Nashville, including a private listening party, Q&A session, photo op, autographed CD, signed colored vinyl and T-shirt. \n \nOther packages include signed memorabilia or an undeveloped disposable camera filled with photos taken by the band while in the studio or on the road. \n \nBesides the Texas tour and a few shows this spring, the band\u2019s next project is performing at a couple\u2019s retreat, the Love Song Couples Getaway, at Grand Hyatt Kaua\u2019i Resort and Spa in Kauai, Hawaii, from May 28 to June 3. \n \nCochran said the band has participated in the event a few times, in various locations, and the performers think it\u2019s a great escape for couples. \n \nMixing work and their personal lives, the bandmates even bring their wives along to enjoy the retreat. \n \nThey have slowed down on touring over the years, going from an average of 120 shows a year to about 60 or 70. \n \nCochran said the group decided early on that finding the balance between work and life in a band would be nearly impossible. Collectively, they decided the band would come second, behind their families. \n \nWhile they might be performing less and less in an effort to be present with their growing families, Cochran said they don\u2019t take for granted the opportunity they\u2019ve been given to share a message that is near and dear to their hearts. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re serious about our relationship with Christ. If we really take that relationship seriously and really truly believe that he\u2019s changed our lives, then we certainly want to talk about that with people,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been ones to slap people upside the head with a Bible, but at the same time we want to be honest that this is the only thing that has actually changed our lives \u2014 is our relationship with Christ.

We understand to beat the good teams we just had to sharpen up a little.\u201d \n \nAnd the struggling ones too. Blossomgame scored 25 points on 10 of 14 shooting and Gabe DeVoe hit a pair of buckets to fend off a late Pittsburgh surge as the Tigers topped the sliding Panthers 67-60 on Saturday. \n \nThe Tigers (12-8, 2-6 ACC) won for the first time in 2017 by holding Pitt to just 32 percent (18 of 55) shooting and keeping it together after the Panthers trimmed a 10-point deficit to 60-57 with 4:35 left. DeVoe knocked down a turnaround jumper and then slipped into the lane for a putback. Clemson\u2019s defense \u2014 yes, it\u2019s defense \u2014 did the rest. \n \nPitt made just 5 of 28 shots in the second half and missed its final five shots over the final 2:33. \n \n\u201cWe were just really locked in defensively,\u201d Blossomgame said. \n \n\u201cThey were shots that we wanted them to take and fortunately they missed them.\u201d \n \nJamel Artis and Cameron Johnson led Pitt with 16 points each, but the Panthers (12-9, 1-7 ACC) lost their sixth straight. Four days after falling to Louisville at home by 55 points, Pitt responded with better effort but not better results while falling into last place by itself in the nation\u2019s toughest conference. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that we shot as poorly as we did in the second half and we had a chance to win the game,\u201d coach Kevin Stallings said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well enough to win but certainly played a lot harder.\u201d \n \nThen again, there was nowhere to go but up. \n \nThe Panthers wore alternate all-black uniforms as part of a promotion set up months ago, with Stallings and the entire student section following suit. The timing could have been better. Stallings\u2019 already difficult first year hit rock bottom on Tuesday night when visiting the visiting Cardinals won by the largest margin of victory by a road team in the 64-year history of the league, a setback that left the Panthers shaken. \n \nPitt brought in reinforcements, with football coach Pat Narduzzi \u2014 who orchestrated a 43-42 upset over the Tigers in November that proved to be Clemson\u2019s only loss on the way to the national title \u2014 trying to whip the Petersen Events Center into a frenzy. \n \nIt worked for \u201cThe Oakland Zoo.\u201d Not so much the Panthers. \n \nPitt got off to a slow start but rallied to take a 36-31 lead at the break following a deep 3-pointer by Artis. It didn\u2019t last. Clemson went on a 12-0 run to start the second half fueled by Blossomgame. The Tigers eventually went up 50-40 after a pretty turnaround jumper by Marcquise Reed. \n \nClemson, however, has struggled to put teams away this season. Four of the Tigers\u2019 previous six losses in conference came by five points or less. This time Clemson found a way behind Blossomgame. \n \n\u201cJaron made big plays for us in the second half, which you need your best players to do,\u201d Clemson coach Brad Brownwell said. \n \nThe Tigers haven\u2019t bailed mentally following a difficult stretch and didn\u2019t lose their composure even though Pitt crept back in it despite being outplayed. The big shots by DeVoe certainly helped. \n \n\u201cThat was definitely a winning play,\u201d Blossomgame said. \u201cEverybody expects me to have the ball. For Gabe to produce like that in crunch time is huge.\u201d \n \nStallings lamented his lack of options when asked about taking playing time away from his four seniors but experimented liberally with his bench. Rozelle Nix, Damon Wilson, Justice Kithcart, Corey Manigault and Jonathan Milligan all saw minutes in the first half and came in as a mass substitution in the second half, though that appearance ended after less than two minutes following a pair of empty possessions and two quick Clemson baskets. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to keep guys in anymore that aren\u2019t at least attempting to do their very best at what we asked them to do,\u201d Stallings said. \n \nPitt begins a three-game road trip with a visit to No. 9 North Carolina on Tuesday followed by a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium on Saturday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"PITT BASKETBALL: Sliding Panthers drop sixth straight","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199716402","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:40:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

colleagues don\u2019t have much else to do There hasn\u2019t been a single customer since December when neighbouring Nigeria banned car imports by land as part of a wave of protectionist policies that are strangling Benin\u2019s economy\n\n\"We spend our days smoking it\u2019s our life now\" Hijazi sighs sitting in a gazebo beside his stock of thousands of cars steadily accumulating the dry winter dust\n\nThis afternoon Hijazi \u2014 who like the vast majority of car dealers in Benin is Lebanese \u2014 called in his Beninese accountant to help close up shop\n\nDebts are accumulating and the stress is becoming too much \"I lost in one year what I have earned in 16\" Ali Assi another car dealer told AFP\n\nOf the 2500 Lebanese dealers in Cotonou 1600 have packed up and left in the last six months shutting down businesses that employed dozens of drivers cleaners and security staff\n\n\"Unemployed people used to come here to find work\" said Vincent Gouton who represents a group of car dealership managers in Cotonou\n\nThe Benin car market began its free fall last year when neighbouring Nigeria entered its first recession since 1994\n\nNigeria an economic behemoth of 190 million people gobbles up \"99 percent of car exports\" in Benin according to Gouton\n\nBenin a tiny country with scarce natural resources relies on its port business to survive\n\nFrom the port city of Cotonou imported cars fabrics and food from all over the world get distributed across west Africa\n\nBut since the Nigerian economy crashed following the collapse in global oil prices Benin has been suffering knock-on effects\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s protectionist policies \u2014 his government has banned a slew of items including cars imported by land \u2014 has only aggravated the situation\n\n\u2013\u2018Encourage smuggling\u2019\u2013 \n\n\"This decision will encourage smuggling it\u2019s back to square one\" Gouton said\n\nSeveral agreements were signed in the past between Benin and Nigeria to facilitate legal trade\n\nBut Nigeria accuses Beninese customs of failing to monitor the exported goods and collect taxes\n\nBuhari hopes that closing land borders will revitalise Nigerian industries and attract business to the port at Lagos Nigeria\u2019s economic capital and largest city\n\nToday over 20 products \u2014 the list has never been officially published \u2014 are banned from being imported overland\n\n\"For the past 18 months we have seen a lot of policies that are not market friendly\" said Nigerian economist Nonso Obikili\n\n\"The self-sufficiency policy has led the government to create all sorts of hostile environments around import\" Obikili said\n\n\"The government wants to ban palm oil imports but our plantations are not ready to meet local demand and it takes two years to get oil from trees It\u2019s a mess\" Obikili told AFP\n\n\"And this will encourage illegal trade\"\n\n\u2013\u2018Killing business\u2019\u2013 \n\nIt isn\u2019t just Benin which is hurting\n\nNigerian car dealer Olabanji Akinola said he had to fire half of his employees last week as a result of the ban\n\nBusiness used to be brisk at

The Warriors would come back to win the night cap 3-2 to earn the doubleheader split in the first games of the season for both teams. \n \nIn game 1, Tech got on the scoreboard in the top of the fourth inning. Tech loaded the bases with no outs, Michael Kilpatrick delivered a big RBI single scoring Alexis Paz for the game and season\u2019s first run. OIT added a run in the top of the 5 th to take a 2-0 lead as Louis Wolf hit an RBI single to left field scoring Ryan Riepma who had walked to get the rally going. \n\nWilliam Jessup chipped in a run in the bottom of the 6 th to make it a 2-1 game. Tech quickly answered as Zavala smashed a double down the left line scoring Kai Fong who singled to lead off the inning, giving OIT a 3-1 lead.  \n \nOIT took a 4-1 in the top of the 8 th as Wolf tripled and scored on Kilpatrick\u2019s third hit of the game, a double left-center.  \n \nJessup made it interesting as they got a homerun from Rory Peterson to close the gap to 4-2 heading to the 9 th .  \n \nIn the 9 th , the Warriors scored 1-run on 2-hits but Tech\u2019s Ben Hood was able to pick up the save as he struck-out 3 batters, closing the door on the Warriors\u2019 rally and preserving the 4-3 win for the Owls \n\nKandra was brilliant in his 2017 pitching debut, throwing 5 scoreless innings and allowing only two hits as he earned the win to start the year at 1-0.  \n \nKilpatrick led the Owls with 3-hits, with Zavala and Wolf adding 2-hits each in the win.  \n \nIn game 2, Tech pulled off a double-steal in the top of the first to take a 1-0 lead; with runners on first and third, Zavala stole second base and Fong stole home.  \n \nPeterson hit his 2 nd home run in as many games to tie the game for William Jessup in the bottom of the first. OIT then took the lead back 2-1 in the top of the second, taking advantage of 2-walks and an error.  \n \nThe Warriors scored 2-runs in the bottom of the 4 th on 2-hits, a walk and wild pitch to take a 3-2 lead.  \n \nNeither team was able to muster any offense the rest of the way as William Jessup held on for the 3-2 win.  \n \nTech was held to just 2-hits in the loss, with starting pitcher John Schulz getting stuck with the tough loss throwing 6-innings and only giving up 3-hits with 5-strikeouts.  \n \nThe two teams will wrap up the series with a doubleheader scheduled for an 11:00 am start in Rocklin, California.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: baseball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: athletics news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"OIT Baseball Earns a Split to Open-up the 2017 Season","source":{"category":"Academic","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Oregon Tech","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609961409","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Oregon Tech","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Athletics","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oit.edu"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199719848","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

So did Porter\u2019s nephew. \n \nIt\u2019s safe to say that there aren\u2019t many people in the North Catholic community who are sorry to see the parents go. \n \nBy all accounts, the kids weren\u2019t the problem. \n \nJoey Porter was a big problem. \n \nHe made a spectacle of himself at home and on the road, even though he was with his head coach at the time. \n \nDuring a game at Riverside in October, Porter ran onto the field to badger the officials. Remember, he\u2019s a Steelers assistant coach and only a North Catholic parent. \n \nNorth Catholic was penalized 15 yards and the officials asked the North Sewickley police to remove Porter. According to eyewitnesses, Porter told the cops, \u201cIf you want me to leave it\u2019s gonna take more than just you.\u201d \n \nThe officers working the game had to call for extra help. \n \nPorter finally calmed down when the referee threatened North Catholic with a forfeit. \n \nMike Tomlin was also at the game, but not involved in the disturbance. But Tomlin did, on at least one occasion, according to a witness, pay a visit to the North Catholic locker room and drop multiple F-bombs while trashing the officials. \n \nAnd during a home game at J.C. Stone Field, Tomlin and Porter were less than cooperative with Allegheny County police when they were asked to move away from a fence where they were obstructing the view of some fans. \n \nThe game ended before the cops had to remove them. \n \nHere\u2019s what an NFL head coach or an NFL assistant coach should do in the stands at their kids\u2019 high school football game: hide. \n \nShut up. \n \nAnd that doesn\u2019t change if the head coach happens to be a former NFL player and/or a former teammate. \n \nHave some respect for the officials, the opposing players and the parents of your sons\u2019 teammates. And be aware of the responsibility that goes with representing the Steelers in public. \n \nSneak in and sneak out. Do whatever it takes to draw as little attention to yourself as possible. That would include not smoking cigars in a non-smoking stadium and causing fans to leave their seats, which Tomlin and Porter are said to have done at a playoff game in Butler. \n \nComforting yourselves with dignity would seem like an even better idea when your boss is a graduate of the school where your kids are playing. \n \nDan Rooney is a North Catholic alum. So is Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert, who\u2019s on the board of directors. \n \nTomlin and Porter deciding to take their kids out of North Catholic could mean a fight over their eligibility next season. Kids who transfer with \u201cathletic intent\u201d are required to sit out a season. North Catholic would have to agree to give its permission. This would seem to be a classic case of athletic intent. \n \nI have a feeling the two Steelers coaches are going to expect their kids to be eligible next season. \n \nStay tuned. \n \n\u2022 Now that the New England Patriots have done what they almost always do and knocked the Steelers out of the playoffs, here are some numbers from last week\u2019s AFC championship. \n \nTom Brady completed 32 passes. Seventeen of them went less than 5 yards in the air. Nine of them 32 traveled more than 10 yards. \n \nWhile Steelers fans are looking forward to the return of wide receiver Martavis Bryant because of his ability to stretch the field, up in New England, Bill Belichick is getting reports on short, quick, sure-handed receivers who he can use to dink-and-dunk his opponents to death. \n \nHow can anyone who watched the Patriots\u2019 offense not want to copy it? Belichick\u2019s system is impossible to stop. If they had traded quarterbacks before the game, do you think the Steelers would have won with Tom Brady? \n \nNot a chance. \n \nIn the first quarter, Brady threw a 6-yard pass to Julian Edelman that he turned into a 41-yard gain. Ben Roethlisberger, on third-and-1 on the Steelers\u2019 first possession, threw a picture-perfect 40-yard pass to Sammie Coates running down the sideline. It\u2019s not humanly possible to throw a football any better. \n \nCoates dropped it. \n \nOn the stat sheet, Brady was 1-for-1 for 41 yards, Roethlisberger was 0-for-1. When Brady wasn\u2019t throwing passes to Edelman that could have been completed in your living room, he was completing passes to a wide-open former lacrosse player. \n \nDink. Dunk. Super Bowl. \n \nBrady might still be doing it when he\u2019s 5","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Pros need to show respect in public","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199725345","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump told reporters even as the sweeping immigration order caused chaos and confusion at airports across the country, triggering widespread protests. \n \nHe, however, denied that barring refugees from several predominantly Muslim nations amounted to a ban on Muslims. \n \n\"It's not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared,\" Trump told reporters after he signed three more executive orders related to lobbying ban, plan to defeat ISIS and reorganisation of National Security Council. \n \nPresident Trump yesterday ordered \"extreme vetting\" of people entering the US from seven Muslim-majority countries and banned the entry of Syrian refugees until further notice, as part of new measures to \"keep radical Islamic terrorists\" out of America. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. \n \nThe controversial move, signed a week after he was sworn- in as the President, fulfills the vow Trump made on the campaign trail to limit Muslim immigration to the US. \n \nThe immigration order, however, hit a roadblock when a federal judge today issued an emergency order temporarily barring authorities from deporting refugees and other visa holders who have been detained. \n \nEarlier, a senior Administration official also pushed back on the notion that the controversial executive order was a Muslim ban. \n \nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the official listed off several predominantly Muslim countries that the order does not apply to. \n \nThe official said the US still took in \"more foreigners than any other country in the history of civilisation\" and that the number of people impacted by the executive order was relatively small. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \n \n\"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the US,\" the official added. \n \nGreen Card holders from one of the seven affected countries who are currently outside the US will need a case by case waiver to return to America, according to the official. \n \nThose Green Card holders in the US will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, the official said. \n \nThe official said the administration is still working to define what \"in transit\" means for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the US but are currently in a third country. \n \n\"The White House is aware of reports that Iran plans reciprocal steps in response to the executive order,\" the official said, adding if those measures are indeed reciprocal, it means that the Iranians will review each individual on a case by case basis. \n \nTrump s executive orders signed yesterday imposes a five year lobbying ban on administration officials and a lifetime ban on administration officials lobbying for a foreign country. \n \nThe other executive action calls on military leaders to present a report to the president in 30 days that outlines a strategy for defeating ISIS.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"It's not a Muslim ban, Trump defends immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Kaumudi","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170611974","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"56"},"name":"Kaumudi","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kaumudi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199728655","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Westchester","zipCode":"10583","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Scarsdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sachem Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169732655","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sachem Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sachem.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199728939","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Both were terrific from the back and at the net too. \n \nSania was also broken in the third game.

President on any refugees coming to the U.S., an indefinite ban on any Syrian refugees, and a 90-day ban on any people, period, coming here from the predominantly Muslim nations of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump argued that foreigners from these nations pose a terrorist threat to the U.S.\n\nOn Saturday an estimated 100-200 legal U.S. residents returning to the country from abroad were detained at airports throughout the U.S. because of the order, with plans to deport them. The detainees included residents with green cards, students with visas to attend school here, travelers returning from trips.\n\nThen, Saturday night, a federal judge in Brooklyn ordered a temporary halt to those deportations. She acted on a motion for a stay drafted by a team of Yale Law School students who had been working non-stop since Friday night in concert with other attorneys and civil-liberties groups around the nation. (The ruling did not order the arrivals to be allowed into the country.)\n\n\u201cWe were extremely excited that it worked,\u201d said Elizabeth Willis, one of 20 Yale law students on the team. She plans to become an immigration lawyer after finishing her studies next spring.\n\n\u201cWe felt that we were able to use the law to bring at least a small amount of justice to people whose rights were violated ... and push back against these kinds of unconstitutional acts.\u201d\n\nThe temporary stay does not affect the ban on accepting new refugees.\n\nA Syrian refugee family made it to New Haven just in time Thursday, before the executive order. The family of five is the latest to be brought here through New Haven\u2019s Integrated Refugee & Immigration Services (IRIS). A coalition of local synagogues, called the Jewish Community Alliance for Refugee Settlement (JCARR), is helping the family get settled.\n\nAnother dozen or so refugee families \u2014 including from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Congo \u2014 had been approved to arrived in the next two to three weeks, according to IRIS Executive Director Chris George. Trump\u2019s executive order kills those plans. The order also kills the plans of relatives to join some families who have already settled here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gut-wrenching. It\u2019s shameful,\u201d George said of Trump\u2019s order. His agency resettled 477 refugees, including 279 fleeing the brutal civil war in Syria, in Connecticut during the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 New Haven\u2019s refugee families \u201cfeel these executive orders are a major shift in American attitudes toward refugees. The are afraid they\u2019ve come to a country that\u2019s not as welcoming as they thought,\u201d George said.\n\nAt the same time, George said, he is \u201cso encouraged\u201d by the support that has flowed form throughout the state for IRIS and the refugee families this week \u2014 including the work of attorneys to win the temporary stay against part of Trump\u2019s order.\n\nThe call for help to New Haven came at 10 p.m. Friday., around five hours after Trump signed his executive order.\n\nRebecca Heller made the call. She runs the International Refugee Assistance Project Urban Justice Center out of New York. She is a graduate of Yale Law School, where she worked in the student clinic, the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization.\n\nShe was calling Professor and specializes in immigration cases. She told Wishnie that authorities were holding an Iraqi man, who legally resides in the U.S., at the airport because of the order.\n\nIt turned out two Iraqi men were being detained. One was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an interpreter who had done work for the U.S. military in Iraq from 2003 to 2013. His work \u201cplaced him in substantial risk of being targeted, attacked and killed by anti-American militias and insurgents,\u201d in the words of a petition Wishnie and his students would soon write. The other man was Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who had obtained permission to relocate here to join the rest of his family in Texas. Alshawi, an accountant, worked for a U.S. contractor, Falcon Security Group,from 2006 to 2007, and has been targeted as a suspected collaborator by insurgents, according to the petition.\n\nWishnie\u2019s students got to work right away. A first group began drafting a petition for a writ of habeus corpus on behalf of the two men and others being detained at airports across the country. Some of the students slept as little as two hours. (Click here to read the petition.)\n\nA second group began in the morning to draft an emergency motion for a stay of removal and a legal memorandum supporting it. In the memorandum, they argued that, among other constitutional violations, Trump\u2019s order \u201cexpressly discriminates against Petitioners on the basis of their country of origin and was substantially motivated by animus toward Muslims, in violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d The memo also argued that the order \u201cviolated procedural requirements of the Fifth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act by seeking to return Petitioners and members of the proposed class to their home countries without the opportunity to present claims for asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection.\u201d The memo added that the two men \u201clikely face serious bodily harm, persecution, and death absent a stay of removal.\u201d\n\nClick here to read the memorandum.\n\nAs the students worked, lawyers were mobilizing all over the country, visiting the airports and helping detainees. Support rallies sprung up as well.\n\nThe law students\u2019 drafts went to lawyers across the country, as well, for revisions.\n\nAfter the petition was filed, the two Iraqi men were released. But many more people remained in detention at U.S. airports.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers from the ACLU argued the motion for the stay of removal before U.S. District Court Judge Ann M. Donnelly at 7:30 p.m. On a half-hour notice, activists organized supporters to rush to courtroom to demonstrate.\n\nAround 9 p.m., Judge Donnelly issued a one-page ruling granting the stay. Donnelly, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, wrote that the petitioners stand \u201ca strong likelihood of success\u201d in proving that their removal violates their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection; and that \u201crefugees, visa-holders and other individuals from nations subject\u201d to Trump\u2019s order face \u201cimminent danger\u201d of \u201csubstantial and irreparable injury.\u201d\n\nThe full immediate effect of the stay was unclear around midnight. Wishnie and Willis said reports were coming in that detainnes ahd been released from airports in Boston, Chicago and Atlanta. They\u2019d heard that at other airports detainees may still face deportation because attorneys haven\u2019t had access to them, but that information couldn\u2019t be confirmed.\n\nTwo results of the stay were clear, though.\n\nThe Yale students had helped win a swift short-term victory in prevent a president from taking what they consider unconstitutional and discriminatory action.\n\nAnd the bigger battles remain to be waged \u2014 including the Yale law team\u2019s quest for a broader ruling deeming the executive order unconstitutional.\n\nAlso Saturday night, Yale officials emailed the university community to update members on efforts to monitor the impact of Trump\u2019s executive order on students abroad.\n\nFollowing is the text of the email:\n\nTo the members of the Yale community:\n\nAn executive order signed by President Trump on Friday restricting the entry of individuals from seven countries into the United States may affect members of our community. We share in your concern regarding this situation and assure the community that we are working closely with students and scholars who are directly affected.\n\nWe are also in touch with our colleagues at other universities and the Association of American Universities (AAU), of which Yale is a member. The AAU has issued a statement urging a quick end to the administrative order barring returning students and faculty from certain countries, available here. We will continue to monitor the situation and to explore the best options available in response.\n\nMore information is on the website of the Office of International Students and Scholars and will be updated regularly.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPeter Salovey, President and Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology\n\nBenjamin Polak, Provost and William C. Brainard Professor of Economics\n\nKimberly Goff-Crews, Secretary and Vice President for Student Life","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Paul Bass"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Law Students Help Halt Deportations","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"New Haven","zipCode":"06515","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New Haven","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"New Haven Independent","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659353","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"31"},"name":"New Haven Independent","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Law","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newhavenindependent.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news","https://www.crowdrise.com/jcarr","http://www.aau.edu/news/article.aspx?id=18366","http://oiss.yale.edu/immigration-policy-under-the-new-administration"],"sequenceId":"695199731568","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:23:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/upload/2016/02/paul/michael_wishnie_-_1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Google has outlined design, functionality, performance and stability as well as publishing requirements for apps to qualify as Daydream-ready. This means Daydream users will have access to a lot more app options from different developers. Initially, only apps from select partners were made available on the Play Store. Plus, the company is working on its VR platform to compete with the likes of Samsung Gear VR and Facebook\u2019s Oculus; which have already made their way in to global markets. Daydream features a separate motion controller and is compatible by default with Android 7.1 Nougat. Daydream will be compatible with a wide array of smartphones when OEMs start supporting Daydream.\n\nGoogle announced Daydream View, its first Daydream compatible VR headset, in October. As of now, the apps and games on Daydream are powered by more than 50 partners. Smartphones such as Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Moto Z and Moto Z Force support Google\u2019s Daydream platform. The Daydream View is available at Verizon, Best Buy and the Google Store in the US. Google\u2019s Daydream VR headset supports Netflix VR \u2013 a standalone app \u2013 that gives access to Netflix\u2019s 2D content. It allows users to view Netflix shows and movies via Daydream View on a big screen TV in a virtual cabin. Google recently added support for apps such as HBO NOW and HBO GO on its Daydream platform. Just like Netflix, HBO shows can only be viewed in 2D for now.

On his first full day in office, Jan. 20, 1993, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order titled, \" Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees .\" Twenty four years, a week and a day later, President Trump signed an order bearing the exact same title . \n \nBut the similarities don't stop there. As Trump's team drafted his order on ethics, they appear to have borrowed heavily from the language used in orders signed by both Clinton and President Obama . Obama also pulled from Clinton, in parts, but that's perhaps less surprising given they were presidents of the same party. Perhaps more importantly, Trump not only seems to be lifting from those presidents' language, but they are presidents he has condemned, including for not \"draining the swamp.\" \n \nIt should be noted that Clinton ended up revoking his order in his final weeks in office, allowing his appointees to go straight into lobbying after all. And the Obama administration granted some waivers to its ethics order. It remains to be seen, of course, if Trump sticks hard and fast to his ban. \n \nTrump criticized Clinton for backing off the ban during the 2016 presidential campaign. \"President Clinton did what the Clintons always do \u2014 he rigged the system on his way out,\" Trump said in a statement in October of last year. \"Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.\" (Podesta was Clinton's chief of staff in the White House, founded a lobbying and public affairs firm with his brother and later became Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman.) \n \nThe Trump administration did not reply to a request for comment. \n \n\"When a new president's executive order deals with a subject of operational concern to multiple administrations, it's not surprising that the president's lawyers would look to previous iterations as models,\" wrote Peter Shane, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor, in an email to NPR after reviewing the overlapping language. Shane focuses on separation of powers law and the application of law to the presidency. \n \n\"For a Republican president, reiterating the restrictive obligations prior Democratic presidents imposed on their appointees has the double advantage of using provisions vetted by other lawyers and apparently deemed acceptable to the political opposition,\" Shane added. \n \nBelow, we were able to trace back each bullet point in section one of Trump's order to either Clinton or Obama \u2014 nearly verbatim. For clarity, Trump's order language is in bold, Clinton's is in italics and Obama's is plain text: \n\n \nTrump: \n\n  \n\"Section 1. Ethics Pledge.

I understand that the terms of this pledge are in addition to any statutory or other legal restrictions applicable to me by virtue of Federal Government service.\" \n\n  \nInterestingly, when it came to picking language for the \"waivers\" section of the order, Trump's team chose the language used by Clinton, with one notable exception. Trump's executive order doesn't require waivers to be published in the Federal Register, meaning it will be harder for the public and press to determine whether the Trump administration is taking advantage of the loopholes written into the executive order. Obama's order didn't require the waivers to be published in the Federal Register either. \n \nTrump: \n\n  \n\"Sec. 3. Waiver.

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a 'caliphate'. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\" Trump said in his executive order. \n \n\"For those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\" he said. \n \nThe plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group. \n \nTrump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. \n \n\"If ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\" he warned. \n \n\"We know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability. It continues to radicalise our own citizens, and its attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount. \n \nThe US must take decisive action to defeat ISIS,\" Trump said. The terror group is responsible for the violent murder of American citizens in the Middle East, including the beheading of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig, as well as the death of Kayla Mueller, the executive order notes, the executive order said. \n \nIn addition, ISIS has inspired attacks in the United States, including the December 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, and the June 2016 attack in Orlando, Florida, it said. \n \n\"ISIS is complicit in a number of terrorist attacks on our allies in which Americans have been wounded or killed, such as the November 2015 attack in Paris, France, the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, the July 2016 attack in Nice, France, and the December 2016 attack in Berlin, Germany,\" said the executive order. \n \nThe plan seeks public diplomacy, information operations, and cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimise ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology; identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and policies to empower coalition partners to fight ISIS and its affiliates; and mechanisms to cut off or seize ISIS's financial support, including financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump gives US military 30 days to prepare anti-ISIS strategy","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199742925","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The six other countries are: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the White House said.\n\n\"I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,\" Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon.\n\n\"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\" he said. Civil rights groups condemned the measures as discriminatory, and said they would strand refugees in dangerous places and would tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land welcoming of immigrants.\n\nThe details of the order - which had been rumored for days - were not available until Friday evening, leaving people affected scrambling to figure out what it meant.\n\nThe impact was immediate, causing \"chaos\" for Arab-Americans who had family members already en route for a visit, said Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n\nAyoub said the order could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others.\n\nThe order is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants.\n\nSmyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. \"Those two 18-year-old daughters won't be able to join their mother in the U.S.,\" she said. Trump had promised the measures - called \"extreme vetting\" - during last year's election campaign, saying they would prevent militants from entering the United States from abroad.\n\nThe rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, which fueled a flood of migrants into Europe, combined with a series of attacks in France and Belgium heightened concerns in the United States about taking in refugees from Syria.\n\nTrump's order suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution. Trump said in an interview with a Christian news outlet the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there.\n\nStephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said prioritizing Christians could be unconstitutional.\n\n\"If they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,\" he said.\n\nBut Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump's action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions.\n\n\"It's a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,\" Spiro said.\n\nTrump's order had been expected to include a directive about setting up \"safe zones\" for Syrian refugees inside the country, but no such language was included.\n\n\"President Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\" said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump suspends U.S. refugee program","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Sowetan","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674840","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"143"},"name":"Sowetan","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sowetanlive.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199746800","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/incoming/2017/01/21/inauguration7.jpg/ALTERNATES/mobile1024x720/inauguration7.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

The United States has always attracted and benefited from international scientific talent because of these principles. \n \n\u201cThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world\u2019s largest general science society, has consistently encouraged international cooperation between scientists. We know that fostering safe and responsible conduct of research is essential for scientific advancement, national prosperity, and international security. Therefore, the detaining of students and scientists that have already been screened, processed, and approved to receive a visa to visit the United States is contrary to the spirit of science to pursue scholarly and professional interests. In order for science and the economy to prosper, students and scientists must be free to study and work with colleagues in other countries.   \n \n\u201cThe January 27, 2017 White House executive order on visas and immigration will discourage many of the best and brightest international students, scholars, and scientists from studying and working in the United States, or attending academic and scientific conferences. Implementation of this policy compromises the United States\u2019 ability to attract international scientific talent and maintain scientific and economic leadership. It is in our national interest to take a balanced approach to immigration that protects national security interests and advances our scientific leadership.  \n \n\u201cAfter the tragic events of September 11, 2001, as restrictions on immigration and foreign national travel were put in place to safeguard our national security, AAAS and other organizations worked closely with the Bush administration to advise on a balanced approach. We strongly recommend a similar discussion with officials in the Trump administration.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"AAAS CEO Responds to Trump Immigration and Visa Order","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AAAS","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"178012042","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"967"},"name":"AAAS","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aaas.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199755398","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Per a statement from the team, he will not participate in basketball activities for 2-3 days, but will be re-evaluated Monday. The timing allows for the possibility that Randle wouldn\u2019t miss any more game and could be available Tuesday when the Lakers host Denver. \n \nD\u2019Angelo Russell, however, is showing signs that he could be ready to face the Nuggets. A Lakers spokesman said the team is \u201chopeful\u201d that Russell will be able to practice Sunday, which could pave the way for Russell\u2019s return to the court two nights later. \n \nRussell has missed the last three games with a strained right calf and a sprained MCL in his right knee. He was originally expected to be out 1-2 weeks. \n \nRandle has started all 44 games he has played in for the Lakers, averaging 13 points, 8.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists. He had struggled in recent appearances, however, scoring in double figures just once in his last six games and snaring 10 rebounds just once in seven games. \n \nRussell is the Lakers\u2019 second-leading scorer, averaging 14.3 points per game. He leads the Lakers with 4.4 assists per game. \n \nThe Lakers took advantage of the rare break in the schedule, practicing neither Friday \u2014 typical after playing back-to-back games \u2014 or Saturday. \n \nFollowing Thursday\u2019s 96-88 loss to the Jazz, coach Luke Walton said the Lakers would benefit from the rest. \n \n\u201cI think it will be good for some of our guys,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of our guys are beaten down a little bit, hopefully get D\u2019Angelo, Julius back and get some good practice time in. We\u2019re a young team so the more practice time we get, normally we\u2019re pretty sharp after that.\u201d \n \nWith the exception of the All-Star weekend, which this year will stretch from Feb. 16-23 for the Lakers, this weekend marks the longest remaining span between games for the Lakers. After playing the Nuggets on Tuesday they will head East for five games in 10 days. \n \nThe extended break could also be an opportunity for Walton and his staff to tinker with lineups, with a special eye toward the point guard spot in the event Russell remains sidelined. Two games ago, Walton moved Jose Calderon into the starting lineup and Brandon Ingram, his first choice to take Russell\u2019s spot, back to the bench. \n \n \nSince then, neither player has scored in a combined 70 minutes on the court. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll obviously be on the drawing board and depending on D\u2019Angelo\u2019s situation,\u201d Walton said. \u201cWe like Jose or (Marcelo Huertas) out there just because they\u2019re point guards, so even when they\u2019re not scoring they help settle us in and get us into our offense.\u201d \n \nRandlel\u2019s availability also creates a question mark at power forward. On Thursday, Walton turned to Tarik Black, who tallied just four points, two rebounds, a block and a steal in a season-high 31 minutes. \n \n\u201cI thought that Tarik was good honestly,\u201d Walton said. \u201cMainly on the defensive end. Defensively more than anything he was really helpful.\u201d \n Motivating Mozgov  \nOne subplot to rookie center Ivica Zubac\u2019s recent statistical surge is what it could mean for starter Timofey Mozgov. After signing a four-year, $64 million contract in the summer, Mozgov has struggled to make his mark with the Lakers. \n \nWalton acknowledged that it was possible Zubac\u2019s success, including back-to-back double-doubles last week, could serve as a bit of a wake-up call to Mozgov. \n \n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Walton said. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature when someone behind you is playing as well as Zu\u2019s been playing well for us.\u201d \n \nMozgov is averaging 7.6 points, 5 rebounds and less than one block per game in 21 minutes for the Lakers \u2014 all around his career averages. \n \nAgainst the Jazz, he recorded nine points and nine rebounds, while Zubac scored a career-high 16 points to go with 10 boards. Walton said that after Mozgov \u201cstruggled early\u201d against the Jazz he \u201cstuck with it and he was a big part\u201d of the Lakers\u2019 efforts to keep the score close early in the third period. \n \nBut he\u2019d understand if Mozgov is looking over his should at Zubac. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for him to at least be thinking about it a little bit,\u201d Walton said, adding that Mozgov played a big role in keeping the Lakers in the game against the Jazz early in the third quarter. \u201cWe\u2019ll encourage him to keep playing his game.\u201d \n They know how to win  \nWhile speaking to schoolchildren at a clinic hosted by Spectrum SportsNet on Saturday, former Lakers point guard Derek Fisher offered some advice that could apply as well to the current Lakers as to kids. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is just a winner because they woke up today,\u201d said Fisher, who joined Spectrum as a studio analyst this season. \u201cAnd so when you say winning is a skill, meaning that it\u2019s possible for anybody, a skill is something that if you work at it in the right ways and you invest the right amount of time \u2026 if you\u2019re willing to invest the time in something you can develop the skill to be good at it.\u201d \n \nAppearing with James Worthy at a clinic for students from Toland Way Elementary and Fletcher Drive Elementary, Fisher said it is important for members of the current team to be active in local communities \u201cso that during the tough times, the people in this city will still have your back if they feel like you\u2019re a part of it.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bill Oram"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Lakers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lakers notebook: Pneumonia could sideline Julius Randle","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90503","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Torrance","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Breeze","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676533","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"296"},"name":"Daily Breeze","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailybreeze.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199763616","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:47:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.dailybreeze.com/storyimage/LI/20170128/SPORTS/170129431/AR/0/AR-170129431.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11757","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lindenhurst","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lindenhurst Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"188655922","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Lindenhurst Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lindenhurst.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199769516","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Celebrities including \u201cSex and the City\u201d actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \u201cWhat Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I\u2019m here in protest,\u201d said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d he said in a statement. \u2014 NEWARK, NEW JERSEY More than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who\u2019d rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \u2014 FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA Dozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \u201cLove, Not Hate, Makes America Great\u201d and \u201cSay It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\u201d as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \u201call legal remedies\u201d available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \u2014 DENVER Dozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \u201cRefugees are welcome here.\u201d Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \u201cI come in peace.\u201d Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn\u2019t clear whether anyone has been detained under the president\u2019s executive order. \u2014 CHICAGO A crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O\u2019Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O\u2019Hare\u2019s international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. Lawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O\u2019Hare all released by late Saturday. Among those released before the federal judge\u2019s order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. Noorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O\u2019Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. The couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. After Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \u201cI can\u2019t believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\u201d \u2014 DALLAS Protesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump\u2019s executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \u201cSet them free!\u201d At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. Among those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son\u2019s petition. Bahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn\u2019t talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. Hundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d Immigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \u201cThey were like a machine when I talked to them today,\u201d he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. Hassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \u201cShe was about to cry,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\u201d Honarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \u201cTo have a better life and to make more money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, for the freedom.\u201d \u2014 SEATTLE About 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \u201cWe are America.\u201d Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women\u2019s March. \u201cIt\u2019s not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\u201d said Khalaf, 29. \u2014 PORTLAND, OREGON A protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\u201d and \u201cNo ban no wall America is for us all.\u201d \u2014 LOS ANGELES About 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport\u2019s Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. Avriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \u2014 SAN FRANCISCO Hundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport\u2019s international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \u2014 SAN DIEGO As motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \u201cNo hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hancock","zipCode":"45839","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Findlay","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Findlay Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169717988","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"221"},"name":"Findlay Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thecourier.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199776102","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://thecourier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hosted.ap_.orgphotos00e44751aa6294767aa8e757c7764c3b4_1-small-0124ebe1761e39f0ec1117fa502f025fd3b8eea6-150x98.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It will be another tough game for us. Anything can happen in the cups so we\u2019ve got to play our game on the day. \n \n\u201cJoycey was great for me. He gave me my chance in the Reserves and I respect him as a manager and I still keep in touch with him now. \n \n\u201cI think he will succeed at Wigan. I\u2019ve worked under him and I\u2019ve seen the coaching he did and the reserve-league titles he won here. He always communicated well with the lads. As soon as I went out on loan he was calling me and coming to watch me at games.

Roscommon topped their group on scoring difference, but some cause for concern was the manner in which they shipped three goals late on to allow Mayo sneak a one-point win last weekend.   \n \nThat said, Rossies manager Kevin McStay is taking the positives from this campaign, insisting that his side are heading in the right direction ahead of a tough Division 1 opener away to Tyrone. \n \nGalway are among the favourites to get promotion from tier two and with the emergence of Barry McHugh, Michael Day and Killian McDaid as attacking threats, the early season vibes are good.     \n \nO'Byrne Cup final  \n1400 Louth v Dublin, Drogheda \n \n\n \nIt's a first O'Byrne Cup decider for Louth since 2011, while Dublin are looking to regain the trophy they last captured in 2015. \n \nAfter the semi-final win over Meath, Louth boss was full of praise for his charges and believes they are in good shape ahead of a spring campaign in Division 3. \n \nSpeaking to RTÉ Sport, he said: \"We have played four games in 2017 and we have won all four of them, so winning is becoming a habit with the group. Ultimately, they\u2019re resilient, they\u2019re driven, they\u2019re trying to become as good as they can be. It\u2019s a pleasure working with them. \n \n\"Every fellow we have in the panel is striving [to get better] and it is just a great group to work with.\u201d \n \nDublin have been working with a developmental squad throughout and temporary boss Paul Clarke feels that seven or eight of the players may push for places in Jim Gavin's squad for the league. \n \nLooking ahead to Sunday's final, Clarke told RTÉ Sport: \"Another real competitive game will bring the group on, the team on and players on another bit. For a Louth team to beat Meath [in the semi-final], that\u2019s a great result for them, they\u2019ll be really delighted with that. \n \n\"We\u2019ll be underdogs going into it but it\u2019s a challenge that all those guys are looking forward to.\" \n \nMunster SHL final   \n1400  Limerick v Cork, Gaelic Grounds \n \n\n \nIn a repeat of their clash from two weeks ago, Limerick and Cork will battle it out in the Munster SHL decider. On 15 January, Cork had 21 points to spare over their opposition - Patrick Horgan and Shane Kingston bagged two goals each as the Rebels ran riot. \n \nIn other games, Kieran Kingston's side finished strongly to defeat both Waterford and Clare - ideal preparation then for the Leesiders before the competitive waters of the league's top flight. \n \nAfter their trimming a fortnight ago. Limerick recovered to beat Clare in a tight encounter and then had too much in hand for Kerry.         \n \nWalsh Cup semi-final \n1400 Wexford v Kilkenny, New Ross \n \n\n \nThis game will be a good test for Davy Fitzgerald's Wexford against the form team in this season's Walsh Cup. It's interesting that Fitzgerald has only used 18 players in the three January games to date. Not many from the recent Leinster U-21 winning sides are getting a look in so far. \n \nThe Cats have been keeping the scoreboard operator busy in accounting for DCU, Antrim and Westmeath. Things should be a little bit tougher for them in New Ross.   \n \nKehoe Cup Round 3  \n1400 Longford v Louth, Glennon Bros Pearse Park  \n1400 Wicklow v Trinity College, Greystones \n \nAll-Ireland club IFC semi-finals | \n1415 St Colmcilles (Meath) v Pomeroy (Tyrone), Athletic Grounds  \n1415 Westport (Mayo) v Kenmare (Kerry), Cusack Park, Ennis \n \nAll-Ireland club IHC semi-finals  \n1300 Carrickshock (Kilkenny) v Robert Emmetts (Britain), O'Moore Park  \n1415 Ahascragh-Fohenagh (Galway) v Lismore (Waterford), O'Connor Park \n \nAll-Ireland club JFC semi-finals  \n1230 Dunedin Connollys (Britain) v Rock (Tyrone), Athletic Grounds  \n1230 Louisburgh (Mayo) v Glenbeigh-Glencar (Kerry), Cusack Park, Ennis \n \nAll-Ireland club JHC semi-finals  \n1230 Calry-St Joseph's (Sligo) v Mayfield (Cork), O'Connor Park  \n1400 Mooncoin (Kilkenny) v Lamh Dhearg (Antrim), Trim, 2pm \n \nSATURDAY'S RESULTS \nDr McKenna Cup final \nTyrone 2-13 Derry 1-07 \n \nWalsh Cup semi-final \nGalway 4-37 IT Carlow 0-15  Pearse Stadium \n \nMunster SHL round 5 \nWaterford 4-21 Kerry 0-15, Fraher Field \n \nRTÉ COVERAGE \n1230 Live score updates on all of Sunday's games on www.rte.ie/gaa  \n1400 RTE Radio 1's Sunday Sport will have reporters on the day's key games.   \n\nSunday will see rain in all areas early on, with remaining frost over Ulster, clearing quickly.

The Department of Homeland Security issued an order Friday afternoon enforcing President Trump\u2019s executive order to \u201cclose down the borders to refugees and visa holders from a list of banned Muslim-majority countries.\u201d \n \nThe countries include Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. \n \nThe visa ban has caused problems for not only people traveling from these countries into the United States as well as some that were detained upon arrival. \n \nOne of those few was Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, an Iraqi man whose family is already living in the United States. The husband and father was granted a Follow to Join visa earlier this month on January 11th. The man\u2019s wife and son were granted refugee status because of the family\u2019s work and association with the United States military. \n \nAccording to a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of the man, Alshawi\u2019s wife worked for a U.S. contractor and now lives in Houston, Texas with the couple\u2019s son. \n \nAlshawi\u2019s wife from 2006-2007 as an accountant for U.S. contractor Falcon Security Group. In the lawsuit , \n  \n\u201cMr. Alshawi heard through neighbors in the family\u2019s community in Baghdad that, due to the family\u2019s association with the U.S. military, insurgents thought that they were collaborators.\u201d \n  \nAlso in the lawsuit, \n  \n\u201cIn 2010, insurgents attempted to kidnap Ms. Alshawi\u2019s brother. A month later, an IED placed on Mr. Alshawi\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s car detonated, killing her husband and severely injuring her and her daughter. Fearing for their safety, Mr. Alshawi and his wife moved from Baghdad to Erbil, Iraq.\u201d \n  \nAlshawi was immigrating to the United States through Stockholm and was in the air when the executive order went into effect at 4:30 p.m. His plane arrived at the JFK International airport at 8:22 p.m. on Friday. He was detained and is currently still at the JFK International airport. Those being detained have angered and protestors have gathered inside and outside of many airports all over the United States, including JFK.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Lisa Sanchez"},"topics":[],"title":"Trump's Immigration Ban Stops Iraqi Refugee From Coming To Texas","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KLAQ 95.5 FM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"505697018","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"KLAQ 95.5 FM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://klaq.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4167124/Director-Asghar-Farhadi-t-attend-Oscars-visa-ban.html","http://static.politico.com/14/2a/f36cb79143f09381f4c1acac7ab4/trump-lawsuit.pdf"],"sequenceId":"695199792814","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:59Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/klaq.com/files/2017/01/RS15691_526549428.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Our country is the most innovative in the world because of the diversity we\u2019ve come to embrace. Sadly, we\u2019ve appeared to have lost that as of late. I am upset to say we\u2019ve turned our backs on many of the qualities that make the United States such a tolerant, innovative country. \n\nThis is exemplified by President Donald J. Trump\u2019s latest executive action on refugees. Trump recently signed an executive order entitled \"Protection of The Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into The United States.\" This action stops refugees from predominantly Muslim countries coming to the United States for 120 days and suspends Syrian refugee indefinitely. Some of the countries that are banned, such as Iraq, are working with American troops to crush the so-called Islamic State. \n\nMr. Trump explained these executive orders were \"To ensure the sacrifices of our military are supported by the actions of our government.\" I am deeply offended a President who never served his country would strive to erode the values our country holds so precious by citing our veterans as a justification. This action only weakens our country\u2019s diversity at a time when innovation is needed more than ever. \n\nThis questionable policy shift amounts to failing those most in need, at a time of crisis. Since the war in Syria began, half a million people have been killed, and millions more displaced. The Syrian regime has employed chemical agents against thousands. \n\nWhile Islamic terrorism has received considerable publicity as of late, the danger from Muslim extremists on American soil is relatively insignificant. According to a University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill study, in 2016, out of around three million Muslims in the United States, merely 46 Muslim Americans attacks were related to terrorism at home or aboard. Furthermore, Muslim terrorism makes up only one-third of a percent of the killings in America. \n\nWhat killed most people you should ask? In 2016, over 11,000 American lives were lost because of gun violence not linked to terrorism. You hear nothing uttered about gun violence, do you? It is easy to let intolerance prey on our fears, but our priorities aren\u2019t on par with reality. \n\nMuslim terrorism should be a consideration, but not the top priority. Some have cited the Islamic State-inspired terrorist attacks across Europe as a reason to be worried. Unlike in Europe, the United States already vets refugees thoroughly before arrival. This is why Trump\u2019s refugee decision is so baffling. We already have extreme vetting in place, which is why less than 1% of refugees are resettled in the United States. \n\nFor those that support the refugee ban, I ask you to please think if the situation were reversed. What if your family was in limbo, starving, hoping for a better life? Trump\u2019s executive actions attempt to unweave the diverse fabric that makes our country great \u2013 something Mr. Trump so aspires us to be, again. \n\nMany look to America as a light of hope in a cruel world. Mr. Trump changed that with the stroke of a pen, turning his back on those who need us most.

I also thought more about the House, Senate, and White House being held by the same party. That doesn\u2019t happen often, and it can backfire for the party in power. There is a lot to \"brunch\" on this week:\n\n\"The Great Society\" \u2013 The 1960s became a dominant era for Democratic politics in the U.S. Republicans had controlled the House and Senate through 1954, but then lost both. When President John Kennedy was elected in 1960 and was succeeded by President Lyndon Johnson, the Democrats had a stranglehold on power in Washington. They passed significant legislation such as the Civil Right Act and Voting Rights Act, but also increased the nation\u2019s entanglement in the Vietnam War. Still, it was a long era of political dominance in this country and a lot got done, controversial as some of it was.\n\n\"Carter 1976\" \u2013 In 1976 after eight years of Republicans in the White House - and the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal - Democrats increased their majority in the House and Senate, and elected a President in Jimmy Carter (D-GA). It all went downhill from there. Carter never embraced \"insider\" Washington, and offended such power-brokers as House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill (D-MA), and Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). Intraparty fights ruled the day and the all-Democratic government produced few \u2013 if any \u2013 accomplishments. It was so bad that Carter lost in a landslide in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, and the GOP also swept control of the Senate.\n\n\"Clinton 1992\" \u2013 In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton defeated the incumbent George H.W. Bush and also brought solid majorities to the House and Senate. His signature initiative was health care reform, to be championed by First Lady Hillary Clinton. But many long-time Democrats in the House and Senate who had jurisdiction over health legislation, felt their toes were being stepped on. Congress is a series of kingdoms and fiefdoms where committee chairs and sub-committee chairs wield power and loyalty that the Clinton\u2019s never perceived. Not only was health care reform abandoned (it never even got a vote), but Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress in 1994, for the first time in 40 years.\n\n\"Bush 2000\" \u2013 After the divisive 2000 Presidential election, the U.S. Senate was split 50-50, but Republicans essentially held control with Vice President Dick Cheney as the tie-breaking vote. The GOP was able to pass \u2013 with significant Democratic support \u2013 the \"No Child Left Behind Act,\" education reform legislation. But in late May Senator Jim Jeffords (R-VT), left his party to become an independent - after the large Republican tax cut bill \u2013 and Democrats took control of the Senate. Normally that might cause legislative gridlock as the GOP held the House, but the September 11th attacks gave an impetus to national unity. Many Democrats wound up supporting a controversial war in Iraq, for example.\n\n\"Obama 2008\" \u2013 When Senator Barack Obama (D-IL), won the White House in 2008, his party had already taken control of the House and Senate two years prior. Although it took just over a year, Democrats finally had enough votes in both chambers to pass the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare. It was a triumphant and historic legislative act nearly forty years in the making. It shows what a unified party in complete control of the agenda, can do in Washington. Unfortunately for Democrats, the law was \u2013 and still is \u2013 highly controversial. It prompted the GOP takeover of the House in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and the White House in 2016. The ACA is now poised for repeal.\n\n\"Trump 2016\" \u2013 In many ways the Affordable Care Act created the \"perfect storm\" for the 2016 election. Republicans now control the White House, the Senate, and the House, with enough votes to undo what the Democrats created (without a single GOP vote), in 2010. That issue aside, there could be other issues that sharply divide the Republicans as we go forward. As we\u2019ve seen, unified government can be more of a blessing than a curse.\n\n\"Fair Weather Florida\" \u2013 While I was in Florida this past week, I was struck by how influential the Sunshine State is in creating the above mentioned scenarios. In 1980, the strong win by President Ronald Reagan helped bring a political unknown named Paula Hawkins (R-FL), into a new U.S. Senate majority for Republicans. In 2001, a close Presidential race in Florida, made the Republican U.S. Senate seat a wild-card. Democrat Bill Nelson (D-FL) won, leaving the U.S. Senate in a tie. In 2016, a sudden return to the Senate race by failed White House candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, (R-FL), helped save his party\u2019s Senate majority. Florida remains a big deal, for control of the White House and Congress.\n\n\"Why All of this Matters\" \u2013 Many people expect the Republicans to just steamroll legislation through Congress and onto President Trump\u2019s desk for his signature simply because the GOP holds all three seats at the table. But as we saw with President Carter in 1976 and President Clinton in 1992, intraparty fights can sink all of that. In fact, Bill Clinton was far more successful in the first three years after Republicans seized control of the House and Senate in 1994.

Usually, the most tricky topic for me to discuss regarding Nigeria\u2019s nationhood is religion and ethnicity. Difficult to discuss not because I\u2019m afraid of being verbally molested and splashed with mud, but because emotive issues hardly lend themselves to reason. Ethno-religious matters are so emotionally charged that reason is always the first casualty. When emotions trump reason, we can never reach a consensus on finding lasting solutions. Yet it is solutions, not emotions, that we need in these trying times. We badly need peace. You will say there cannot be peace without justice \u2014 and I will add that there cannot be justice without reason. \n -- \n  \nWhenever I read reports and comments on the southern Kaduna crisis, the first question I ask myself is: so what exactly is responsible for the latest round of killings? I am yet unable to put my finger on the justification for the carnage. I may here recall historical tensions between the Christian and Muslim communities in northern Nigeria. I may allow myself to speculate that these historical tensions habitually reach a tipping point with the slightest hint of friction. I am thus induced to think that the Kaduna carnage resulted more from age-long deep-seated mutual hate and animosity rather than recent events. It takes only a little spark to start another explosion. \n \nTo understand the context, I cannot doubt that the issue of framing is at play in the Kaduna crisis. It has been successfully framed in the media (not by the media) as a religious war. This is understandable. Southern Kaduna is predominantly Christian and the Fulani herders are Muslims. It is somewhat expected to be cast as Christians vs Muslims rather than Kaura, Sanga et al vs Fulani herders. This is the same way the Berom vs Fulani in Jos north was cast as Christians vs Muslims. It just so happens that people in the same local grouping are not unlikely to be of the same religion. Ethno-religious framing is thus inevitable, even if the core issues have nothing to do with religion. \n \nIndeed, in northern Nigeria, primary identities are constructed around religion. You are first a Muslim or a Christian before you are a northerner. Whenever there is a clash, therefore, the issue at hand does not really matter \u2014 Christians (including those from southern Nigeria) will automatically queue up behind Christians and Muslims behind Muslims. Compare and contrast with the south where conflicts are not framed around religion, insofar as religion is not the actual cause. If southern communities fight over economic issues, such as land and water resources, it is automatically treated with the template of communal clash. \n \nIn Ebonyi state, Ezza and Ezillo communities in Ishielu local government clash quite often over land. On a single day, December 31, 2011, to be specific, 66 persons were killed, including pregnant women, men and children. It was a communal clash since they are all Igbo Christians. Recently, 40 persons were killed in a communal clash between Ntan Obu-Ukpe in Cross River state and Ikpanya in Akwa Ibom state. Also recently, 10 persons died in a communal clash between Usumutong and Ediba in Cross River. But 800 people were killed in a religious war between southern Kaduna villages and Fulani herders. Religion catches more national attention, in any case. \n \nDown south, identities are, in the main, constructed around ethnicity but rarely religion. You are first a Yoruba, Igbo, etc before you are a southerner. When Mr Babatunde Fashola, as governor of Lagos state, \u201cdeported\u201d homeless Igbo to Onitsha in 2012, it was framed as Yoruba vs Igbo. It was not treated as a case of Muslims vs Christians even though Fashola is a Muslim and the \u201cdeported\u201d Igbo are Christians. (Let me quickly digress: northerners will complain about the number of federal appointments based on the number of northern Muslims on the list \u2014 whereas southerners will first look at the number of Igbo, Yoruba, etc, before other criteria.) \nIf Malam Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna state, were to \u201cdeport\u201d homeless Berom to Plateau state, it has to be Muslim vs Christian since el-Rufai is a Muslim and the Berom are Christians. Contrast with Mr Simon Lalong, governor of Plateau state, \u201cdeporting\u201d homeless Tiv to Benue state. \n \nSince Lalong is a Christian and the Tiv are mostly Christian, the \u201cdeportation\u201d will be framed differently. That is why even though bandits (most likely the same people operating in southern Kaduna) have for long been terrorising Zamfara communities, killing over 300 in the last one year, it is not framed as a religious war but banditry. After all, it is Muslims killing Muslims. \n \nWe may, at this point, return to the southern Kaduna carnage. What is basically a case of criminality has taken the colour of a religious war. Not unexpectedly, our religious fault line is being magnified one more time by agents of war. Identity, twinned with political preferences and limited economic opportunities, are not only mobilisable but highly combustible. Predictably, Christians are queuing up behind Christians and Muslims behind Muslims. The real issues of criminality and insecurity \u2014 which bedevil all Nigerians irrespective of tribe and tongue, region and religion \u2014 are hardly discussed. Most reactions start and stop with religion. \n \nI must think that in all our outpour of emotions, we need to address the root causes of this carnage. I have not set out to deny that there is a religious content to the crisis in Kaduna. Instead, I have sought to prove the source of the tensions, suggesting that religion is latent rather than pertinent. It gets even worse when political leaders and security agencies are thought to be looking the other way while these killings are being perpetrated. I am compelled to that I have not set out to further inflame passions. I am unable to compete, in this regard, with the clerics who are spitting fire and threatening brimstone rather than playing the role of the blessed peacemakers. \n \nIn these challenging times, what would Jesus do? What would Jesus preach? What would Jesus advocate? An eye for an eye? I understand the frustrations and the disappointment with government handling of the carnage, but under no circumstance must we advocate more violence as the solution. Our energies, I propose, should focus on how to end the bloodbath. We should seek to be problem solvers, not problem multipliers. We should demand that the government live up to its responsibility. Truth be told: in southern Kaduna, Nigeria failed its citizens. This led to reprisal and self-defence. When the state fails in its duty, anarchy is the consequence. \n \nThe primary reason there is a government is to prevent anarchy. The state exists principally for the purpose of security, law and order. Monetary policies and siren-propelled convoys are secondary. Every local government in Nigeria has at least one security attaché from the Department of State Services (DSS). The job of the attaché is to gather intelligence. Where were these security attachés before the Kaduna killings erupted? What intelligence did they gather? What reports did they file? When tension started building up, did they report it? If they did, what action did the authorities take? Do people pile up arms and start killing one another within one hour? \n \nIt would seem to me that the DSS and police are more interested in the politics of Rivers and Ekiti states than the security of lives and property of Nigerians. The energies they have devoted to playing politics could have been better utilised protecting the lives of defenceless Nigerians. I repeat: the Nigerian state has woefully failed its citizens. The blood of the people killed in southern Kaduna \u2014 whether Christians or Muslims \u2014 will continue to haunt the Nigerian authorities who failed to protect them in their hour of need. In civilised societies, heads of security agencies would have resigned by now for their ineptitude. But, remember, we\u2019re discussing Nigeria here. Sigh. \n AND FOUR OTHER THINGS  \nDEATH WISH \nWhy do some people wish President Muhammadu Buhari dead? Who are the people pushing the tasteless rumour that he is dead? Who are the jokers behind the rumour that northern governors met with former military leaders, Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar (when both men were, in fact, out of the country) and took a decision to force Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to resign and allow Senate President Bukola Saraki to take over? What do people benefit from concocting these senseless rumours? To create tension in the land? To further poison a polarised polity? To set Nigeria on fire? Insanity. \n \nBIG BOTHER \nWhy is Big Brother Naija being shot in South Africa? I don\u2019t know. I won\u2019t be surprised if the organisers calculated the cost of diesel (N260 per litre) before opting to take a rational decision. The federal government is so bothered it has ordered the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to investigate the affront. Next step: federal government will order the ministry of health to investigate why President Muhammadu Buhari went to the UK for medical check-up rather than use the Aso Rock clinic or National Hospital, and then order the ministry of tourism to investigate why the president is having his vacation in London rather than in Obudu or Yankari. Contradictions. \n \nINDIGENES VS SETTLERS \nNorthern governors met in Kaduna last week and lamented the national shame called indigene/settler dichotomy. They declared: \u201cEvery Nigerian could conveniently settle in any part of the country without suffering any form of discrimination.\u201d Good. Great. The governors should then use their good offices to effect a constitutional change. At a point in American history, George W Bush was governor of Texas and his brother, Jebb, was governor of Florida. Both were born by the same parents. Why then do Nigerian politicians admire and talk about America so much and then fail to emulate the best practices from their systems? Convenience. \n \nGENIUS TRUMP \nUS President Donald Trump seems determined to fulfil his campaign promise of building a wall to check Mexican migrants. He also curiously said Mexico would pay for the wall, which will cost an estimated $25 billion. Mexico says it will not pay, so Trump has come up with an ingenious idea: he will impose a 20% duty on Mexican imports to pay for the wall. In practical terms, a car import from Mexico that would normally sell for $100,000 would go up to $120,000, and the $20,000 \u201cgain\u201d would go into building the wall. Who will pay the difference in price? American consumers. Who then is actually paying for the wall?

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  \n \nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n \nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n \n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their convincing win at Wellington. \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NZ Sevens team happy to leave Wellington and lick their wounds","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nelson Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744542","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Nelson Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199801816","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the past 24 hours four times opened fire on the militia\u2019s positions in the self-proclaimed Lugansk People\u2019s Republic (LPR), the republic\u2019s defense authority told LuganskInformCenter on Sunday. \n \n\"From Krymskoye they shelled Frunze and Novogrigorovka, using IFV weapons, mortars and small arms,\" the agency quoted the authority. \n \nUnder fire were also Kalinovo and Kalinovka, the source added. \n \nOn December 21, 2016, the Contact Group seeking to find a solution to the Donbass crisis agreed to introduce a ceasefire in Donbass starting from midnight December 24. The current attempt to \"indefinitely\" cease the fire in Donbass has become the tenth since the conflict erupted in south-eastern Ukraine. \n \nThe Package of Measures to fulfil the September, 2014 Minsk agreements, known as Minsk-2, that was signed in Minsk on February 12, 2015, envisaged a ceasefire regime between Ukrainian government forces and people\u2019s militias in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Lugansk (DPR and LPR) starting from February 15, 2015, and a subsequent withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of engagement. The deal also laid out a roadmap for a lasting settlement in Ukraine, including local elections and constitutional reform to give more autonomy to the war-torn eastern regions. \n   \n{{item.group_date}} \n  \nShow more \n     \nTop News \n   \nJanuary 28, 23:44 \n \nPutin, Trump discuss anti-terrorism coordination, agree to keep in touch \n \nJanuary 28, 23:44 \n   \nJanuary 29, 7:27 \n \nRussia sends Il-76 plane to fight forest fires in Chile \n \nJanuary 29, 7:27 \n   \nJanuary 29, 8:07 \n \nTrump discusses security issues with five world leaders \n \nJanuary 29, 8:07 \n   \nJanuary 29, 7:05 \n \nUS lawmaker hopes anti-Russian sanctions to be reversed \n \nJanuary 29, 7:05 \n     \nIn other media","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Eastern Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ukraine news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Ukrainian military violate ceasefire in Lugansk Republic \u2014 news agency","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RU","country":"Russia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Tass.ru","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"550757895","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"77106"},"name":"Tass.ru","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://tass.ru"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://tass.com/politics/927812","http://tass.com/world/927840","http://tass.com/world/927843","http://tass.com/world/927839"],"sequenceId":"695199809176","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

whisky, and the US in bourbon Britain\u2019s prime minister is the first foreign leader to visit the new American president, Donald Trump. They have lots to discuss \u2013 international security, immigration, \"the special relationship\". There is also much talk of laying the ground for a US-UK trade deal.\n\nMuch of the talk of a trade deal, however, misses some of the fundamentals of what trade deals actually are and what they involve. They are agreements over the extent to which countries will agree the scale and scope of access to each other\u2019s markets. These may be reciprocal: \"We agree to trade in cars in both directions with a 10% tariff.\" Or they can be quotas, limiting the quantity or value of certain goods that can be traded. Alternatively they can be multi-faceted: \"We agree to have no restrictions on you exporting gin to us if we can export bourbon to you on the same terms.\" They are not, as most politicians seem to think: \"We agree to buy £100m worth of stuff from you if you buy £100m worth of stuff from us.\"\n\nSo why does the UK need these deals at all? It could simply have free trade with everyone \u2013 . In practice, this would mean offering other countries free access to its markets and hoping that they would reciprocate. Countries would only agree to this where they think it is in their interests \u2013 where they assume they will sell more to us than we will to them.\n\nIn this situation, comparative advantage dominates. This means that production (all those manufacturing jobs) gravitates to the location with the lowest costs. This is often politically unacceptable, as governments generally look to protect jobs and tax revenues, as well as to protect activities that fund innovation.\n\nThe difficult bit\n\nThis is why there is so much talk of trade deals going on. But the difficult part of a trade deal is not the negotiation itself; it\u2019s figuring out which industries will gain or lose from a given deal, and what the overall outcome will be, given the knock-on effect for various sectors of the economy. Equally, they must take into account how businesses will respond to a given agreement and what lobbying they will they do in advance.\n\nNegotiators are essentially like barristers that put forward arguments based on the analysis that they are given.\n\nA closer look at how the much vaunted UK-US \"trade deal\" would work shows what\u2019s really involved. In order to ascertain whether this will be \"good\" for the UK, you have to start with an understanding of what the nature of comparative advantage is between the UK and US \u2013 what is the UK better at than the US, and what is the US better at than the UK. Then you have to work out how this relates to goods and services that each wishes to trade.\n\nFor example, one could argue that the UK has comparative advantage in whisky, and the US in bourbon. But just because the imported products become cheaper after a reduction in tariffs, does that mean that the UK will actually import more bourbon and, if so, might that actually be bad for the Scotch whisky industry? Then it\u2019s necessary to work out the overall effect on each economy \u2013 by combining the comparative advantage for all sectors (from agriculture to pharmaceuticals), and work out if the deal is a good one.\n\nA lack of experts\n\nThe UK used to have \"sector experts\" who knew everything about their sector to figure this out. But it hasn\u2019t needed them for 25 years, as the EU has performed this role on the UK\u2019s behalf. As a result, the civil service has neither the capacity or the skills to fill this gap. Equally, many private sector firms had economics departments \u2013 Unilever, British American Tobacco, Ford among them \u2013 whose job it was to figure out what would happen to their sector if certain tariffs were agreed (or not). But neither the private nor public sectors have had those skills for a generation because they have not been needed.\n\nThe large professional service firms are circling to do the job \u2013 at £2,000 per person per day \u2013 but they are generalists. They don\u2019t know any more whether we will import statins and export heart pills under a given deal with the US any more than the editor of the Daily Mail or the prime minister.\n\nWithout an in-depth analysis of relative production costs, spillovers between sectors and the multiplier effects associated with sectors expanding or contracting, this is all simply conjecture \u2013 which is essentially what has been happening since this debate over Brexit started.

Inspiring thoughts and famous quotes of Mahatma Gandhi can now be read on the entrances of Rajghat, with the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) giving the memorial site a facelift. Thirty famous quotes of Mahatma Gandhi have been inscribed on four entrance gates of Rajghat. In a project being undertaken by CPWD in association with Delhi Urban Arts Commission(DUAC) and Rajghat Samadhi Samiti, the security set-up of the memorial is also being revamped. The quotes have been inscribed on the granite gates using white marble. \u201cThe gates also have signatures of Bapu and his famous spectacle,\u201d a senior DUAC official told PTI. \u201cMahatma Gandhi\u2019s memorable quotes were selected by Rajghat Samadhi Samiti members to be put up at the entrances. At least six messages have been be displayed at each place for visitors to read as they enter the Rajghat,\u201d he added.\n\nThere are also plans to construct a guesthouse and install a solar power system and LED lights at the memorial complex. \u201cCPWD wanted to revamp the iconic memorial, which had electrical poles and wires placed in a hazardous manner. A big focus of the revamp has been on (improving) the security set-up.\n\n\u201c27 CCTV cameras have been installed at Rajghat, however, they do do not cover the entire complex, but only the central areas,\u201d the official said. The DUAC had last year approved CPWD\u2019s plans to give the memorial a facelift, after officials of both the organisations paid several visits to Rajghat. The work on the approved plan had begun in September last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Rajghat gets a facelift: Bapu quotes can be read on entrances","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199815124","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/rajghat-480.jpg?w=450"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/rajghat-480.jpg?w=480"}],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Police were called to attend following reports of a man touching women on the number 12 bus in the Dulwich area.\n\nA 22-year woman was travelling home when the suspect deliberately sat next to her, despite there being many free seats on the bus.\n\nThe suspect asked her whether she was alright and engaged her in further small talk. As she got up to leave, he sexually assaulted her.\n\nThe woman then moved to a different part of the bus and witnessed the man approach another victim, a 17-year-old girl, who confronted him. The incidents were reported to the bus driver, and the man alighted in Barry Road, Dulwich.\n\nThree days later on Friday, January 27, a different 17-year-old girl boarded a 176 bus at around 15:15hrs. A short time later, the same suspect boarded the bus and sat opposite her. After trying to speak to her, he intentionally fell onto the victim and touched her inappropriately.\n\nLater on that day at around 17:00hrs, a 13-year-old girl reported that she was sexually assaulted whilst travelling on a 363 bus. A second 13-year-old also subsequently reported a man of the same description trying to engage her in conversation on the 197 bus near Dulwich Library, SE22, which made her feel uncomfortable.\n\nAt around 17:50hrs, a-15-year-old girl boarded a 171 bus at Catford Train station. The suspect, coming from another part of the bus, sat opposite from her and started to touch her knee. Feeling frightened, she got off the bus nearly Bromley Road, SE6. The man followed her and tried to engage her in conversation before groping her. The victim then ran off.\n\nPolice are treating these incidents as linked and want to public\u2019s help to trace the suspect. He is described as a black male, aged in his twenties, with short black hair and facial stubble. He was wearing a black bomber jacket with a white fur trim on the hood and blue baggy jeans.\n\nDC Alex Price from the Met\u2019s Road and Transport Policing Command said: \u201cWe are keen to trace the suspect carrying out these despicable attacks on young girls and women in public. Five victims have been targeted by this man and we believe there could be many more victims who are yet to come forward.\u201d\n\nMembers of the public are advised not to approach the male if spotted but to call 999. To give information about the man pictured please call 101. To remain anonymous contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\n\nYou can also tweet the police via @MetCC.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Appeal following sexual assaults on Lewisham and Southwark buses","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Foreign Affairs.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"546393502","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"79"},"name":"Foreign Affairs.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://foreignaffairs.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199833196","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:49Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  \n \nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n \nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n \n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their convincing win at Wellington. \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NZ Sevens team happy to leave Wellington and lick their wounds","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Taranaki Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Taranaki Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199834989","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Martin stars as therapist David in CBC\u2019s dramatic comedy Michael: Every Day, now in its second season after a five-year hiatus. (Season 1, dubbed Michael: Tuesdays and Thursdays, wrapped up in December 2011.) \n \nDavid\u2019s patient Michael (Matt Watts) is back working with him and the two are continuing to build on their symbiotic relationship. The final two episodes in the six-part run air Sunday night. Martin spoke about the show, his own phobias and working with old friends. \n \nQ What\u2019s your own personal biggest neurosis? \n \nA I have a severe elevator phobia. It\u2019s a huge, huge problem for me. I spend half the year in New York, so it\u2019s almost impossible for me to escape elevators \n \nQ What is it about elevators? \n \nA It\u2019s not about dying in them, it\u2019s not about the crashing, or the cords breaking. It\u2019s just simply about being in a box and not being able to do anything. It\u2019s a control thing. But I deal with it. I kind of do the immersion therapy approach: I just get in the elevator, but it\u2019s extremely unpleasant. \n \nThe nice thing is I work in musical theatre, and David Foster is a very successful composer who cannot get in elevators at all. So every time I ask to take the stairs, they always bring up David Foster. So I feel like I\u2019m in good company. \n \nMatt Watts, left, and Bob Martin in Michael: Every Day [CBC] \n  \nQ You\u2019re the co-creator, executive producer, writer and star \u2014 do you enjoy being responsible for everything? \n \nA I do. I\u2019m very much a control freak. There\u2019s a lot of me in that character, for sure. In fact, I would say that David is all the worst parts of me. I would love to be a psychologist, so it\u2019s great for me to live vicariously through that character, to enact all my worst possible scenarios in life through that character. \n \nIn order to do that, I have to write it too. Although, Matt (Watts) wrote two episodes and Lynn Coady wrote two episodes. I was kind of the head writer, and Don (McKellar) and Matt and I conceived the whole series, so it\u2019s a very collective effort. \n \nQ You\u2019re working with a lot of same people \u2014 it must\u2019ve been pretty seamless, getting back together for Season 2. \n \nA Don and I have a long creative history. We went to high school together, and we worked on things all our lives together. The musical that brought me to New York \u2014 The Drowsy Chaperone \u2014 Don and I wrote that together as well. He really took a lot of the load this season because of my crazy schedule. \n \nAnd Matt and I are like brothers \u2014 we\u2019ve also known each other since I was in my 20s. This series, it\u2019s inspired by all Matt\u2019s craziness. When CBC approached me to develop a series, I was friends with one of the producers and I was talking about something Matt had told me. We both thought it would be a great idea for a series, and what he was describing was really the first episode of Season 1 \u2014 an exercise he did with his therapist to deal with his issues with small talk. \n \nJennifer Irwin is an old friend of mine who I worked with at Second City, and she plays Sammy in the series, and Tommie-Amber Pirie (Claire) is a close friend. So for sure, it\u2019s a group of people who are used to working together and are comfortable with each other. \n \n\nFonte: canada.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Telly With Melly: Bob Martin of Michael: Every Day talks own phobias","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"IT","country":"Italy"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Easy News Press Agency","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"561956767","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Easy News Press Agency","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.easynewsweb.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://o.canada.com/entertainment/television/telly-with-melly-bob-martin-of-michael-every-day-talks-own-phobias/"],"sequenceId":"695199836137","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If we get 1 on 1, I'm going your way, so you'd better win,' \" Webb said. \"And he did. He won multiple times.\"\n\nWebb spread the ball around to other receivers, like Mississippi State's Fred Ross, as well. The Pac-12 Conference's leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb.\n\nNate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in a showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina's Zay Jones with 1:51 left, but the North went for two points and a potential lead.\n\nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga's Keionta Davis, Peterman's pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU's Harvey Langi. The South ran out the clock from there.\n\nThe week was more about auditioning for NFL teams than winning, but Peterman said he wanted that last completion \"very bad.\"\n\n\"You're always competitive,\" said Peterman, who was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and played most of the game. \"To say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool. We didn't get it, but it was a great experience still.\"\n\nWebb was the game's overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech.\n\nHe led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 \u2014 on a third-and-10 play \u2014 and 13 yards before the touchdown.\n\nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South's attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. Toledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays.\n\n\"Honestly, the guys up front did a great job, and I just showed some patience and was able to hit it,\" Hunt said. \"It opened up. It was pretty clear reads up there. Everybody was going hard. We wanted to win.\"\n\nThe South's honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. The South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. That included a pair of interceptions thrown by Antonio Pipkin of Division II Tiffin and another by Tennessee's Josh Dobbs. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Zenor The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Webb, Reynolds have strong connection in Senior Bowl win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"35601","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Decatur","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Decatur Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169682898","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"39"},"name":"Decatur Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.decaturdaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199840992","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/decaturdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/4f/34f1d903-c926-5a8f-b34a-6589c17bf91b/588d41654131b.image.jpg?resize=300%2C236"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/decaturdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/4f/34f1d903-c926-5a8f-b34a-6589c17bf91b/588d41654131b.image.jpg?resize=512%2C402"}],"video":[]}}

In 2017, the city is working with local partners to take action, and I urge our community to join us by supporting the Chattanooga 2.0 movement and sharing your story at chatt2.org. \n \nWe are not only talking the talk, but walking the walk. \n \nMike Sarvis \n \nIllegal votes? Why, investigate! \n \nI keep hearing that President Donald Trump and his followers constantly refer to the 2.5 to 3.5 million \"illegal votes\" in the election. Is it possible that these are the votes that won the election for him? \n \nPerhaps he should appoint a blue-ribbon committee to investigate discrepancies. Maybe the results would be different this time. \n \nStanley R. Smith \n \nNo guarantee to insurance access \n \nIt is time to correct a misconception. There is a very big difference between obtaining health insurance and attaining health care. \n \nObamacare merely promised affordable health insurance \u2014 not health care. After rate increases, outrageous deductibles, failing exchanges, insurance company withdrawals, and medical provider refusals, this ill-conceived legislation proved a failure. \n \nWhile the Obama administration could claim that more people had health insurance under this legislation, they could not demonstrate that access to health care was improved as a result. \n \nOur founding documents define rights as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Health care is not on that list. Health care is important to our society. Health insurance can be an important vehicle to gain access to health care. But it must be affordable and acceptable to the medical community. Give the free market a chance to achieve this end. \n \nMike Budnick \n \nWinchester, Tenn. \n \nNo-shows should lose their jobs \n \nTo all voters: Any U.S. senator or congressman who refused to attend President Trump's Inaugural address should be removed from office. \n \nIf this doesn't happen, the next time they run for office, they should be voted out. They don't deserve to represent our country or you. \n \nHarry Arnold \n \nTrump 'fact check' needed \n \nGiven the mendacity of our new president, I would like to suggest that the Times Free Press set up a Trump Fact Check box on its front page, every single day. This would be a valuable public service. \n \nSo far, during the transition, as well as his first few days in office, he and his teammates have issued lie after lie about nearly every topic they have addressed. \n \nThese include his apparent belief that there were millions of votes by illegal immigrants, despite no documented evidence, to well-documented evidence about the size of the turnout to the inauguration. \n \nIt's amusing to see his press secretary twist himself in knots trying to defend all of this. \n \nBrian Hamilton \n \n'Never Trump' labels no issue \n \nTo Hillary Clinton, I am deplorable. To [TFP cartoonist] Clay Bennett, I am a \"sucker.\" \n \nWho I really am is an American citizen concerned with the worsening direction of our country. During the presidential campaign, President Obama stated that his name was not on the ballot, but his policies were. \n \nThat statement, plus the status quo of the Washington establishment, made me realize that a nonpolitician-outsider was needed to affect real change for the better in Washington. \n \nI believed God was sending America that needed change agent in the person of Donald J. Trump. \n \nI pray President Trump succeeds in restoring greatness and world respect to our country. I will then proudly wear any label or name that Clay Bennett or any other \"never-Trumper\" may call me. \n \nRobert Reno \n \nOoltewah \n \nRadical protesters here to stay \n \nI wonder if anyone else saw the irony in a recent letter to the editor when the writer boasted \"whether they like it or not, they (meaning the thousands of ignorant and radical protesters) are going to get to watch eight years of economic growth, a reformed immigration system, a clamp down on immoral behavior . \" \n \nClamp down on immoral behavior? When we have probably the most ethically and morally bankrupt president in history? \n \nI was one of those thousands of \"ignorant and radical protesters.\" Trust me, we aren't ignorant, but I will give you radical if that means exercising our right to free speech and peaceful assembly. We had to watch and listen to crowds of barking Trump supporters for 17 months. \n \nIt's your turn. Get used it. We're not going away. \n \nRebecca Rochat \n \nSen. Alexander should listen up \n \nSen. Lamar Alexander's constituents have spoken, and he isn't listening. As a parent of two school-age children, I care deeply about the state of education in our nation. \n \nI listened to the entire confirmation hearing of Betsy DeVos. She has never been a school administrator, an educator or a parent of a public school student. Her voucher/charter program in Detroit has had dismal results. Her responses prove she is unqualified to run the U.S. Department of Education. \n \nIn a recent Facebook post, Alexander blamed opposition to DeVos on partisan politics. This is unfair and untrue. Seven hours after he posted, there were more than 2,500 comments to his post, from both sides of the aisle. While I didn't read them all, almost every one I read opposed DeVos. \n \nWe need thoughtful leadership from someone who knows and values public school education and the federal laws that govern our educational system. \n \nThe only one playing partisan politics is Alexander. He needs to listen, and answer, to the people who elected him to the office he holds, not the president. \n \nSara Wood","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Film festival offers 'priceless' film experiences at bargain price and more letters to the editors","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hamilton","zipCode":"37403","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chattanooga","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Chattanooga Times Free Press","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169665183","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2609"},"name":"Chattanooga Times Free Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesfreepress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199845444","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

So it\u2019s a different animal.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge is trying to determine if a quarterback\u2019s skills \u2014 which are usually highlighted within the college game\u2019s spread offenses \u2014 can translate to pro-style systems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a different game. Even if you look at the (Senior Bowl) practice field, there\u2019s three sets of hashes \u2014 high school, college and professional \u2014 so that creates a different type of football game,\u201d Chicago Bears head coach John Fox, whose staff is coaching the North Team, said Tuesday. \u201cFrom the quarterbacks and the systems, we had to spend 20 minutes last night working on the quarterback (being) under the center to be able to snap the ball. So that part\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nBut the challenges run deeper than snapping, a fact made evident by the varying amount of progress made within the most recent quarterback class.\n\nOf the 15 quarterbacks drafted last year, only four attempted more than 85 passes in the NFL this past season \u2014 Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Jared Goff, Philadelphia\u2019s Carson Wentz, Cleveland\u2019s Cody Kessler and Dallas\u2019 Prescott.\n\nPrescott was the surprise of this year\u2019s class after being drafted in the fourth round, leading all rookies with 23 touchdowns to just four interceptions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like Tom Brady being a sixth-round pick,\u201d Fox said Tuesday. \u201cIf (the Patriots) knew he was going to be Tom Brady, they might not have waited until the sixth round, and it\u2019s the same thing for Dak.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Goff and Wentz \u2014 the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks \u2014 had completely different rookie seasons, with Wentz starting from Week 1 and finishing with a rookie-best 3,782 yards. Goff started the final seven games but never looked comfortable, throwing seven interceptions to five touchdowns while completing just 54.6 percent of his passes.\n\n\u201cI think we put so much pressure on it, we promote those guys \u2014 you pump up Jared Goff, you bump up Carson Wentz \u2014 because you need one,\u201d former Green Bay Packers assistant director of personnel Marc Lillibridge said Wednesday. \u201cYou know, if you want to have success, you\u2019ve got to find a guy.\u201d\n\nIn 2012 four quarterbacks were taken in the first round, but only No. 1 overall pick Andrew Luck and No. 8 pick Ryan Tannehill are consistent starters.\n\nWashington\u2019s Kirk Cousins \u2014 a fourth-round pick \u2014 led all fifth-year quarterbacks with 4,917 passing yards this season, while Wilson, a third-round pick, led the Seahawks to their fifth straight postseason appearance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, you get mesmerized by certain (attributes), you put a guy in a box and you think he\u2019s got to be this to win for us, but he doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Lillibridge, a former NFL scout and agent who now works in the private sector. \u201cThat\u2019s why Seattle\u2019s doing so well because they took a chance on a guy in Russell Wilson who doesn\u2019t check a lot of boxes, and neither does Drew Brees.\n\n\u201cBut they have some kind of moxy, something that works for them. And it\u2019s tough \u2014 trust me, I\u2019ve done a lot of quarterback reports, and I\u2019ve missed on more than I\u2019ve hit.\u201d\n\nBut the one thing that separates the top quarterbacks from the rest is the ability to maintain poise and maneuver within the pocket, especially when faced against the speed of NFL defenses.\n\n\u201cPass rush gives quarterbacks a lot of issues in the NFL. You\u2019re seeing it with Jared Goff \u2026 that\u2019s the toughest thing for quarterbacks,\u201d said CBSSports.com senior NFL Draft analyst Dane Brugler. \u201cThe best in the NFL do it really well \u2014 Aaron Rodgers, obviously, Tom Brady, those guys do a great job of dealing with pressure and delivering downfield, and that\u2019s something a lot of college quarterbacks don\u2019t have to do.\u201d\n\nWhether a player like Dobbs, who started for the South in Saturday\u2019s Senior Bowl and finished with 104 total yards and an interception on 12-of-15 passing, has what it takes to handle that is yet to be seen.\n\nBut as the 10th ranked quarterback in this year\u2019s draft class \u2014 according to CBSSports.com\u2019s positional rankings \u2014 and a third-day option, Dobbs won\u2019t face the same pressure to contribute early as expected first-round options such as Clemson\u2019s Deshaun Watson, North Carolina\u2019s Mitch Trubinsky or Notre Dame\u2019s DeShone Kizer.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s in a guy\u2019s heart, you don\u2019t know how he reads defenses,\u201d Lillibridge said. \u201cYou try to put them through every scenario you possibly can. \u2026 But a lot of times you don\u2019t know the competitive spirit in a guy\u2019s head.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Alex Byington"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Evaluating QBs an inexact science","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"35601","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Decatur","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Decatur Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169682898","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"39"},"name":"Decatur Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.decaturdaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://CBSSports.com/"],"sequenceId":"695199855158","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/decaturdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/16/216cadc3-619b-53c8-aae4-b6603628c594/588d44ad648dd.image.jpg?crop=492%2C312%2C7%2C9&amp;resize=492%2C312&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/decaturdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/16/216cadc3-619b-53c8-aae4-b6603628c594/588d44ad648dd.image.jpg?crop=492%2C312%2C7%2C9&resize=300%2C190&order=crop%2Cresize"}],"video":[]}}

It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\u201d The tweet featured American and Israeli flag icons. \n \n\n \nTrump\u2019s executive order last week to start building the wall \u2013 fulfilling one of his campaign promises \u2013 has already stirred controversy, leading to a diplomatic crisis with Mexico. Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico\u2019s president, canceled a planned meeting with Trump subsequent to the order. \n \nDefending the order last week, Trump cited Israel\u2019s experience. \u201cA wall protects,\u201d Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News on Thursday. \u201cAll you have to do is ask Israel. They were having a total disaster coming across and they had a wall. It\u2019s 99.9 percent stoppage.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s White House account on Saturday afternoon retweeted Netanyahu\u2019s tweet. \n \nA number of things remain unclear about Trump\u2019s interview, and Netanyahu\u2019s subsequent affirmation. Trump did not specify whether he was referring to the barrier Israel erected in the 2000s in the West Bank, or to the one lining the Israel-Egypt border. And it\u2019s not clear what Netanyahu was saying was \u201cright\u201d: Trump\u2019s proposal for the wall with Mexico, or merely Trump\u2019s apparent assessment that Israel\u2019s barrier with Egypt is a success. \n \nIsrael\u2019s foreign ministry \u2013 also nominally helmed by Netanyahu \u2013 subsequently sought to suggest that Netanyahu was not pronouncing on the Mexico wall per se. \n \n\u201c.?@IsraeliPM referred to our specific security experience which we are willing to share,\u201d Emmanuel Nahshon, the foreign ministry spokesman, said in a tweet. \u201cWe do not express a position on US- Mexico relations.\u201d \n \n\n \nNetanyahu\u2019s intervention could anger Democrats, already wary of the prime minister because of his years of tensions with former President Barack Obama. \n \n\u201cThis is very troubling to hear from the Israeli Prime Minister,\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said in a tweet, flagging ?@AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is endeavoring to smooth ties with Democrats, and especially the Hispanics and blacks among them. \n \n\n \nDaniel Shapiro, who weeks ago just completed a term as the U.S. ambassador to Israel, expressed bafflement at Netanyahu weighing in on the issue. \n \n\n \n\u201cPM @netanyahu\u2019s top aides told me a key goal in Trump\u2019s era was keeping bipartisan support for Israel. Now this?\u201d Shapiro said in a sequence of tweets. \u201cIsrael\u2019s challenges with Sinai border not similar to US border. Their solution (a fence, not a wall) works for them, would not for us.\u201d \n \nAmong the groups objecting to Trump\u2019s proposed wall are major Jewish civil rights groups, including the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League. \n \n\u201cConstruction of a new border wall, even should Congress approve funding for such a costly project, may not be the most efficient way of assuring border security,\u201d the AJC said in statement Thursday. \n \n\u201cIn fact, it may adversely affect the existing robust and extensive economic and other ties between the U.S. and Mexico,\u201d the statement said. \u201cU.S. and Mexican law-enforcement authorities have a productive record of jointly fighting organized crime, drug trafficking, and violence through exchange of information and intelligence. The two countries have redoubled their cooperation on the border, establishing a bi-national security communications network that includes coordinated patrols between the Mexican Federal Police and the U.S. Border Patrol.\u201d \n \nThe ADL has not yet pronounced on the specifics of Trump\u2019s order to build the wall, but is on the record opposing the idea. A wall would \u201cbe impractical and very likely ineffective,\u201d it says in an entry on its immigration facts page, and counsels \u201ca process for addressing immigration that treats immigrants with dignity and respect instead of as criminals.\u201d \n \nIsrael\u2019s barrier with Egypt is a fence completed in 2013 aimed at keeping out migrants from Africa, and also to be part of a security system protecting Israel from increased militant Islamic activity on the Egyptian side of the border. The length of the Israel-Egypt border is about 165 miles. The length of the Mexico-U.S. border is just shy of 2,000 miles. \n \nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Central America news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Netanyahu Praises Trump's Mexican Border Wall Plan","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"IL","country":"Israel"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Virtual Jerusalem","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169725877","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"71"},"name":"Virtual Jerusalem","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.virtualjerusalem.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.jta.org/"],"sequenceId":"695199855543","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

better won\u2019t be good enough. \n \nThe Bank of England governor, overseeing an economy recording solid expansion and accelerating inflation, will probably raise near term projections for both this week, according to economists. At the same time, he may highlight potential longer-term threats from Brexit that may damp any speculation about tighter policy. \n \nIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act for Carney, who spent much of 2016 fending off accusations he was being far too gloomy about the economy. While inflation will breach the BOE\u2019s 2 percent target within months, the Monetary Policy Committee has indicated it\u2019s keeping its emphasis on supporting growth for now, a trade-off that may become more challenging if the economy keeps up its current momentum. \n \n\u201cOn the face of it, the inflation forecast and the fairly resilient growth performance argues for a more hawkish message,\u201d said Sam Hill, an economist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cBut given the headwinds that are approaching related to Brexit, it\u2019s likely the MPC will spend some time making clear just how much room they\u2019ve got to look through a period of inflation being above target.\u201d \n \nEconomists predict the BOE will keep its key interest rate at a record-low 0.25 percent and leave the size of its quantitative-easing program unchanged on Feb. 2. In August, officials announced a 60 billion-pound ($75 billion) expansion of their gilt-purchase plan, a round of bond buying that is set to expire in February. \n \nFed, BOJ \n \nSince their last forecasts in November, the pound has stopped falling and the economy has maintained its 0.6 percent pace of quarterly expansion. Another bright spot may be a stronger global backdrop. The Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan also announce policy decisions next week. \n \nAll but two out of 19 economists in the Bloomberg survey see the MPC raising its growth forecast for this year, while the majority see the panel also raising its inflation projection. However, most see the bank leaving its estimates for next year unchanged. \n \nThree months ago, Carney said the bank\u2019s next rate move could be up or down. U.K. consumer-price growth rate jumped to 1.6 percent in December, and some economists see it reaching as much as 3 percent this year, well above target. That\u2019s prompted traders to raise bets on an interest-rate increase this year. \n \nYet concern that Brexit will hurt trade is expected to hit business investment, and faster inflation means consumer spending will probably slow. U.K. companies from BT Group Plc to Whitbread Plc have warned about the outlook, while U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the specter of trade wars. Economists don\u2019t see the MPC changing tack any time soon, with Bloomberg surveys showing no policy change until at least 2019. \n \n\u201cThe messaging we get may well be taken as hawkish,\u201d said Liz Martins, U.K. economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. \u201cHowever, we are not persuaded that the MPC is yet in hawkish mode.\u201d \n \nThe meeting will be the last for Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking Minouche Shafik before she leaves to become director of the London School of Economics. The Treasury has yet to announce her replacement. \n \n--With assistance from Harumi Ichikura \n \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Scott Hamilton in London at shamilton8@bloomberg.net. \n \nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Gordon at pgordon6@bloomberg.net, Brian Swint, Fergal O'Brien \n \n©2017 Bloomberg L.P.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Bank of England news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Central banks news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Better Forecasts Not Enough for Carney in Brexit's Long Shadow","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"IT","country":"Italy"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"La Repubblica","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660147","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"La Repubblica","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.repubblica.it/","publisher":"Editoriale La Repubblica Spa"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199856242","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

One side that belongs to the defunct URP led by National Hospital Insurance Fund Chairman Muhamud Ali, Saku MP Ali Rasso (URP) is fighting to gain hold on JP to ward off entrance of ODM leaders led by Governor Ukur Yattani. The URP side had lost all seats except that of Saku and ODM's Raila Odinga polled 54 per cent of the presidential votes in the last elections.\n\nNow on Mr Ali's side is Senator Abubakar Harugura (ODM), who was a key ally of Yattani in 2013, while the governor is backed by MPs Joseph Lekuton (Laisamis, ODM), Chachu Ganya (North Horr, ODM) and Roba Duba (Moyale, UDF). President Uhuru Kenyatta who visited Marsabit town on Thursday and met local elders, appealed to the leaders to unite and asked residents to vote for him and JP candidates in the August 8 polls. However, sources from both sides that attended a closed-door meeting with the President, said the leaders argued openly on which side could deliver more votes . Addressing residents near Shell Petrol Station, Uhuru did not allow any leader to speak. He, however, dwelt on local politics and cautioned the leaders against inciting residents to violence.\n\n''You have had relative peace since the last time you had problems (2013-2014 Moyale clashes) and I commend leaders for preaching peace',' said the President. The Head of State asked residents not to be misused by politicians who incite them against each other, adding that Marsabit is home to Borana, Rendille, Gabra and Burji among other tribes.\n\nNoting that majority of residents voted for the Opposition (ODM) in the 2013 polls, the President urged them to vote for him and JP candidates in the August elections. At the same venue where the President held his rally, Harugura said he decided to join Ali's team claiming the governor and his allies had misused county funds. ALSO ''I was in his (governor) team during the 2013 election and worked with him for about a year and a half until I lost confidence in him. I want this new team to take over the county's leadership,'' said the senator. ''For example, the county has an annual emergency budget of Sh200 million. We have severe drought and nobody knows what they have done with close to Sh1 billion from the kitty up to now,'' he said.\n\nA source close to JP headquarters revealed that both sides would be invited to Nairobi for a joint meeting to agree on sharing positions to thwart fallouts that would benefit the Opposition. But the two camps ruled out sharing of positions, adding that they may opt to join affiliate JP parties or even move to the Opposition.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ali Abdi"},"topics":[],"title":"Jubilee's headache to unite URP and ODM 'defectors'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"KE","country":"Kenya"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"East African Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660745","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"916"},"name":"East African Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke","publisher":"The Standard Group Ltd."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199873554","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/jubilees_headache_t588d9d900dcda.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Its full significance has now become apparent.\n\nThe find contained a mixture of extremely rare Anglo-Saxon coins and Viking silver, which provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex and his less well-known contemporary Ceolwulf II of Mercia.\n\nSome of the coins were minted with a 'Two Emperors' design, borrowed from the Romans, which shows that the currency was used in both ancient kingdoms.\n\n© Sky News Screen Grab Coins point to some sort of an alliance in the 870s between Alfred and Ceolwulf. \"This is an extraordinary find, one which re-writes Anglo-Saxon history,\" Xa Sturgis, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which now houses the coins, told Sky News.\n\n\"The keeper of the coin room here came running up the stairs to tell me. The more they were excavated the more it became obvious how significant they are. These coins point to some sort of an alliance in the 870s between Alfred and Ceolwulf.\"\n\nWhile Alfred is often described as the king who founded England, uniting Mercia and Wessex, very little is known of his rival Ceolwulf.\n\n\"These coins prove that there was a very real alliance between the two men at that time,\" added Julian Baker, coin curator at the Ashmolean.\n\n\"That alliance hasn't survived in the historical record until now. Alfred manipulated history to put himself in a better light. To date, history has overemphasised Alfred's record and almost completely neglected Ceolwulf.\n\n\"We can start re-writing that decade now, courtesy of the Watlington hoard.\"\n\n© Sky News Screen Grab Watlington in Oxfordshire where a hoard of Anglo Saxon coins were found The Ashmolean has until Monday, 31 January, to raise £1.35m to keep the coins and Viking silver in Oxfordshire and they are extremely close to that figure now.\n\nMore than 500 people in the local area have donated to the fund set up to raise the cash.\n\nMr Sturgis added: \"Alfred is the only king in the history of England described as 'great'. But these coins show that in the 870s he needed Ceolwulf. It's incredible that we know so little about him and Alfred dominates everything. It's like he obliterated Ceolwulf.\"\n\nThe Watlington Hoard, as it is now known, is on public display at the Ashmolean as historians begin the process of re-assessing that period of Anglo-Saxon history.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Saddleworth Moor victim was 'a lonely character"},"topics":[{"name":"UK news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"UK coins discovery 'will re-write' Anglo-Saxon history","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MSN UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588902","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.uk.msn.com","publisher":"Microsoft Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199876748","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She has won 10 major titles since turning 30 and has made eight out of the last grand slam 10 finals. \n\nWilliams believes she is in the form of her life. \n\n\"I was thinking yesterday on the practice court, 'gosh I'm playing better than I have ever before I think',\" Williams said.\n\n\"I'm moving better, I've always been a fast mover but I stopped moving a bit in the middle of my career because I was like, I don't have to move so much.\n\n\"But I was like, 'man I'm hitting really well'. It feels good to be playing this well at the moment.\"\n\nBy her own high standards, 2016 represented a disappointing season for Williams.\n\nThe American only added a Wimbledon title to her tally and also surrendered the world number one spot to Angelique Kerber after a shock US Open defeat to Karolina Pliskova.\n\n\"Winning this one was very important,\" Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou said.\n\n\"I feel when you end the season with a loss, especially in a grand slam, you cannot feel the same way and cannot have a good feeling.\n\n\"She had confidence but not the same kind as when you win. That's why this one was very important for the rest of the season.\"\n\nWilliams has struggled at times with the weight of expectation, crumbling at the 2015 US Open when a calendar grand slam was in sight and then stumbling again there in September when on the brink of breaking Graf's record.\n\nShe has appeared far more relaxed in Melbourne, on and off court, with her new fiance Alexis Ohanian here supporting from her box throughout.\n\n\"I've been trying to live it for some time now, this tournament I was able to do it,\" Williams said.\n\n\"I was okay with not losing but I also knew I didn't have to win here to make my career. It settled with me this time. I don't know why I felt like that but I want to know because I want it again.\"\n\nSurpassing Graf's 22 major triumphs adds statistical weight to the now almost indisputable argument that Williams is the greatest female player of all time.\n\nShe could pass Court's mark at Wimbledon this summer, although 13 of the Australian's 24 successes came before the Open era, when grand slams were still not fully professional.\n\n\"Graf's record is more important because with all the respect for Margaret Court, it's another era,\" Mouratoglou said.\n\n\"The draws were like 16 players, they were not professionals. Of course the record is there and we definitely want to beat it but there is a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\n\n\"Serena was not motivated by 22, she was motivated by grand slams. That's her motivation.\n\n\"This won't change until one day she wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams but for now she is, so that's enough.\n\n\"Is that day close? I don't think so. I am not in her head but I don't think so.\"\n\nWilliams did take some motivation from reclaiming her place at the top of the world rankings, which she will when the list refreshes on Monday.\n\nTo avoid adding any extra pressure, however, Mouratoglou told his charge at the start of the tournament that victory would not return her to number one.\n\n\"In the beginning of the tournament, I was like, 'if I win, will I be number one?'\" Williams said.\n\n\"Patrick said, 'no, no, no.' So I was like whatever. Then on the court when they were said, 'and number one', I was like, 'whoa, really'?\" \n\nWilliams later added: \"Kerber played unbelievable, she definitely deserved to have that position. I t didn't hurt or p*** me off, to me it just looked weird. I'd never felt like number two.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams: I'm in the best form of my life after 23rd grand slam","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Lancashire","zipCode":"LA1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lancaster & Morecambe Citizen","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670272","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Lancaster & Morecambe Citizen","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thelancasterandmorecambecitizen.co.uk","publisher":"Newsquest Media Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199899810","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thelancasterandmorecambecitizen.co.uk/resources/images/5939734/"}],"video":[]}}

He and his teammates couldn't overcome their dreadful start despite the effort they delivered in the final 26 minutes. \n \nThe Leopards clawed as close as one point in the second half, forcing Loyola University Maryland coach G.G. Smith to call a timeout with 10 minutes, 1 second to play. The Greyhounds steadied themselves with a 10-0 spurt and held on for a 70-62 win in a Patriot League men's basketball game Saturday afternoon at Kirby Sports Center. \n \n\"We knew they were going to come out and just really pressure us,\" Lafayette coach Fran O'Hanlon said. \"I thought we did a terrific job after the first 10 minutes of just starting to defend and playing with some energy that we needed. \n \n\"You expend so much energy trying to get back into that game. At the end, they made the plays when we had cut it. You've got to give them credit. We had some momentum.\" \n \nLafayette (6-15 overall, 2-8 Patriot League) looked like it might get blown off its home floor for a third straight game early. The Leopards trailed by 10 points just over 5 minutes into the game. They were down 37-9 when Cam Gregory dropped in a layup with 6:30 to play in the opening half. \n  \nLindner led Lafayette's rally. He scored a team-high 21 points and handed out seven assists while playing all 40 minutes. Eighteen of his points and all his assists came in the final 26:30. \n \n\"To be honest, I think we started to play a little bit angry,\" Lindner said. \"We're on our home floor, and we go down that fast that much, it was a little bit embarrassing. I think every single one of us just dug down and played harder because that's just not how we want to go out in any game. \n \n\"I think our team showed great resiliency and some maturity for a young team.\" \n  \nLoyola Maryland's top three players made sure it wouldn't squander its huge lead. Jarred Jones, Gregory and Andre Walker combined for all 10 points during the 10-0 run the Greyhounds' produced after Lafayette closed within 48-47. Lafayette never got closer than two possessions again. \n \nGregory led Loyola Maryland (11-10, 5-5) with 21 points and 14 rebounds. His size and strength inside helped the Greyhounds amass a 42-20 edge in points in the paint. \n \nJones added 18 points, going over 1,000 for his career. Walker, a 6-0 junior, scuffled through a 1-for-13 day from the field but grabbed seven rebounds. \n \nMatt Klinewski scored 10 points and had five rebounds to join Lindner in double figures for Lafayette. Parkland High School graduate Kyle Stout chipped in with eight points and four boards. \n \nLafayette couldn't produce enough offense to avoid a seventh straight loss since its 2-1 start to Patriot League play. The Leopards' schedule grows tougher when the calendar flips to February. Five of their final eight Patriot League games come on the road, including trips to Boston University and Bucknell. \n \n\"You come out of this game wanting to win the next one, just hungrier to win the next one, because it doesn't get easier in this league,\" Lindner said. \"The balance in this league is unbelievable, so if we can string together a winning streak, you never know where we could end up.\" \n \nsamiller@mcall.com \n \nTwitter @mcall_smiller \n \n610-82","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Stephen Miller"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lafayette men's basketball team can't complete rally in loss to Loyola Maryland","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Baltimore City","zipCode":"21202","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Baltimore","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Baltimore Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663044","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Baltimore Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.baltimoresun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199902246","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:44:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d4f71/turbine/mc-loyola-lafayette-mens-basketball-20170128/600"}],"video":[]}}

(NYSE MKT: GST) ('Gastar' or the 'Company') today announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a Net Operating Loss (NOL) Shareholder Rights Agreement (the 'Rights Plan') designed to preserve its substantial tax assets. As of December 31, 2015, Gastar had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $512.0 million, which can be utilized in certain circumstances to offset future U.S. taxable income. The Company further expects its cumulative net operating loss carryforwards to increase as of December 31, 2016. As of January 18, 2017, Gastar's previously adopted rights plan expired pursuant to the terms of the rights plan. After considering, among other matters, the estimated value of the Company's tax benefits, the potential for diminution upon an ownership change, and the risk of an ownership change occurring, including the recently disclosed accumulations of Gastar stock, the Board adopted the Rights Plan, which is intended to protect Gastar's tax benefits and to allow all of Gastar's stockholders to realize the long-term value of their investment in Gastar. Gastar's ability to use these tax benefits would be substantially limited if it were to experience an 'ownership change' as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. An ownership change would occur if stockholders that own (or are deemed to own) at least five percent or more of Gastar's outstanding common stock increased their cumulative ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. The Rights Plan reduces the likelihood that changes in Gastar's investor base would limit Gastar's future use of its tax benefits, which would significantly impair the value of the benefits to all stockholders. The Company believes that no ownership change as defined in Section 382 has occurred as of the date of this press release. To implement the Rights Plan, the Gastar Board of Directors declared a non-taxable dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of its common stock. The rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires 4.95% or more of Gastar common stock. The rights will also be exercisable if a person or group that already owns 4.95% or more of Gastar common stock acquires additional shares (other than as a result of a dividend or a stock split). Gastar's existing stockholders that beneficially own in excess of 4.95% of the common stock will be 'grandfathered in' at their current ownership level. If the rights become exercisable, all holders of rights, other than the person or group triggering the rights, will be entitled to purchase Gastar common stock at a 50% discount. Rights held by the person or group triggering the rights will become void and will not be exercisable. The rights are not taxable to Gastar stockholders. The rights will trade with Gastar's common stock and will expire on the first day after the Company's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, unless the Gastar stockholders ratify the Rights Plan at such meeting, in which case the term of the Rights Plan is extended to three years. The Gastar Board may terminate the Rights Plan or redeem the rights prior to the time the rights are triggered. Additional information with respect to the Rights Plan will be contained in a Current Report on Form 8-K that Gastar will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stay is national,\u201d ACLU Voting Rights Project Director, Dale Ho, said on Twitter. \n \nCrowds outside the Federal Court in Brooklyn, New York, cheered the news. \n \nThe ACLU said the judge ordered a list of detainees to be provided, and said it would go through the names and ensure they are released. \n \n\u201cBut the critical point tonight is no one can be sent back to one of these countries,\u201d Lee Gelernt, Deputy Director of the ACLU Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said. \n \nThe order, signed by Trump on Friday, puts in place a 120-day hold on entry of refugees to the U.S., and indefinitely suspends the admission of Syrian refugees until the president is satisfied that changes have been made. \n \nIt also suspends entry for 90 days from certain countries based on statute related to the Visa Waiver Programme. \n \nThe most recent version of that programme lists Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as countries to be affected by the President\u2019s order. \n \nTrump said the order was necessary to keep foreign terrorists out of the U.S. \n \nThe president had during his campaig and after taking office called for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of some people entering the country. \n \nThe order has drawn many criticisms since Friday, prompting widespread protests especially in New York. \n \nProtests erupted in several airports across the U.S. on Saturday over the executive order, which turned into celebrations after the stay was granted. \n \nDemonstrators at a terminal at John F. Kennedy, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d \n \nThe ACLU had filed a lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were detained after arriving at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport following the order. \n \nThey were later released, and a senior Trump administration official said waivers would be granted. \n \nThe ACLU then said it was seeking \u201ca national stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in U.S. airports under the programme. \n \nAnthony Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU, said Trump\u2019s order would have caused people with valid visas and green cards to be turned back to Iraq, Iran and other countries. \n \nHe said the group believes around 200 people will be directly affected by Saturday\u2019s stay. \n \n\u201cClearly this is just the first day of what will be a very long battle,\u201d Romero said. \n \nHe said the onus was now on the Trump administration to prove the executive order is constitutional.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Top Africa stories","group":"Top stories"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Refugee Order: Judge stops Trump,","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Vanguard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662043","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"57240"},"name":"Vanguard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.vanguardngr.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199918824","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

By 9 p.m., estimates placed the crowd at over 1,000, and they were able to shut down some operations at the airport. \n More than 1,000 people are still at Seattle-Tacoma airport.

The Seattle Times reported that local resident Ibado Ahmed was at the airport to pick up her husband, who was coming to Seattle from Somalia. He was turned away and sent back to Germany, where his flight had originated from. \n\nPort of Seattle commissioners released a joint statement on Saturday expressing disapproval of Trump's order. The commissioners say the order was abrupt, and didn't leave room for preparation. \n\n\"As the operators of this airport, we are deeply concerned that the abrupt nature of the executive order did not allow adequate process for public agencies such as ourselves to provide service that travelers and families expect and deserve,\" the statement read. \"We took it upon ourselves to request a full briefing from Customs and Border Protection to understand how they are addressing this situation.  We respect these hard working federal employees who are under tremendous strain.  However, when we felt that traveler needs were not fully met, the Port of Seattle stepped up.  We started providing private waiting areas for families here at the airport and connecting families to lawyers who can help advocate for their rights and the rights of their loved ones.\" \n\n \nEarlier on Saturday, there was outrage that some Sound Transit light rail trains were skipping the Sea-Tac stop.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \nReleased under special circumstances \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n'The executive order is unlawful' \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq.

Merr. are used in the Garo, Pahan, and Teli tribal communities of Bangladesh as a traditional medicinal plant to treat hepatitis, diabetes, ulcers, heart disease, and dysentery. However, there have been limited phytochemical and biological studies on the bark of L. coromandelica . This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant activities of L. coromandelica bark extract (LCBE) and the underlying mechanism using RAW 264.7 cells. The LCBE was analysed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect its key polyphenolic compounds. Various in vitro antioxidant assays were performed using RAW 264.7 cells to assess the antioxidant effects of the LCBE and to understand the underlying molecular mechanism. HPLC revealed the presence of gallic acid, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, catechin, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in the LCBE. The extract showed a very potent capacity to scavenge numerous free radicals through hydrogen atom transfer and/or electron donation and also quenched cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation without showing any toxicity. The LCBE was found to combat the oxidative stress by enhancing the expression, at both transcriptional and translational levels, of primary antioxidant enzymes as well as phase II detoxifying enzymes, especially heme oxygenase 1, through the upregulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated pathway in RAW 264.7 cells via the phosphorylation of p38 kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The LCBE exhibited strong antioxidant activities and mitigated the cellular ROS production. These results provide scientific evidence of its potential as an ideal applicant for a cost-effective, readily available, and natural phytochemical, as well as a strategy for preventing diseases associated with oxidative stress and attenuating disease progress.

The coordinates are 39 degrees 13.406 minutes north and 106 degrees 0.108 minutes west.\n\nHalfway up Fairplay's Front Street stands a curious monument made of dull gray cement adorned with ore samples from many of the mines in the Fairplay-Alma area. \n\nEtched in the cement is the following expression of respect to one particular burro called Prunes. \n\nIt reads, \"Prunes \u2014 a burro \u2014 1867 \u2014 1930. Fairplay, Alma \u2014 All Mines In This District.\" Expressed in this simple inscription is the heartfelt praise to this shaggy little servant of Colorado. \n\nRipley in his \"Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not\" syndicated cartoon made Prunes and his monument famous. Prunes was featured in 1943 on the radio version of \"Death Valley Days.\"\n\nThe last mine where Prunes worked was at the Hock Hocking mine in Mosquito Gulch. \n\nPrunes became the miners' pet, shuffling back and forth with ore cars in the dark, damp passages. Superintendent Harry Radford maintained that Prunes was his top jackass. \n\nWhen Prunes became too old, his owner Rupe Sherwood freed the jack from its collar and traces. He set it free to roam in the sunlight at will.\n\nAfter Sherwood \"pensioned\" his faithful jack, the animal spent its final years making the rounds of Alma's back doors begging for food.Residents eagerly gave the old jack food. Flapjacks fried in sowbelly grease made old Prunes hee-haw with delight. As the animal approached his 60s, his health began to fail. An examination of his mouth revealed that Prunes was losing his teeth along with his ability to eat.\n\nA blizzard struck Alma in 1930, and the snow drifted deep. The temperature plunged below zero, and Prunes took refuge in an old shed. During the blizzard, the door blew shut, and a snowdrift prevented the old burro from pushing the door open. \n\nThis relief is a tribute to Prunes, a burro that was said to have worked all of the mines in the Fairplay-Alma area. (Kenneth Jessen / For the Reporter-Herald) Residents noticed that the burro was not making his usual rounds. After searching, they found Prunes half starved in the shed, weak in the legs and unable to walk. He was showered with food and affection, but he did not recover from his exposure to the blizzard.\n\nThe miners met in May 1930 in Alma to decide what to do about the suffering animal. It was a difficult decision, and the miners elected to put an end to the suffering of their little long-eared friend. Prunes was shot as some of the old-timers, including Sherwood, wept. His little gray carcass was discarded in a local garbage dump.\n\nA Fairplay cafe owner, with the help of other willing admirers, dug a grave on Fairplay's main street, and here they deposited the remains of Prunes. \n\nOver the grave, the miners in the area erected the unique cement monument studded with ore samples from the mines Prunes had worked. Never before had an animal been so honored by a Colorado mining town.\n\nA year later on Aug. 23, 1931, at the age of 82, Rupe Sherwood died in the Fairplay hospital. \n\nOn his deathbed, he realized he was on his last trail and asked to be cremated. He requested that his ashes buried behind the monument under which the bones of his faithful burro were buried. The funeral was attended by about 500 people. A bronze plaque was added to the top of the monument.\n\nKenneth Jessen has been a Loveland resident since 1965. He is an author of 20 books and more than 1,600 articles. He served on several Loveland boards and was an engineer for Hewlett-Packard for 33 years.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: relationships news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Burro Named Prunes buried on street in Fairplay","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Larimer","zipCode":"80537","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Loveland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Loveland Herald Reporter","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169696686","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"143"},"name":"Loveland Herald Reporter","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.reporterherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199949276","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2017/0126/20170126__29rhkjw~1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Tawdheef recruitment exhibition presents the perfect opportunity to meet with these talented professionals and communicate the importance of building the industrial sector, one of the fundamental pillars of the UAE economy\", said Mona Fekri. \"With the recruitment and training of new and young talent, we look forward to coming alongside the wise leadership of the UAE Government in achieving the vision of a diverse and integrated economy led by the industrial and manufacturing sectors and built on innovation and creativity.\" \n \nThe UAE industrial sector, which contributed 14 percent to GDP, is forecast to expand and contribute 20 percent in 2021. The UAE seeks to attract more than US$70 billion in industrial investments by 2025, which will help increase the share of the industrial sector in the country's GDP to 25 percent in the same year. \n \nDucab aims to strengthen the participation of Emirati youth in the industrial sector by equipping them with the required professional expertise through its vocational training and scholarship programmes. The company has a robust Emiratisation programme in place that has led to the successful recruitment and retention of talented UAE nationals. \n \nTawdheef 2017 is taking place at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre from the 30th January to 1st of February. \n \nWAM/Moran","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Ducab participates in Tawdheef 2017 with opportunities for Emiratis","source":{"category":"Corporate","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"EmiratesNewsWire.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608060506","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"EmiratesNewsWire.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://emiratesnewswire.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199949674","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(Reuters)  \nPresident Donald Trump today directed US military to develop a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d within 30 days to defeat the ISIS, asserting that America must take decisive action against the dreaded terror group. \u201cThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, is not the only threat from radical Islamic terrorism that the US faces, but it is among the most vicious and aggressive. It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a \u2018caliphate\u2019. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\u201d Trump said in his executive order. \n \n\u201cFor those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\u201d he said. \n \nThe plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group. Trump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. \n \n\u201cIf ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability. It continues to radicalise our own citizens, and its attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount. The US must take decisive action to defeat ISIS,\u201d Trump said. \n \nThe terror group is responsible for the violent murder of American citizens in the Middle East, including the beheading of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig, as well as the death of Kayla Mueller, the executive order notes, the executive order said. \n \nIn addition, ISIS has inspired attacks in the United States, including the December 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, and the June 2016 attack in Orlando, Florida, it said. \n \nYou may also like to watch this \n \n\u201cISIS is complicit in a number of terrorist attacks on our allies in which Americans have been wounded or killed, such as the November 2015 attack in Paris, France, the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, the July 2016 attack in Nice, France, and the December 2016 attack in Berlin, Germany,\u201d said the executive order. \n \nThe plan seeks public diplomacy, information operations, and cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimise ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology; identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and policies to empower coalition partners to fight ISIS and its affiliates; and mechanisms to cut off or seize ISIS\u2019s financial support, including financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources. \n \nPlease Wait while comments are loading...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"US President Donald Trump gives US military 30 days to prepare anti-ISIS strategy","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Financial Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659519","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"110"},"name":"Financial Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.financialexpress.com","publisher":"The Indian Express Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199951110","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:49:50Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/01/Donald-trump-reu-s-300x167.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A Glasgow-based vet left stranded in Costa Rica following US president Donald Trump's immigration crackdown is now on her way back to Scotland. Hamaseh Tayari, who holds an Iranian passport, was due to fly back to the city via New York on Saturday following a holiday in the Central American country.\n\nShe was prevented from doing so by the executive order signed by Mr Trump that imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the US for nationals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nMs Tayari, who grew up in Italy, is a postgraduate veterinary student at the University of Glasgow.\n\nA spokesman for the university said: \"We were extremely concerned at the difficulties which one of our postgraduate students encountered on trying to return to the UK via the United States after holidaying in Costa Rica.\n\n\"We have been in touch with Hamaseh who is now on her way back to Glasgow via an alternative route. The University will do all that we can to support her.\"\n\nIt is hoped that she will be able to return to Scotland on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier Ms Tayari told the Guardian newspaper: \"This has really shocked me. We just discovered (what Trump did) at the airport when we went to check in. \n\n\"I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees. I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.\n\n\"I am destroyed. I did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible? I am really afraid about what is going on.\"\n\nMr Trump's order barred all refugees from entering the US for four months, and indefinitely halted any from Syria. He said the ban was needed to keep out ''radical Islamic terrorists''.\n\nThe move immediately suspended a programme that last year resettled in the US about 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice.\n\nDowning Street said on Sunday morning that Prime Minister Theresa May does \"not agree\" with Mr Trump's refugee ban and would make representations if it affected Britons.\n\nScottish politicians have taken to Twitter to express their views on the issue.\n\nScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: \"Back from Copeland to read the news of the US ban on migrants from Muslim countries. Both wrong in itself and very worrying for the future.\"\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"Scotland & US have deep friendship built on values. We must all speak up for those values - tolerance, equality & refuge for those in need.\"\n\nResponding to Ms May's statement she added: \"The PM should have said this the first time she was asked, not hours later and only under pressure.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"UK immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"UK news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Scotland news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Vet stranded by Trump immigration clampdown on way back to Scotland","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"City of London","zipCode":"EC1A","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Islington","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"BT.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"378943354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"132"},"name":"BT.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://home.bt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199954072","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://home.bt.com/images/vet-stranded-by-trump-immigration-clampdown-on-way-back-to-scotland-136414264630510401-170129074002.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Anything else, including competing for the UFC, is on the backburner. McGregor hosted a Q&A pay-per-view in England to discuss what his future looks like and made no bones about it that he\u2019s chasing after a boxing match with Mayweather. \n\nIt all started when the UFC lightweight champion took to Instagram moments before the question-and-answer session began to make a statement that resonated throughout the combat sports world. \n\n\u201cHeading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight,\u201d McGregor posted and then followed with dynamite series of f-bomb expletives aimed at just about everyone, including the promotion he\u2019s currently a world champion in. \u201c[Expletive] the UFC. [Expletive] Floyd. [Expletive] boxing. [Expletive] the WWE. [Expletive] Hollywood. And [expletive] you too pay me.\u201d \n\nAfter setting off the verbal bomb, McGregor\u2019s verbal assault did not let up during his session hosted by Ariel Helwani. The bombastic Irishman stated that he believes his next fight will most certainly be against Mayweather inside of a boxing ring. \n\n\u201cOne-hundred percent,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI believe the next time I step into a combat arena will be through the ropes wearing 10-ounce or eight-ounce gloves. I believe so.\u201d \n\nThe fight is still considered a pipe dream to most because of the enormous amount of red tape surrounding it. One of the primary sticking points has been the purse. Mayweather has demanded $100 million while McGregor has done the same. However, Mayweather stated that he would only offer McGregor $15 million, along with the back-end of the pay-per-view buys. Meanwhile, Dana White fired back and stated that he\u2019d offer both fighters $25 million a piece and discuss PPV options. \n\nObviously, the sides appear to be far from close to finding a level playing field. But McGregor is confident that a deal can be struck and said that negotiations have been ongoing. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Mayweather Promotions, there\u2019s the UFC, and now the newly formed McGregor Promotions, and we\u2019re all in the mix,\u201d McGregor said, before refuting that he has to answer to anyone. \u201cNobody is my boss. I know Floyd likes to say Dana [White] is my boss and this and he decides. Hell no. Nobody decides this. If they let people go fight jiu-jitsu tournaments, they can\u2019t stop me going to fight a boxing fight. So obviously it\u2019s smoother to do it all together, but look, everyone\u2019s just got to know their place, and everyone does know their place.\u201d \n\nMcGregor does believe that a fight with Mayweather will be the first \u201cbillion-dollar\u201d fight in combat sports and obviously would like to command more than a $15M-$25M purse. For the record, when it comes to the A-side, McGregor believes that would be him while Mayweather is the \u201cscared side.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the scared side, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to have a real fight. He needs rules to protect him. I don\u2019t need rules. So he can say he\u2019s this and he\u2019s that, but in reality, he\u2019s scared [expletive]-less. If I decide to just fight him straight-up \u2013 look, [expletive] the UFC, [expletive] MMA, [expletive] boxing, [expletive] sports fighting. Let\u2019s just say we fight. It\u2019d be the easiest fight ever.\u201d \n\nNevertheless, if the fight were to come to fruition, it would be a boxing match. The Irishman knows he\u2019d enter the fight as a massive underdog but that has given him immense motivation for the fight. \n\n\u201cThe sound of laughter and the sound of doubt motivates me so I\u2019m enjoying that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that going to fight any of these other UFC bums right now. They need to rise up. Right now, they\u2019re down there. I\u2019ve got this situation where people are truly doubting me, like they doubted me at the very, very beginning, and that\u2019s motivating for me.\u201d \n\nAs for his future in the UFC, with plans to fight Mayweather in late 2017 or early 2018, it means that we may not see the UFC lightweight champ in the Octagon for another year. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, for $100 million, I\u2019ll sit for another year,\u201d McGregor said. \n\n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Yahoo Magazines PYC"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: MMA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"McGregor: UFC on hold until Mayweather fight (Yahoo Sports)","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!Xtra","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657675","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yahoo!Xtra","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nz.sports.yahoo.com","publisher":"Yahoo!"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199955662","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:49:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://l.yimg.com/iu/api/res/1.2/_izXprv6P4xSYo1wqB0hJQ--/YXBwaWQ9c2hhcmVkO2NoPTc1Njtjcj0xO2N3PTc1NjtkeD0zMjQ7ZHk9MDtmaT11bGNyb3A7aD0xMzA7cT0xMDA7dz0xMzA-/https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/Qqu4ZgsS5INw9pYx92S9SQ--~C/Zmk9Zml0O3c9MTQwNDtoPTc1NjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7O2FwcGlkPXByb2Rlc2sy/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d21422238e48863d4190a436b12184e5"}],"video":[]}}

As per clause 1(a) Supply is said to include certain transactions like sale, transfer, barter, etc. made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business.

Meaning of \u201c Supply\u201d The amount of goods produced or available at the given price. \"Black's Law Dictionary\u201d. Make (something needed or wanted) available to someone. \u201cOxford Dictionary\u201d. To make (something) available to be used. \u201cMedical Dictionary\u201d. The term \u2018supply\u2019 has been defined in an inclusive manner (like definition of \u2018manufacture\u2019 in excise).The Supreme court in west Bengal state warehousing corporation Vs indrapuri studio Pvt. Ltd. has examined the meaning of inclusive and exhaustive definition as appearing in various statues. The word \u201cinclude\u201d when used, enlarge the meaning of expression defined so as to comprehend not only such things as they signify according to their natural import but also those things which the clause declared that they shall includes. Sydney High Court define the meaning of Supply In case of QUANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED VS COMMISIONER OF TAXATION The tribunal held that there has been a supply of right, obligation and services under the contract between QUANTAS and the passengers, for which the unused fares were consideration as defined, and that the assessment were not shown to be excessive. On the appeal by Qantas, the Full Court of the Federal Court held that \u201cthat the relevant supply in the present case is the contemplated flight ,not reservation\u2026and the contemplated flight failed to occur\u201d, that the tribunal had \u201cartificially split the transaction, and in consequence that there had been no taxable supply where the flight was not taken; \u201cit is plain that what each customer pays for is carriage by air. This is the essence, and sole purpose, of the transaction\u2026.. The actual travel was the relevant supply, and if did not occur there was no taxable supply.\u201d Supply of Goods Vs Service Title as well as possession both have to be transferred for a transaction to be considered as a supply of goods. In case title is not transferred, the transaction would be treated as supply of service in terms of Schedule II (1).  9. Composite Supply Section 2(27) \u201cComposite supply\u201d means a supply made by a taxable person to a recipient comprising two or more supplies of goods or services, or any combination thereof, which are naturally bundled and supplied in conjunction with each other in the ordinary course of business, one of which is a principal supply; Section 2(78) \u201cPrincipal supply\u201d means the supply of goods or services which constitutes the predominant element of a composite supply and to which any other supply forming part of that composite supply is ancillary and does not constitute, for the recipient an aim in itself, but a means for better enjoyment of the principal supply; Example: Indian Airlines provides passenger transportation service. They also supply food on board to passengers. Supply of transportation services would be the principal supply and the service as a whole would qualify as composite supply.  10. Mixed Supply Section 2(66) \u201cMixed supply\u201d means two or more individual supplies of goods or services, or any combination thereof, made in conjunction with each other by a taxable person for a single price where such supply does not constitute a composite supply Examples: Supply of soap bars where soap boxes are given free of cost; supply of wheat for which a bottle of honey is given free of cost. In the above example of honey being supplied with wheat, both wheat and honey will be taxed at the rate of tax applicable for honey (being commodity taxed at higher rate).  11. Goods Section 2(49) \u201cGoods\u201d means every kind of movable property other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before supply or under a contract of supply; Note: Electricity- Electricity is out of ambit of GST.  12.

Explanation: Excludes money and securities Includes transactions in money relating to use of money/ conversion by cash/ any other mode from one form to another for which a separate consideration is charged Author comment : Transaction in immovable property shall be outside from the ambit of GST.  13.

Author comments: The definition of business has been borrowed from sales tax Act. 1. History behind expended definition of business. In the state of Gujarat V. Raipur Mfg Co. Ltd. AIR 1967 SC 1066.It was held that normally, to constitute a business there should be volume,frequency,continuity and regularity in transaction of sale. Transaction must be enter with profit motive, though profit need not be in fact earned. In this case it was held that when a person carry on business is required to sale of fixed assets and discarded goods then he is not constitute business because he does not carry on business of selling of fixed assets. To override this decision and cover more transaction in tax net definition of business is expended . a. Profit motive is immaterial. b. The definition is very wise as even a single transaction may get covered under the ambit of \u2018business\u2019. c. If the main activity is constitute business then ancillary and incidental activity also cover in ambit of business. 2.IF THE MAIN ACTIVITY IS NOT BUSINESS THEN ANCILLARY AND INCIDENTAL ACTIVITY CAN NOT AMOUNT TO BUSINESS. In case of SRI Velur Devasthanam VS state of TN (MAD HC) held that dominant activity of assessee is religious and charitable in nature and not business and assessee cannot be treated as dealer in respect of sale of gold bullion offered by the devotee. In case of Ruhelkhand Education charitable trust VS CCT (UP Tri) held that it was settled that main activity of institution is to impart education and is not the business therefore incidental activity supply of food would not come within the meaning of word business. In case of CTO Vs Banasthali Vidyapith (2015) RAJ HC held that Education is not business\u2019. 3.Further, Explanation specifically provides that Any activity or transaction undertaken by the Central Government, a State Government or any local authority in which they are engaged as public authorities shall be deemed to be business. It is pertinent to note that Schedule IV provides list of activities by Central, State Government and Local Authorities as neither goods nor services. Once activity or transaction undertaken by Govt is cover in the definition of business then it should necessary to exclude something (Schedule IV) which Govt do not want to tax under GST.  15. In the course or furtherance of business; No definition or test as to whether the activity is in the course or furtherance of business has been specified in GST. However the following business test is normally applied to arrive at a conclusion whether a supply has been made in the course or furtherance of business. 1.Is the activity, a serious undertaking earnestly pursued. 2.Is the activity is perused with reasonable or recognizable continuity. 3.Is the activity conducted in a regular manner based on sound and recognizable business principles. 4.Is the activity predominantly concerned with the making of taxable supply for consideration/profit motive. The test insure that occasional supplies, even if made for consideration, will not subject to GST. Q. An individual buys a car for personal use and after a year sells it to a car dealer. Will the transaction be a supply in terms of MGL? Give reasons for the answer. Ans. No, because supply is not made by the individual in the course or furtherance of business. Further, no input tax credit was admissible on such car at the time of its acquisition as it was meant for non-business use.

By CA Tax Consultant (indirect tax) Sanjay Sabran & Comapany Taxation of Composite contract under GST 1. The intention is here to tax works contract(Includingany transfer of property in goods in the execution of contract) related to immovable property as supply of service.Works contractas well as saleof under construction apartment shall besubjected to GST. Currently servicetax charge on 40% of project value,thus the effective servicetax rate is 6%, similarly effectivevat rate around 1% chargeon project valuein different state. We should waitfor what will betax rate on work contractin new tax regime. 2. Now, question arises in mind what will betreatment of composite contractrelated to movable property, the concept of compositesupply and mix supply has been insertin GST Law Nov, 2016. 3. Once it is clear thatwork contractwill be tax in GST as goods or service, the distinction between goods and service is relevantonly for Placeof supply and Pointof Taxation. 4. The transaction of sale/purchaseof immovableproperty shall beoutsidethe ambit of GST and shall beliableto stamp duty and property tax under state law.  2. A transaction of works contract,is now, sometimes, taxed twice; firstly as saleby the State Government and secondly as serviceby the Central Government. Works contracts can straddletwo taxableactivities asper the current law.There is of coursesupply of goods. Then, due to the very nature of the contract, there is supply of services. As of now, the supply of goods is taxablein the form of Value Added Tax (VAT), whilethe services element is taxableas servicetax. In law, there have been differingviews of the Supreme Court and the High Court\u2019s on the applicability of this theory. The final word of the Apex court in BSNL and Others vs. Union of India (SC 2006) was that the aspects doctrinepertains to legislativecompetence and not the application of taxation on the same components of a transaction. At present, State VAT laws havespecific provisionsfor taxingworks contracts.To avoid taxingthe services element, these laws and associated rules providefor either separation of labour and materials or percentage deductions in transaction value.Another method is of prescription of a lower rate of tax in a composition/lump-sumscheme for works contracts.The servicetax lawhas also provided for similar treatment to avoid taxation of saleof goods as partof a works contract. The overarching concept in a GST is one of supply which subsumes the concepts of sale of goods, provision of services and manufacture. In GST Model, goods as well as services will be taxed on a uniform rate. Therefore the dispute whether a transaction is subjected to VAT or Service tax comes to end. After article 246 of the Constitution,the following article shall be inserted, namely:\u2014 \"246A. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and, subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State. (2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax where the supply of goods,or of services,or both takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. In article 366 of the Constitution,\u2014 (i) after clause (12), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:\u2014 \u2018(12A) \u201cgoods and services tax\u201d means any tax on supply of goods,or services or both except taxes on the supply of the alcoholic liquor for human consumption;\u2019; All supply of goods or services or both will attractCGST (to be levied by Centre) and SGST (to be levied by State) unless kept out of purview of GST. GST will beapplicableeven when the transaction involves supply of both (goods and services).In effect, woks contracts will also attractGST. As GST will be applicableon supply \u2018the erstwhiletaxableevents such as manufacture\u2018, sale\u2018,provision of services etc. will losetheir relevance. For taxinga transaction in GST, two things are important one is supply and other is goods or serviceor both Transition Provisions under GST Goods and/or service suppiedon or After appointedday--tax has beenpaidata rate spacefied under GST (Sec 159 ofGST) Goods and/or service suppiedon orafter appointedday,No tax under GSTwherepayment has beenreceived anddepositebefore appointed day.(Sec 160 ofGST) Goods and/or service suppiedon or before appointedday-No taxwherepart payment is received afterappointedday ,iftax has been paid under theearlierlaw.

(5) The tax liability on a composite or a mixed supply shall bedetermined in the followingmanner \u2014 (a) a composite supply comprising two or more supplies, one of which is a principal supply, shall be treated as a supply of such principal supply; (b) a mixed supply comprising two or more supplies shall be treated as supply of that particular supply which attracts the highest rate of tax. Section 2(49) \u201cGoods\u201d means every kind of movable property other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before supply or under a contract of supply; Section 2(92) \u201cServices\u2019\u2019 means anything other than goods.

Now, we discusstheprovision of draftGST Provisions related to Composite contract, Section 2(27) \u201cComposite supply\u201d means a supply made by a taxable person to a recipient comprising two or more supplies of goods or services, or any combination thereof, which are naturally bundled and supplied in conjunction with each other in the ordinary course of business, one of which is a principal supply; Section 2(78) \u201cPrincipal supply\u201d means the supply of goodsor services which constitutes the predominant element of a composite supply and to which any other supply forming part of that composite supply is ancillary and does not constitute, for the recipient an aim in itself, but a means for better enjoyment of the principal supply Example: Indian Airlines provides passenger transportation service.They also supply food on board to passengers.Supply of transpor tation services would be the principal supply and theserviceas a whole would qualify as compositesupply. Section 2(66) \u201cMixed supply\u201d means two or more individual supplies of goods or services, or any combination thereof, made in conjunction with each other by a taxable person for a single price where such supply does not constitute a composite supply Composite Contract In relationto immovable property Work contract Sec 2(110) & schedule II Sale ofunder constructed property (Sechedule II) In relationto movable property Composite supply Sec2(27) Mixed supply sec 2(66) Treatment and process to other person goods ScheduleII 2 or more supplies of goods/ services Naturally bundled One principal supply  5. Examples: Supply of soap bars where soap boxes are given free of cost; supply of wheat for which a bottle of honey is given free of c ost. In the above example of honey being supplied with wheat, both wheat and honey will betaxed at the rate of tax applicablefor honey (being commodity taxed at higher rate). The provision of declared service continue without any modification, in GST law also, for removing any ambiguity of taxation of work contract, the work contract and sale of under constructed property shall be subjected to tax as service under GST. Schedule II define the matters to be treated as supply of goodsor service and Sec 2(110) defines the work contract. Schedule II MATTERS TO BE TREATED AS SUPPLY OF GOODS OR SERVICES 5.

They have never been good about managing money. They are both retired now and on a fixed income, and they have been asking me or one of my four adult siblings for money to help with their bills each month. \n \nI don't mind giving, but recently my siblings and I have become annoyed because, while they continue to ask for money, at the same time they are also taking short trips, which include hotels and rental cars, and inviting friends out to dinner. \n \nThey also have a storage locker full of junk that eats up several hundred dollars a month. We have offered to help them clean out the locker, and possibly make money from some of the items in there, but they never commit. Should my siblings and I continue to help, or should we put our collective feet down? -- ANNOYED IN ALAMEDA, CALIF. \n \nDEAR ANNOYED: Put your collective feet down. You and your siblings are good children, but it's time for an intervention. Before giving your parents more money, you should all sit down with them and help them to create a budget, taking into account their fixed income and what you children can afford as a supplement. Then tell your parents they must live within that budget. Period. Their expenses must be trimmed, and the storage unit would be an excellent place to start. \n  Jan 29, 2017 - Letter 2 of 2   \nReport this ad \n  \nDEAR ABBY: How do you discourage someone's friendliness without being rude? \n \nAn elderly man recently moved in with his family in our neighborhood. He roams the neighborhood and approaches anyone he sees to introduce himself and start a conversation. He doesn't seem to have dementia, as he knows where and who he is, but his behavior is a little odd (such as asking for the precise spelling of everyone's first name). \n \nUnfortunately, now that he has met my husband and me, he comes up and knocks on the door to chat -- weekdays, evenings, weekends. The last time I was outside with my three kids, he approached with a stack of photos and proceeded to show me at least 100 prints of a trip he had taken abroad -- 10 years ago. \n \nI feel trapped because I don't want to be mean to an old man, but I dread seeing him stroll down the road. What is the best way to deal with this situation? -- WANTING TO WITHDRAW \n \nDEAR WANTING: The poor man is probably lonely and looking for human contact. Because you are not prepared to engage in his \"neighborly\" conversations, the next time he strolls by, tell him that you do not have time to chat right now. If he knocks on your door, tell him that you are busy or that you will be leaving shortly. And suggest to him that he may want to find a senior center so that he can make friends with contemporaries and won't feel so isolated. \n Share this Article","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Siblings Start to Resent Funding Parents' Shortfall","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"UExpress.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169789513","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"UExpress.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.uexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199975239","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11930","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Amagansett","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"East Hampton Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172130649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"East Hampton Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.easthampton.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695199985201","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Starring acclaimed newcomer Brian Geraghty (The Hurt Locker, We Are Marshall) in a breakout, star-making performance, Easier with Practice tells the touching and provocative story of Davy, a 28-year-old writer on a road trip to promote his unpublished collection of short stories. A random phone call in Davy's motel room from a mysterious, sexy woman named Nicole leads to a series of phone sex sessions that surprisingly over time become emotionally and sexually satisfying for the shy writer. Later, when he meets a former girlfriend, he must try to choose between them - but only if he can arrange a meeting with his reclusive phone mate. \n\nAuthor: TVMovieTrailer \nTags: Drama  Comedy  Romance  Easier with Practice  Marguerite Moreau  Katie Aselton  Jenna Gavigan  Jeanette Brox  Kel ONeill  Brian Geraghty  \nPosted: 29 January 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MovieTrailer.IO"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Easier with Practice Trailer","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Dailymotion","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590919259","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dailymotion","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Film"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailymotion.com"},"dataFormat":"video","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199987285","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s1.dmcdn.net/gqeJT/x240-_fv.jpg"},{"url":"http://s1.dmcdn.net/gqeJT/1280x720-Krs.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Iran said Trump\u2019s wide-ranging order, which was signed on Friday and, among other things, prevents most travellers from Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Yemen from entering the US, was insulting and that it would respond in kind while the restrictions are in place, Efe news reported on Saturday. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said the measure would backfire and promote more violence and extremism. \u201cDespite its false claims of combating terrorism and ensuring the safety of the American people, (the executive order) will go down in history as a big gift to extremists and their supporters,\u201d it said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani earlier had indirectly criticised another Trump executive order that assigns federal funds for the construction of a wall on the border separating the US and Mexico. The current era is one of \u201creconciliation and coexistence and not of putting up walls between countries,\u201d he said. A further deterioration in Iranian-US relations was expected with the coming to power of Trump, who has repeatedly criticised the nuclear deal signed in July 2015 between Iran and six major world powers. \n  This work by Middle East Monitor is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License .

We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\u201d \n \nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships. \n \nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others. \n   Starship Technology spokesman Henry Harris-Burland says the founders are looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry which has seen little efficiency improvement from new technology | © AFP/File | MANDEL NGAN   \nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues. \n \nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland. \n \nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \u201ccustomers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\u201d and collect the goods at the door. \n \n\u2013 Mapping sidewalks \u2013 \n \nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers. \n \nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots. \n \nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector. \n \nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. \n \nStarship says one of its strong points is its \u201cvisual localization\u201d technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets. \n \n\u201cWe can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \n\u201cA lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\u201d \n \nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \u201c99 percent autonomous,\u201d according to the spokesman. \n \n\u201cWe want a human being able to oversee the robot\u2019s journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\u201d he said. \n \nHarris-Burland said the company\u2019s tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism. \n \nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \u201cto the nearest inch,\u201d he said. \n \n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New wave of robots set to deliver the goods","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roodepoort Record","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"535027901","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"368"},"name":"Roodepoort Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://roodepoortrecord.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199991706","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. NEWARK, NEW JERSEY\n\nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. Dozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. Dozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. A crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations.\n\nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday.\n\nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported.\n\nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said.\n\nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours.\n\nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" Protesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released.\n\nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition.\n\nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released.\n\nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said.\n\n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said.\n\nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke.\n\n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\"\n\nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come?\n\n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" About 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. A protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" About 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil.\n\nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. Hundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. As motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Canyon","zipCode":"83651","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Nampa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho Press-Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668891","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"419"},"name":"Idaho Press-Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahopress.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695199994067","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/idahopress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/58/458950d6-1c6c-5e2c-9bc0-601f61368549/588d7e543a1e2.image.jpg?resize=512%2C335"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/idahopress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/58/458950d6-1c6c-5e2c-9bc0-601f61368549/588d7e543a1e2.image.jpg?resize=300%2C196"}],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d\n\nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view.\n\nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d\n\nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d\n\nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite previously made headlines when he and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright.\n\nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout.\n\n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d\n\nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned.\n\nFor more on UFC on FOX 23, check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Martin","zipCode":"34994","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stuart","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TCPalm","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660687","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"298"},"name":"TCPalm","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tcpalm.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695199995697","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"},{"url":"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/dana-white-post-ufc-on-fox-23.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The youngest participant in NHL history. A Sidney Cosby moment. A Connor McDavid burst of speed.\n\nThe 2017 NHL All-Star Skills Competition had something for everyone. Here are five takeaways:\n\nThe star of the NHL Skills Competition was Ryker Kesler. That\u2019s not a mistake. Not Ryan Kesler.\n\nRyan let his son Ryker, 6, take his place in the breakaway challenge and he for the only goal the Pacific Division scored in that event.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got ice in his veins,\u201d Kesler said of his son. \u201cI was more nervous than he was.\u201d\n\nRyker high-fived everyone on the ice after the impressive goal. Asked how it felt, Ryker said: \u201cExcited.\u201d\n\nArizona Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith is generally regarded as the NHL\u2019s best puck-handling goalie and he showed why at the NHL Skills Competition.\n\nIn a new event called the Four Line Challenge, Smith shot a puck almost 180 feet into a small opening in the opposite goal.\n\nThe crowd erupted. That shot would be challenging for even a top-scoring NHL forward. It seems like a miracle shot for a goalie.\n\n\u201cIt surprised me as much as anybody else,\u201d Smith said.\n\nNo one should be shocked. Smith is the last NHL goalie to score a goal in a regular-season game, producing an empty-netter against the Detroit Red Wings on Oct. 19, 2013.\n\nYoung stars are the talk of the NHL this season. Connor McDavid, 20, leads the NHL in scoring and Auston Matthews, 19, is the darling of Toronto. Both of those players were in the accuracy shooting event at the skills contest.\n\nWho won? Neither.\n\nMatthews looked impressive, breaking four targets in five shots in 12.28 seconds. McDavid needed more than 15 seconds.\n\nBut Sidney Crosby, 29, reminded everyone why he is considered the most skilled player in the game by downing four targets in 10.7 seconds. McDavid did win the Fastest Skater Competition.\n\nMORE NHL:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem as if Montreal Canadiens defenseman Shea Weber has a true challenger for the title of NHL\u2019s Top Gun.\n\nWeber won the hardest shot competition for the third consecutive year with a shot clocked at 102.8 mph, much lower than his 108.5 in 2015 and the 108.1 he recorded last season. Winnipeg Jets rookie Patrik Laine was second at 101.7.\n\nWas the radar gun having an off night? Only two shots surpassed 100 mph.\n\n\u201cMaybe it was location of the shots,\u201d Weber said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It could have been a number of different things. Maybe for some reason we just weren\u2019t feeling it tonight.\u201d\n\nWayne Gretzky said one reason why he jumped at the invitation to coach the Metropolitan Division in Sunday\u2019s All-Star three-on-three tournament (3:30 ET, NBC) was because his roster will have Crosby and Alex Ovechkin.\n\nWill he put them together in the three-on-three format? Given Gretzky\u2019s passion for the drama of sports, the guess is he will.\n\n\u201cIf he and I are going to play together, it is going to be fun,\u201d Ovechkin said after the Skills Competition.. \u201cI\u2019m going to try passing the puck because I\u2019m a passer now.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kevin Allen"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NHL Skills Competition delivers something for everyone","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Martin","zipCode":"34994","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stuart","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TCPalm","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660687","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"298"},"name":"TCPalm","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["IceHockey","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tcpalm.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/ryan-kesler-ryker-kesler-nhl-all-star-skills-competition","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212397054484905-USP-NHL-NHL-ALL-STAR-GAME-SKILLS-COMPETITION-88384156-1-.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695199995866","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:38:57Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212397054484905-USP-NHL-NHL-ALL-STAR-GAME-SKILLS-COMPETITION-88384156-1-.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

They work on their standard 2-3 zone, which they utilized Saturday against Kentucky after facing an early 12-point deficit, and also their triangle-and-two, which they played for a few possessions, too.\n\nMORE HOOPS:\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t going to be any educational videos on that zone,\u201d Self said. \u201cBut we would not have won the game unless we switched up.\u201d\n\nSelf said he hasn\u2019t changed defenses that much in one game in a while \u2014 at least, not without foul trouble dictating the decision, like it did when Kansas played Georgia back in November. But he wanted to do something to shake Kentucky\u2019s shooters. Plus, he was dealing with an unusually short rotation after announcing the indefinite suspension of Carlton Bragg Jr. prior to Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cI thought our zone won the game for us for one reason: It allowed Frank (Mason III) and Devonte\u2019 (Graham) to play 37 minutes for us and not be totally gassed,\u201d Self said.\n\nMason and Graham make up one of the nation\u2019s top backcourts, and they went up against another of the country\u2019s best in Kentucky\u2019s. But, as it often does, experience trumped youth. There was no panic or fear in either player\u2019s eyes as Kansas faced that early hole. They knew they\u2019d been in situations like this before and could turn things around. They understood why and how the zone helped, and how to do whatever was required to leave Rupp with a win. It helped slow down the game, and it helped guard against Kentucky\u2019s greatest strength \u2014 its transition offense.\n\n\u201cIt also gave us a chance to catch our breath on the defensive end because we don\u2019t have that many guys,\u201d Mason said. \u201cHopefully we don\u2019t have to do it too much more because we take pride in playing man and defending our man.\u201d\n\nMORE HOOPS:\n\nThere were myriad other reasons Kansas walked out of this arena with arguably its gutsiest win of the season \u2014 coming off a loss at West Virginia, without Bragg and amid a police investigation into an alleged December rape in which five Kansas players are considered witnesses. Freshman Josh Jackson was the best freshman on the court, outshining Malik Monk, De\u2019Aaron Fox and the rest of the Kentucky superstars who sputtered down the stretch while Jackson and company took over.\n\nBut the best example of all of why Self and his program are so good and, more important, so consistently good is this: That he switched to a zone defense against one of the most dynamic offenses in the country \u2014 and it worked. It wasn\u2019t notable, it wasn\u2019t tricky. But it forced Kentucky to work harder and play differently, and the 'Cats couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nIt was that simple.\n\nBEST OF THE WEEK","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nicole Auerbach"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Switch to zone paves way for Kansas comeback against Kentucky","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Martin","zipCode":"34994","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stuart","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TCPalm","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660687","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"298"},"name":"TCPalm","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tcpalm.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2jJqbJO&text=Switch%20to%20zone%20paves%20way%20for%20Kansas%20comeback%20against%20Kentucky&via=usatoday","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2jJqbJO&mini=true","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212403301544950-USP-NCAA-BASKETBALL-KANSAS-AT-KENTUCKY-88383864.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695199996666","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:31:49Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212403301544950-USP-NCAA-BASKETBALL-KANSAS-AT-KENTUCKY-88383864.JPG"},{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f4f66bfee48378c9d8cc1fb2a490a8697375a683/c=0-237-747-659&amp;r=x633&amp;c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212403301544950-USP-NCAA-BASKETBALL-KANSAS-AT-KENTUCKY-88383864.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

The six other countries are: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the White House said. \n \n\"I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,\" Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon. \n \n\"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\" he said. \n \nCivil rights groups condemned the measures as discriminatory, and said they would strand refugees in dangerous places and would tarnish the reputation of the United  States as a land welcoming of immigrants. \n \nThe details of the order - which had been rumored for days - were not available until Friday evening, leaving people affected scrambling to figure out what it meant. \n \nThe impact was immediate, causing \"chaos\" for Arab-Americans who had family members already en route for a visit, said Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \n \nAyoub said the order could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others. \n \nThe order is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants. \n \nSmyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. \"Those two 18-year-old daughters won\u2019t be able to join their mother in the U.S.,\" she said. \n \nSyrian Refugees \n \nTrump had promised the measures - called \"extreme vetting\" - during last year's election campaign, saying they would prevent militants from entering the United States from abroad. \n \nThe rise of Islamic  State in Syria and Iraq, which fueled a flood of migrants into Europe, combined with a series of attacks in France and Belgium heightened concerns in the United States about taking in refugees from Syria. \n \nTrump's order suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution. Trump said in an interview with a Christian news outlet the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. \n \nStephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said prioritizing Christians could be unconstitutional. \n \n\"If they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,\" he said. \n \nBut Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump\u2019s action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. \n \n\"It\u2019s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,\" Spiro said. \n \nTrump's order had been expected to include a directive about setting up \"safe zones\" for Syrian refugees inside the country, but no such language was included. \n \n\"President Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\" said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \n \nSource: Reuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump suspends refugees, 7 Muslim countries entering US","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"M6K","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"West Toronto","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Times Kuwait","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"442661835","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Times Kuwait","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://timeskuwait.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695199996831","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

My problem is not with faith but with religion as an organization, which has been used as a means of control, to pit people against each other, and to incite terror and war. Religion in this context serves the purposes of many various global elitist agendas.\n\nReligion is also confusing, to say the least; within several different religions exist different \u2018sects,\u2019 each with their own teachings and version of the \u2018truth\u2019 and how to live one\u2019s life. Within Christianity alone, t are multiple versions of the Bible, and teachings that contradict one another. What one religion says in one part of the world may directly oppose what another says in a different part of the world. This alone is a recipe for feelings of confusion and isolation for anybody who is seeking \u2018the truth.\u2019 If various religions preach different ways of life and truths, they all can\u2019t be correct, can they? I guess that\u2019s why they call it faith.\n\nBelow is a video of Jon Shelby Spong, a retired American bishop of the Episcopal Church, discussing these problems. He argues that religion is a business and it is used as a control mechanism (and he\u2019s not the first insider to do so). We can see this happening most clearly in the rise of Islamophobia. Islam has been turned into a scapegoat, a target at which we can direct all our fears and anger, and an excuse to invade other countries and create a more intense global national security state. But the truth is, Islam has nothing to do with violence or terrorism. These manufactured fears are all part and parcel of \u2018false flag\u2019 terrorism, which you can read more about if you are unfamiliar with the concept.\n\nIn the video, Spong affirms that \u201creligion is always in the control business, and that\u2019s something people don\u2019t really understand. It\u2019s in the guilt producing control business.\u201d He then goes on to describe the problem with religion as an organization: Every church I know claims that we are the true church, and they have some ultimate authority. . . . The idea that the truth of God can be bound in any human system by any human creed by any human book, is almost beyond imagination for me. God is not a Christian, God is not a Jew or a Muslim or a Hindu a Buddhist; all of those are human systems which human beings have created to try to help us walk into the mystery of God. He is describing the difference between faith and religion. I myself have explored multiple religions, and have discovered teachings within all of them that deeply resonate with me. I\u2019ve also found teachings that don\u2019t resonate at all. I don\u2019t believe one religion has all the answers. Using fear to coax people into a certain way of life or belief system, just like the Bishop mentions above, seems to be common practice in nearly every religion, and that certainly doesn\u2019t resonate with me. The history of the church itself is problematic. Whether it be the church\u2019s role in the in Canada, or the European crusades, the church has a history of forcing their views upon others and of condemning science and new discoveries. Furthermore, as the Bishop says above, people need to accept responsibility for the world. If we simply leave global change in the hands of God, we remove our own responsibility and agency in this world. If we want to change the world, WE have to do it. After the Paris terrorist attacks, the Dalai Lamai expressed this as well, arguing that it\u2019s not enough to just pray. We must take responsibility for our planet. We are also dealing with texts that are very old, and considering t are multiple versions of various texts, all of which have likely been manipulated, changed, and distorted over the years, I find it difficult to accept any one without question. Another point that turns me away from religion is hypocrisy. Many people claim ties to their faith yet know very little about its tenets, and fail to follow what they claim to believe in. This is commonly seen within the \u2018spiritual\u2019 movement as well, which can be seen as another form of religion in itself. When it comes to religion, I believe you have to do your own research; you have to read the books and examine the teachings for yourself. Use your own head and find what resonates with you instead of allowing yourself to be indoctrinated and letting someone else do your thinking for you. These texts are open to interpretation; it\u2019s up to you to find meaning in them and apply it to your life. You can still believe in God and not be religious. Religion is a manmade construct, and I think if God were to suddenly appear somew, he or she would have no idea what religion even was. Religions as organizations are going to have to change. New discoveries are constantly being made that are challenging long-held belief systems. We cannot grow if we refuse to have an open mind and accept new possibilities about the nature of reality, and it\u2019s childish to hold on to old belief systems just because they are familiar. I personally believe in the soul and other non-material phenomena, as well the idea that life does not end on Earth, and I believe t is enough evidence in various forms, aside from my own intuition and gut feeling, to support this stance. What about you? What do you believe? What it all boils down to, for me, is respect. We must learn to respect each other\u2019s viewpoints about \u2018what is.\u2019 We need to work with each other and accept our differences so we can focus on helping the planet, our shared home. \u201cIt\u2019s a mark of an educated person to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it.\u201d What do you think about religion and what Spong is saying in this video?

He and his teammates couldn't overcome their dreadful start despite the effort they delivered in the final 26 minutes. \n \nThe Leopards clawed as close as one point in the second half, forcing Loyola University Maryland coach G.G. Smith to call a timeout with 10 minutes, 1 second to play. The Greyhounds steadied themselves with a 10-0 spurt and held on for a 70-62 win in a Patriot League men's basketball game Saturday afternoon at Kirby Sports Center. \n \n\"We knew they were going to come out and just really pressure us,\" Lafayette coach Fran O'Hanlon said. \"I thought we did a terrific job after the first 10 minutes of just starting to defend and playing with some energy that we needed. \n \n\"You expend so much energy trying to get back into that game. At the end, they made the plays when we had cut it. You've got to give them credit. We had some momentum.\" \n \nLafayette (6-15 overall, 2-8 Patriot League) looked like it might get blown off its home floor for a third straight game early. The Leopards trailed by 10 points just over 5 minutes into the game. They were down 37-9 when Cam Gregory dropped in a layup with 6:30 to play in the opening half. \n  \nLindner led Lafayette's rally. He scored a team-high 21 points and handed out seven assists while playing all 40 minutes. Eighteen of his points and all his assists came in the final 26:30. \n \n\"To be honest, I think we started to play a little bit angry,\" Lindner said. \"We're on our home floor, and we go down that fast that much, it was a little bit embarrassing. I think every single one of us just dug down and played harder because that's just not how we want to go out in any game. \n \n\"I think our team showed great resiliency and some maturity for a young team.\" \n  \nLoyola Maryland's top three players made sure it wouldn't squander its huge lead. Jarred Jones, Gregory and Andre Walker combined for all 10 points during the 10-0 run the Greyhounds' produced after Lafayette closed within 48-47. Lafayette never got closer than two possessions again. \n \nGregory led Loyola Maryland (11-10, 5-5) with 21 points and 14 rebounds. His size and strength inside helped the Greyhounds amass a 42-20 edge in points in the paint. \n \nJones added 18 points, going over 1,000 for his career. Walker, a 6-0 junior, scuffled through a 1-for-13 day from the field but grabbed seven rebounds. \n \nMatt Klinewski scored 10 points and had five rebounds to join Lindner in double figures for Lafayette. Parkland High School graduate Kyle Stout chipped in with eight points and four boards. \n \nLafayette couldn't produce enough offense to avoid a seventh straight loss since its 2-1 start to Patriot League play. The Leopards' schedule grows tougher when the calendar flips to February. Five of their final eight Patriot League games come on the road, including trips to Boston University and Bucknell. \n \n\"You come out of this game wanting to win the next one, just hungrier to win the next one, because it doesn't get easier in this league,\" Lindner said. \"The balance in this league is unbelievable, so if we can string together a winning streak, you never know where we could end up.\" \n \nsamiller@mcall.com \n \nTwitter @mcall_smiller \n \n610-82","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Stephen Miller"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lafayette men's basketball team can't complete rally in loss to Loyola Maryland","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Howard","zipCode":"21044","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Howard County Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688613","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Howard County Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.baltimoresun.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/sports/college-sports/loyola-greyhounds-ORSPT000640-topic.html","http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/sports/college-sports/patriot-league-ORSPT000871-topic.html"],"sequenceId":"695199999701","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:44:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d4f71/turbine/mc-loyola-lafayette-mens-basketball-20170128/600"}],"video":[]}}

Step back!\" the agents shouted at them.\n\nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over.\n\nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys.\n\nNassauer had no clear answer.\n\n\"We are as much in the dark as everybody else,\" said the border protection official at one of the largest US airports.\n\nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees.\n\nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not.\n\nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at US airports.\n\nReckless\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \"reckless\" to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups.\n\nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines.\n\nAffected travellers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).\n\nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump's executive order banning them.\n\nBut some lawful permanent residents \u2013 those with so-called green cards \u2013 were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel.\n\nAt about 10 pm on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveller reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA.\n\nA senior administration official said Trump's order - aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans.\n\n\"There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official told reporters in a briefing. \"It would be reckless and irresponsible to ... broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you're going to take.\"\n\nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate.\n\n\"I\u2019m not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn\u2019t briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\" the official said.\n\nOut of the loop\n\nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials.\n\nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said.\n\n\"Was there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government\u2019s most complex endeavours, involving seven agencies from the US Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments.\n\nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies - or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them - who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president's order.\n\n\"If the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\" said one of the officials, referring to the White House.\n\nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump's order.\n\nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \u201climited department participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\" the official said.\n\nChaos at airports\n\nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a US Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans.\n\nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with US military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys.\n\nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country.\n\nBut dozens of others were less fortunate.\n\nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order.\n\nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency's communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \"not included\" in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise.\n\nThe Trump administration official later told reporters that US green card holders travelling outside the United States need to check with a US consulate to see whether they can return.\n\n\"It's being cleared on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe green card issue has left immigration attorneys confused about how to advise their clients. Attorney David Leopold, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he is erring on the side of caution, advising his clients to stay in the United States to avoid being stranded abroad.\n\nThat can create some agonizing dilemmas.\n\n\"A Syrian doctor who has a dying mother in Europe cannot go visit her not knowing that he will be able to get back into the United States,\u201d Leopold said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"How Trump's abrupt immigration ban created confusion at airports, agencies","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/world/americas/2017/01/29/how-trump-s-abrupt-immigration-ban-created-confusion-at-airports-agencies&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695200006427","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T13:51:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/29/trump-ban-airport.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Trump+ban+airport.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She seemed to have little patience for the arguments presented by the government, which focused heavily on the fact that the two defendants named in the suit had already been released. At one point, she visibly lost patience with a government attorney who was participating by phone. \n\nDonnelly noted that those detained were suffering mostly from the bad fortune of traveling while the ban went into effect. \"Our own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\" she said at one point, noting that, had it been two days prior, those been detained would have been granted admission without question. \n \n\n \nDemonstrators block traffic at the airport arrival terminal as they protest against muslim immigration. \n \nIn the middle of the hearing ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt informed the court that he'd received word of an imminent deportation to Syria, scheduled within the hour. That prompted Donnelly to ask if the government could assure that the person would not suffer irreparable harm. Receiving no such assurance, she granted the stay to the broad group included in the ACLU's request. \n\nAfter the decision was made, Donnelly asked the government if they could provide a list of those being detained to the ACLU. The government's attorneys indicated that they could not. \"It is more difficult than it sounds,\" U.S attorney Susan Riley said. \n\nThe ACLU said it had won a stay in federal court preventing implementation of the executive order. \n \n\n \nProtest against Donald Trump's order to ban muslim immigration in the US. \n \nAs President Donald Trump's order targeting citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries reverberated across the world on Saturday, it became increasingly clear that the controversial measure he had promised during his presidential campaign was casting a wider net than even his opponents had feared. \n\nConfusion and concern among immigrant advocates mounted throughout the day as travelers from the Middle East were detained at U.S. airports or sent home. A middle-of-the-night lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqi men challenged Trump's executive action, which was signed Friday and initially cast as applying to refugees and migrants. \n\nBut as the day progressed, administration officials confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted U.S. legal residents from the named countries - green-card holders - who happened to be abroad when it was signed. Also subject to being barred entry into the United States are dual nationals, or people born in one of the seven countries who hold passports even from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom. \n\nThe virtually unprecedented measures triggered harsh reactions from not only Democrats and others who typically advocate for immigrants but also key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Canada announced it would accept asylum applications from U.S. green-card holders. \n\nYet Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigrants and impose what became known as his \"Muslim ban,'' was unbowed. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it. \n \n\"It's not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\" \n\nThough several congressional Republicans denounced the order, the vast majority remained silent and a few voiced crucial support - including, most prominently, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had rejected Trump's anti-Muslim proposals during the campaign. \"This is not a religious test, and it is not a ban on people of any religion,'' Ryan said Saturday. \"This order does not affect the vast majority of Muslims in the world.\" \n\nThe president's order, signed Friday, suspends admission to the United States of all refugees for 120 days and bars for 90 days the entry of any citizen from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. That list excludes several majority-Muslim nations - notably Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia - where the Trump Organization, now run by the president's sons, is active and which in some cases have also faced troublesome issues with terrorism. \n\nAccording to the text of the order, the restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the United States without a visa because of terrorism concerns. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering powerful and wealthy majority-Muslim allies, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. \n\nAmid widespread confusion on Saturday about how the order will be enforced, some administration officials acknowledged that its rollout had been chaotic. Officials tried to reassure travelers and their families, pointing out that green-card holders in the United States will not be affected and noting that the Department of Homeland Security is allowed to grant waivers to those individuals and others deemed to not pose a security threat. It can take years for someone to become a green-card holder, or lawful permanent resident authorized to permanently live and work in the country. \n\n\"If you've been living in the United States for 15 years and you own a business and your family is here, will you be granted a waiver? I'm assuming yes, but we are working that out,'' said one official, who could not be more specific because details remained so cloudy. A senior White House official later said that waivers will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that green-card holders in the United States will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country. \n\nBut officials made clear that the federal officers detaining refugees and migrants with valid U.S. visas and restricting them from entering the country were following orders handed down by top DHS officials, at the White House's behest. \n\nThe order drew cries of outrage from a range of activist and advocates for Muslims, Arabs and immigrants. More than 4,000 academics from universities nationwide signed a statement of opposition and voiced concern the ban would become permanent. They described it as discriminatory and \"inhumane, ineffective and un-American.\" \n\nThe executive action has caused \"complete chaos\" and torn apart families, said Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \n \nAt Dulles International Airport, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) addressed more than 100 people protesting Trump's order. \n\n\"We want to know who is being detained and why they are being detained,\" McAuliffe said. \"I remind everybody we are a land of immigrants. . . . Discriminatory tactics breed hatred.'' His remarks were cheered by demonstrators holding signs saying \"Refugees welcome here\" and \"Stand with Muslims.\" \n\nIn New York City, lawyers for two Iraqi men detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport - one of whom served the U.S. military mission in Iraq - filed a federal lawsuit challenging the order as unconstitutional. They also are seeking class certification so they may represent all refugees and visa-holders who are being held at U.S. ports of entry. \n\nOne of the men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released Saturday afternoon without explanation from federal officials. \"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,'' he told reporters. \"This is what pushed me to move, to leave my country and come here. . . . America is the land of freedom - the land of freedom, the land of the right.'' \n\nWhile immigration advocates said at least one refugee family had been detained at San Francisco International Airport, there was no immediate count of how many refugees were being held at airports nationwide. Advocates said that ticketed passengers also had been barred from boarding U.S.-bound flights overseas, and they confirmed that green-card holders who left the United States have been unable to return. \n\nIn Cairo, airport officials said seven U.S.-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented Saturday from boarding an EgyptAir flight to JFK Airport, according to the Associated Press. \n\nOther advocates promised further legal challenges. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) denounced the order and said it would file a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional. \n\n\"There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\" Lena Masri, CAIR's national litigation director, said in a statement. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\" \n \nIn a conference call with reporters, immigration lawyers and advocates said Trump's order violated the Constitution, along with U.S. and international laws that guarantee migrants the right to apply for asylum at the border and the Immigration and Nationality Act, which forbids discrimination in the issuance of visas based on race, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. \n\nBut Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, praised Trump for taking action to pause the refugee resettlement program and limit immigration from the seven countries. \n\n\"It's a prudent measure,\" he said. \"It's not the end of the world. It's not the Statue of Liberty crying. The reaction has been hyperbolic.\" \n\nThe effects of Trump's order played out nationwide. In Dallas, Behzad Honarjou, 43, was supposed to pick up his mother, 70-year-old Shahin Haffanpour, at the airport on Saturday. But when she arrived from Iran via Dubai, she was told that because of the executive order she would be sent back to Iran the next morning. \n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" Honarjou said. He said he was seeking an attorney to file an emergency habeas petition, but the courts were closed. Haffanpour has an immigrant's visa issued by the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, last year. \n\nIn Philadelphia, Sarah Assali said six relatives from Syria - two uncles, their wives and two cousins - were detained after arriving at the airport there early Saturday. Although they are Christian immigrants with valid visas to join family in this country, they were put on a plane back to Doha, Qatar, three hours later, Assali said. \n\nShe said her family members were not allowed to call or contact their family in the United States before being removed. \"We don't know what's going to happen next.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"US Court stays order after Donald Trump's ban on refugees, migrants causes outrage","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"M6K","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"West Toronto","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Times Kuwait","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"442661835","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Times Kuwait","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://timeskuwait.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200007918","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

News  \n Tesla Motors, Inc. (MM) (NASDAQ:TSLA) \nIntraday Stock Chart  \nToday : Sunday 29 January 2017 \n    A Wall Street Journal Roundup   \nTechnology industry executives expressed personal dismay and concern for their companies in reacting to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. \n \nIn company emails, interviews and posts published online, leaders from companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. framed the order as one at odds with a nation that welcomes foreigners and an industry that counts foreign-born executives in its upper ranks. In doing so, they broke with weeks of cautious engagement with the new administration. \n \nHere is a rundown of their statements. \n \nApple CEO \n \nTim Cook \n \nTeam, \n \nIn my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration--both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. \n \nI've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. \n \nThere are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We're providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company. \n \nAs I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there's one thing I know about the people at Apple, it's the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It's as important now as it's ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. \n \nApple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. \n \nIn the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, \"We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.\" \n \nMicrosoft CEO \n \nSatya Nadella \n \nAs an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic. \n \nMicrosoft President \n \nBrad Smith \n \nAs a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called \"Dreamers.\" We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nGoogle CEO \n \nSundar Pichai \n \nWe're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S....It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. \n \nUber Technologies CEO \n \nTravis Kalanick \n \nExpedia CEO \n \nDara Khosrowshahi \n \nOurs is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the U.S. with my family after the Iranian revolution. I don't have an Iranian passport and have never been back but have no idea if I'm on a list someplace listed as an Iranian citizen. And I'm a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders. But we have a responsibility as the world's greatest nation. And we sure aren't acting our part. \n \nFacebook \n \nCEO \n \nMark Zuckerberg \n \nMy great-grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that. \n \nLike many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. \n \nWe need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nTesla Motors \n \nCEO \n \nElon Musk \n \nMany people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected....The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges \n \nTweets: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568 and https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561 \n \nCode.org CEO \n \nHadi Partovi \n \nMy family left Iran to escape a bloody war when I was 11, during the Reagan administration. America welcomed us as legal immigrants with visas. Code.org and the Hour of Code wouldn't exist otherwise. \n \n(Facebook post here.) \n \nAirbnb CEO \n \nBrian Chesky \n \nOpen doors brings all of US together. Closing doors further divides US. Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them. \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/825407087085645824 \n \nY Combinator President \n \nSam Altman \n \nThe tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers--if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nNetflix \n \nCEO \n \nReed Hastings \n \nTrump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. \n \n(Facebook post here.) \n \nSalesforce.com CEO \n \nMarc Benioff \n \nWhen we close our hearts & stop loving other people as ourselves (Mk 12:31) we forget who we truly are--a light unto the nations. #noban \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/825470203299377152 \n \nUber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick \n \nOur People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the U.S., are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are traveling outside of the U.S. now or anytime in the next 90 days. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact [email protected] immediately. \n \nThis order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the U.S. will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families--and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time. \n \nWe are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the coming days. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nBox CEO Aaron Levie \n \nOn every level--moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.--this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/levie/status/825424282679283712 \n \nTwitter \n \nCEO \n \nJack Dorsey \n \nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. \n \nTweets: https://twitter.com/jack/status/825476172658200577 \n \nSlack Technologies CEO \n \nStewart Butterfield \n \n\"And he's just getting started.\" -- It's still so hard to believe that this is real life. Nearly every action seems gratuitously...evil. \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/stewart/status/825431304112009217 \n \nLinkedIn CEO \n \nJeff Weiner \n \n40% of Fortune 500 founded by immigrants or their children.

Dropbox embraces people from all countries and faiths \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/825462890949861377 \n \nEBay CEO \n \nDevin Wenig \n \nOver the past several months, I've talked with you repeatedly about my unyielding commitment to our company's values. I've been clear that we will always stand up for those values and act in the interests of our employees and customers....I believe this decision fundamentally contradicts our company's values and America's values. \n     \n(END) Dow Jones Newswires \n \nJanuary 29, 2017 02:36 ET (07:36 GMT) \n Copyright (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Tech Executives React to Trump Immigration Order in Their Own Words -- Update","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ADVFN UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"256583693","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"ADVFN UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.uk.advfn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568","https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561","https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/825407087085645824","https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/825470203299377152","https://twitter.com/levie/status/825424282679283712","https://twitter.com/jack/status/825476172658200577","https://twitter.com/stewart/status/825431304112009217","https://twitter.com/jeffweiner/status/825437102162792451","https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/825462890949861377"],"sequenceId":"695200010242","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, with the team\u2019s most recent game a loss to Long Beach State, the Aggies had to get back on the right track with UC Riverside coming into town, and they prepared as such.

Gross considers the team\u2019s defense to be a work in progress. \n \n\u201cDefensively, our goal is to play like it\u2019s the championship possession every single possession, and we\u2019re still working on that with our urgency and our communication,\u201d Gross said. \u201cThere\u2019s always places where we\u2019re looking to improve, but like I say, it\u2019s always fun to improve while you\u2019re winning.\u201d \n CIERA PASTUREL / AGGIE  \nThat third quarter proved to make a significant difference for the Aggies, who outscored  the Highlanders 26-4 \u2014 UC Riverside was never able to climb out of the hole it dug itself earlier in the game. Gianotti said that attacking the opponent was always part of the plan. \n \n\u201c[Coach] Jen warned us in the beginning: \u2018We have to jump on them right from the start.\u2019\u201d Gianotti said. \u201cThe whole team was in attack mode mentality, and we were super confident coming from the first half making shots. So we were like, \u2018Just keep pushing, just get shots and we\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u201d \n \nThe Aggies victory against UC Riverside proved to be a foundation for future success, as they picked up another win against Cal State Fullerton on Saturday on Jan. 26 at the ARC Pavilion with a final score of 59-39. \n Written by: Bradley Geiser \u2014 sports@theaggie.org","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bradley Geiser \u2014 sports@theaggie.org"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"UC Davis women\u2019s basketball team rides monstrous third quarter to victory over UC","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Yolo","zipCode":"95616","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Davis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"California Aggie","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169789670","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"81"},"name":"California Aggie","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theaggie.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200014546","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://theaggie.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wbbucr_sp_Ciera_Pasturel1.jpg"},{"url":"https://theaggie.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wbbucr_sp_Ciera_Pasturel2-200x300.jpg"},{"url":"https://theaggie.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wbbucr_sp_Ciera_Pasturel3-200x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waikato Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169690101","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Waikato Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200019573","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 30 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200020635","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport on Friday night and was detained for about five hours.\n\nTrump's order signed on Friday upended the travel plans of people without U.S. citizenship who were arriving in the United States from those seven countries, including Syria, Iran and Sudan, causing confusion and sparking protests at airports as immigrants and refugees were stranded.\n\nElamin said she had been in Sudan for academic research and boarded a plane on Friday morning. After presenting her U.S. green card, a designation of legal permanent residence, at JFK, she said she was questioned, patted down and handcuffed.\n\n\"It was an uncomfortable pat down, they touched my breast area and my groin area,\" Elamin said in a phone interview. \"Then I got handcuffed and I just started crying.\"\n\nElamin said the handcuffs were soon removed and it appeared authorities were using them to escort people between areas of the airport. \n\nElamin was released, but she worried about leaving the country again and about her parents in Sudan, whom she hoped one day to help immigrate to America. \n\n\"It scares me that I'm not able to see them if I want to,\" said Elamin, who lives in New Jersey. \n\nTrump's executive order means legal permanent residents who have passports from the seven countries have to be cleared back into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which overseas entry at airports, in a statement later said it will \"treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.\" \n\nThe executive order also upended the plans of some people planning to leave the United States. \n\nShirana Navabha, 57, a U.S. citizen originally from Iran, said she was scheduled to fly to Iran on Sunday, but will not go after Tehran said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Trump's action.\n\n\"I told everybody that I'm coming, everyone was so excited and now I'm not going, it's just frustrating,\" Navabha, who lives in Dallas, said by phone. \n\n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates) X","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Alex Dobuzinskis"},"topics":[{"name":"Sudan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"North Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"'I got handcuffed and just started crying' - Sudanese student describes U.S. detention","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Reuters UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587711","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Reuters UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Regional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.reuters.com/","publisher":"Thomson Reuters"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&taboola_utm_source=cox-clarkhoward&taboola_utm_medium=bytaboola&taboola_utm_content=thumbnails-b:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20SC"],"sequenceId":"695200023489","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11050","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Washington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Port Washington Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169717623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Port Washington Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.portwashington.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695200024407","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 31 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Palm Beach","zipCode":"33410","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Palm Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WPBF","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"name":"WPBF","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wpbf.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200026609","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Instead, I saw a group of people standing for something \u2014 standing for equality, for the environment, for kindness, for unity. \n \nMihaela Karst | Argonaut \n  \nThat was what I went home thinking about after the march. I marveled at the possibility that thousands of people from all backgrounds could come together in an attempt to bring awareness to current issues. \n \nTo be clear, the Women\u2019s March was not a protest against President Trump demanding he steps down from his new position. For every anti-Trump poster, I saw two posters demanding safety for the LGBTQA community, three posters demanding gender equality and five posters demanding the world take better care of the earth. \n \nAnd for the few posters I did see referring to President Trump, I only saw references to his treatment of women in the past \u2014 not demands that he vacate the White House. I saw personal quotes demonstrating verbal abuse to women, all in an attempt to bring awareness that this treatment is unacceptable. \n \nRegardless of opinion, President Trump is not going away. He is now the President of the United States of America \u2014 and the nation knows that. \n \nTo me, the Women\u2019s March was simply a demonstration that we, as a country, stand as one, united against prejudice, hate and anger. The amount of kindness and strength I felt while walking along the streets of Moscow was unparalleled. \n \nI felt part of a greater force, and it gave me hope that no matter the trials the country may face, there is enough good to overcome it. \n \nIt was not a time for \u201ccrybabies\u201d to come together and mourn the loss of Hillary Clinton.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Clark","zipCode":"45503","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Springfield News Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657029","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1604"},"name":"Springfield News Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.springfieldnewssun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200077353","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D.

But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 32 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200078154","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 32 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02494","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Needham Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCVB.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"352601084","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"415"},"name":"WCVB.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcvb.com","publisher":"Hearst Television, Inc."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200078335","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When creating skin, instead of cartridges and colored inks, injectors with biological components are used. \n \n\"Knowing how to mix the biological components, in what conditions to work with them so that the cells don't deteriorate, and how to correctly deposit the product is critical to the system,\" said Juan Francisco del Canizo, from the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon in Spain. \n \nThe act of depositing these bioinks is controlled by a computer, which deposits them on a print bed in an orderly manner to then produce the skin. \n \nThe process for producing these tissues can be carried out in two ways: to produce allogeneic skin, from a stock of cells, done on a large scale, for industrial processes; and to create autologous skin, which is made case by case from the patient's own cells, for therapeutic use, such as in the treatment of severe burns. \n \n\"We use only human cells and components to produce skin that is bioactive and can generate its own human collagen, thereby avoiding the use of the animal collagen that is found in other methods,\" researchers said. \n \n\"This method of bioprinting allows skin to be generated in a standardised, automated way, and the process is less expensive than manual production,\" said Alfredo Brisac, CEO of BioDan Group, bioengineering firm in Spain. \n \nThe research was published in the journal Biofabrication. \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"New 3D bioprinter can create functional human skin","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200080198","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:40Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87125","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KOAT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659419","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"169"},"name":"KOAT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.koat.com"},"dataFormat":"video","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200087394","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/traveler-released-at-jfk-airport-1485651543.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

We just want to keep peer-reviewed \u2018factually accurate\u2019 climate science flowing out of U.S. institutions,\u201d the group said in one of its first tweets. \n \nOver the next few days, dozens of \u201crogue\u201d or \u201calt\u201d Twitter accounts emerged, including @RogueNOAA (for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), @RogueNASA (for the space agency) and @alt_fda for the Food and Drug Administration. \n \nAnother account called AltEPA (@ActualEPAFacts), with more than 150,000 followers, aims to offer data that might be suppressed by the Environmental Protection Agency. \n \n\u201cHe can take our official Twitter but he\u2019ll never take our FREEDOM,\u201d the account says. \u201cUNOFFICIALLY resisting.\u201d \n \nThe messages were gaining traction with hashtags such as #ResistTrump, #ClimateFacts and #Twistance, although it was not clear if the messages were coming from federal employees themselves. \n \nMyron Ebell, the former head of Trump\u2019s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency, says he expects the new administration to seek significant budget and staff cuts. \n \nEbell said it is reasonable to expect the president to seek a cut of about $1 billion from the EPA\u2019s $8 billion annual budget. He also said Trump is likely to seek significant reductions to the agency\u2019s workforce. \n \nSome of the Twitter handles, according to various tweets, have been turned over to people outside government to avoid potential reprisals. \n \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer denied the administration is trying to suppress free expression among federal employees. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s come from the White House, absolutely not,\u201d he said when asked if the White House had ordered a clampdown. \n \nBut according to The Washington Post, Trump personally expressed anger to the head of the U.S. park service over the inauguration day photos and ordered him to produce images to show a stronger turnout for his ceremony. \n \nPhilip Howard, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute who has studied the role of social media in the Arab Spring uprisings, said he sees some parallels to those events. \n \n\u201cWhenever governments try to close up the supply of information, people look for new ways to express themselves and share information,\u201d Howard said. \n \n\u201cSocial media resistance was an important part of the Arab Spring, during which protesters successfully used social media to turn roiling dissent into massive street protests. It is hard to know if social media will have the same role in the U.S., because Trump and his political communication team are already actively there on Twitter and Facebook.\u201d \n \nJohn Wonderlich, executive director for the Sunlight Foundation, a group promoting transparency in government, called these actions unprecedented. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a new kind mass resistance from employees who feel they can\u2019t talk to the public, and they are finding alternative channels,\u201d Wonderlich said. \n \n\u201cWhat is amazing is the public response, which is amplifying those voices.\u201d \n \nStill, Wonderlich said the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to suppress and control data have raised concerns about the trustworthiness of information from the government. \n \n\u201cWhat we are seeing from the White House is anti-science, anti-government, anti-civil service and broad politicization of the federal workforce,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cAll government information under a Trump administration is going to be inherently suspect.\u201d \n \nBut because anyone can create a Twitter account and claim to represent a constituency, this makes it difficult to separate truth from misinformation, Wonderlich said. \n \n\u201cThis means a new model of verification (is needed), and no one has figured that out,\u201d he said. \n \nThe environmental fight is moving into the courts as well. The night before Trump\u2019s inauguration, five environmental lawyers filed a federal court brief defending an Obama administration clean-water rule that the new president and his Republican allies have targeted for elimination, considering it burdensome to landowners. \n \nThe move served as a warning that environmentalists are prepared to battle in court against what they fear will be a wave of unfavorable policies concerning climate change, wildlife protection, federal lands and pollution. \n \nAdvocacy groups nationwide are hiring more staff lawyers, coordinating with private attorneys and firms, reviewing statutes, setting priorities and seeking donations. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all-out war,\u201d said Vermont Law School professor Patrick Parenteau. \u201cIf you\u2019re an environmentalist or conservationist, this is indeed a scary time.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s first week in office only heightened their anxieties. He moved to resume construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines that the Obama administration had halted, while signaling intentions to abandon his predecessor\u2019s fight against global warming, vastly expand oil and gas drilling on public lands and slash the EPA\u2019s budget. \n \nGOP lawmakers, meanwhile, introduced measures to overturn a new Interior Department rule barring coal mining companies from damaging streams and to remove some wolves from the endangered species list.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Social media news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"After Trump's move to control information, 'resistance' movement coalesces on social media","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"JP","country":"Japan"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Japan Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733710","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Japan Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.japantimes.co.jp","publisher":"Japan Times"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200097674","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport, their lawyers and two U.S. representatives accompanying them tried to cross into a secure area \u2014 and were stopped themselves. \n \n\u201cStep back! Step back!\u201d the agents shouted at them. \n \nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over. \n \nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys. \n \nNassauer had no clear answer. \n \n\u201cWe are as much in the dark as everybody else,\u201d said the border protection official at one of the largest U.S. airports. \n \nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees. \n \nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not. \n \nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports. \n \nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \u201creckless\u201d to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups. \n \nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines. \n \nAffected travelers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). \n \nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump\u2019s executive order banning them. \n \nBut some lawful permanent residents \u2014 those with so-called green cards \u2014 were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel. \n \nAt about 10 p.m. on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveler reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA. \n \nA senior administration official said Trump\u2019s order \u2014 aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\u201d the official told reporters in a briefing. \u201cIt would be reckless and irresponsible to \u2026 broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you\u2019re going to take.\u201d \n \nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn\u2019t briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\u201d the official said. \n \nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials. \n \nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said. \n \n\u201cWas there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government\u2019s most complex endeavors, involving seven agencies from the U.S. Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments. \n \nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies \u2014 or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them \u2014 who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president\u2019s order. \n \n\u201cIf the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\u201d said one of the officials, referring to the White House. \n \nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump\u2019s order. \n \nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \u201climited department participation.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\u201d the official said. \n \nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a U.S. Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans. \n \nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan. 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with U.S. military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys. \n \nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \n \nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country. \n \nBut dozens of others were less fortunate. \n \nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order. \n \nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency\u2019s communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \u201cnot included\u201d in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise. \n \nThe Trump administration official later told reporters that U.S. green card holders traveling outside the United States need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s being cleared on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the official said. \n \nThe green card issue has left immigration attorneys confused about how to advise their clients. Attorney David Leopold, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he is erring on the side of caution, advising his clients to stay in the United States to avoid being stranded abroad. \n \nThat can create some agonizing dilemmas. \n \n\u201cA Syrian doctor who has a dying mother in Europe cannot go visit her not knowing that he will be able to get back into the United States,\u201d Leopold said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jonathan Allen"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"How Trump's abrupt Muslim ban sowed confusion at airports and agencies","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"JP","country":"Japan"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Japan Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733710","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Japan Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.japantimes.co.jp","publisher":"Japan Times"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200098645","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

claims that pornography has got \u201cuglier and nastier,\u201d with actors forced to shoot more hard-core films for less since the explosion of free-to-view internet sites like Youporn and Pornhub. \n \n\u201cPornocracy,\u201d made by Ovidie, a former French porn star turned director, claims that far fewer films are now being made and fees have been slashed up to 10-fold. \n \nShe blames \u201ctube\u201d sites \u2014 so called because they resemble YouTube \u2014 which have been accused of hosting thousands of videos pirated from traditional adult entertainment companies. \n \nCritics say children are also getting their first exposure to sex through the sites. \n \nAnd they worry about the effect porn culture is having on the way teenage boys treat girls. \n \n\u201cTubes\u201d are also blamed for making porn consumption so commonplace that last week London\u2019s transport system was forced to warn that people who watch porn on buses and trains would be reported to the police. \n \nChildren\u2019s campaigner Marie Derain, an adviser to the French women and families minister, said the exploitative nature of \u201ctube\u201d sites is extremely worrying. \n \n\u201cTheir economic model goes beyond even what is at stake in terms of pornography,\u201d she said. \n \nGregory Dorcel, who heads Marc Dorcel, Europe\u2019s third-biggest adult entertainment group, said 95 percent of the 100 billion porn clips watched on the web last year were pirated. \n \nHis company alone has made 5 million requests to Google for its videos to be taken down from \u201ctubes.\u201d \n \n\u201cBut 48 hours later the videos are back online,\u201d Ovidie said. \n \nHer documentary claims that a little-known company called MindGeek \u2014 headquartered in \u201can empty office\u201d in Luxembourg \u2014 is now porn\u2019s most powerful player, holding a monopoly-like grip on the industry. \n \nBut MindGeek, which prefers to be seen as a tech company, and makes no reference to porn on its website, said it operates only four \u201ctube\u201d sites \u2014 Pornhub, Youporn, RedTube and Tube8. \n \n\u201cClaims that we dominate the industry are nonsense,\u201d a spokeswoman said, saying that only three of its sites ranked in the top 10 of the world\u2019s most visited adult sites. \n \nPornhub alone, however, is the 11th-most-viewed site in the U.S., just behind Wikipedia, Twitter and Instagram. \n \nMindGeek says it is simply a platform for its \u201c1,000 content partners that upload content and benefit from the exposure on our sites.\u201d \n \n\u201cThere is lot of misinformation about how tube sites function,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \n \nShe said it followed YouTube\u2019s lead on \u201cmanaging the issue of copyrights.\u201d \n \n\u201cThere is no room in our model for the assumption that content is pirated,\u201d she added. \n \nShe claimed instead that they had \u201cformed positive, symbiotic relationships with most of the major players in the industry.\u201d \n \nMany traditional adult film makers dispute this, also complaining that while they are subject to strict regulations on age, the \u201ctubes\u201d can easily be viewed by children. \n \nThe French pressure group Ennocence, which is trying to make regulation of the \u201ctubes\u201d an issue in the country\u2019s coming presidential election, said children now tend to first view porn at 11. \n \nIts president, Gordon Choisel, said they are being bombarded with adult images through internet advertisements from a very young age. \n \n\u201cYou think your child is watching a cartoon, but then a window pops up with porn,\u201d he said. \n \nChoisel said governments had to attack the sites\u2019 advertising streams. \u201cWe have to come up with legislation that is flexible enough to adapt to changes in technology and the way videos are being watched,\u201d he said. \n \nDerain, author of a 2012 report on children\u2019s viewing habits, said porn is shaping many young people\u2019s view of sex. \n \n\u201cSexuality in real life is not like that,\u201d she said, but children who have grown up watching \u201ctubes\u201d have trouble making the distinction. \n \n\u201cI have been involved in a number of very serious criminal cases where boys have systematically done to girls what they saw on porn,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cPornocracy\u201d also dealt with the explosion in \u201ccam girl\u201d sites and what Ovidie termed the \u201cnew proletariat of sex\u201d who work long hours on them. \n \nShe said the women get only around 15 percent of what their clients pay to watch them perform online. \n \nUp to 70 percent goes to such platforms, including Live Jasmin, also based in Luxembourg, which has annual revenue of more than $300 million and has made its owner, Gyorgy Gattyan, Hungary\u2019s second-richest man, according to Forbes magazine. \n \nBut Marton Fulop, the operations director at Live Jasmin, which is often called the \u201cpeep show Uber,\u201d justified the amounts paid to its 2 million registered cam girls, saying it is a tech company \u201cthat provided a very good platform.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Porn 'tube' sites threaten children and actors, critics

On Fox News, Rudy Giuliani has taken credit for assembling a group of people who he claims drafted it. Giuliani states that Trump wanted a \"Muslim ban\" and that he needed a way to do it legally. According to Giuliani, his team decided to focus on countries rather than religion to give it \"a factual basis\" in terrorist threats, \"not a religious basis.\" \n\nBenjamin Wittes rips into the order in a long post titled, . The whole thing is worth reading, but here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\nIs this document a reasonable security measure? There are many areas in which security policy affects innocent lives but within which we do not presumptively say that the fact that some group of people faces disproportionate burdens renders that policy illegitimate. But if an entire religious grouping finds itself irrationally excluded from the country for no discernible security benefit following a lengthy campaign that overtly promised precisely such discrimination and exactly this sort of exclusion, if the relevant security agencies are excluded from the policy process, and if the question is then solemnly propounded whether the reasonable pursuit of security is the purpose, I think we ought to exercise one of the sovereign prerogatives of philosophers\u2014that of laughter.\n\nSo yes, the order is malevolent. But here\u2019s the thing: Many of these malevolent objectives were certainly achievable within the president\u2019s lawful authority. The president\u2019s power over refugee admissions is vast. His power to restrict visa issuances and entry of aliens to the United States is almost as wide. If the National Security Council had run a process of minimal competence, it could certainly have done a lot of stuff that folks like me, who care about refugees, would have gnashed our teeth over but which would have been solidly within the President\u2019s authority. It could have all been implemented in a fashion that didn\u2019t create endless litigation opportunities and didn\u2019t cause enormous diplomatic friction.\n\nHow incompetent is this order? An immigration lawyer who works for the federal government wrote me today describing the quality of the work as \"look[ing] like what an intern came up with over a lunch hour. . . . My take is that it is so poorly written that it\u2019s hard to tell the impact.\" One of the reasons there\u2019s so much chaos going on right now, in fact, is that nobody really knows what the order means on important points.\n\nTonight a handful of federal judges have temporarily blocked parts of the order. As the Post summarizes the first two judicial rulings: \n\nA federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States after an executive order from President Trump targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nJudge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn granted a request from the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the deportations after determining that the risk of injury to those detained by being returned to their home countries necessitated the decision.\n\nMinutes after the judge\u2019s ruling in New York, another came in Alexandria when U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema issued a temporary restraining order to block for seven days the removal of any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport. Brinkema\u2019s action also ordered that lawyers have access to those held there because of the ban.\n\nJust a few minutes ago, a third order was entered by the federal district court in Massachusetts. And there was another such order tonight from the district court in Seattle. In case you\u2019re wondering, three of the four court orders were handed down by Democratically-nominated judges. \n\nThe important thing to watch going forward, in my view, is the Trump Administration\u2019s response to the judges\u2019 actions. In normal times, an Administration spokesperson would express respectful but firm disagreement with these preliminary rulings and say that the Administration is considering its options for further review while of course complying with the orders in the interim. I certainly hope the Trump Administration follows that safe path. At the same time, I sense a decent chance that Trump\u2019s response will be different. \n\nFor example, will Trump single out the judges, criticizing them personally as he did Judge Curiel? Will Trump take on the federal judiciary as a whole, or at least its Democratic appointees, making them another part of his \"opposition party\"? And in the worst-case scenario, will he echo Andrew Jackson, or at least the possibly apocryphal version of him, and order executive branch employees to ignore parts or all of the court orders? \n\nI hope Trump does none of those things. If he does, however, it will be important to see how others in the federal government \u2014 in all three branches \u2014 respond. As always, stay tuned.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Orin Kerr"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Four federal judges issue orders blocking parts of Trump's executive order on immigration","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","state":"District of Columbia","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Washington Post","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169587503","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"19007"},"name":"Washington Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.washingtonpost.com","publisher":"Washington Post Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=3568","https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0","https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/825448574028804096","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GKL6i38pI","https://lawfareblog.com/malevolence-tempered-incompetence-trumps-horrifying-executive-order-refugees-and-visas","https://twitter.com/sdooling/status/825601265493241856","https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3437037/Seattle-Order-20170128.pdf","http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/06/11/what-trump-has-said-judge-curiel/85641242/","http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/27/media/opposition-party-media-donald-trump/","http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316115-trump-hangs-portrait-of-andrew-jackson-in-oval-office"],"sequenceId":"695200111256","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/02/volokh.jpg&w=606&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias"},{"url":"https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&amp;w=1484&amp;op=resize&amp;opt=1&amp;filter=antialias"}],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n \nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n \nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n \nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n \nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n \n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\" \n \n© Distributed by LAKANA.

But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D.

But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 30 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"27116","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winston Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WXII 12","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688608","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"92"},"name":"WXII 12","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wxii12.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200117342","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I was recently having a conversation about fashion with two very lovely middle-aged women and within a few minutes I was reduced to utter dismay. \n \nWhile one of them shyly confessed that she used to love wearing white but no longer does after being ridiculed for doing so, the other shamefacedly told me that she had been lusting after a pair of red shoes for ages but that her daughter had bluntly (and callously) told her that she was past it and that she should settle instead for some comfortable shoes that would be more befitting for her age. \n  While fashion cannot save the world, it has certainly saved many a woman from feeling like she had all the self-worth and autonomy of an old bag   \nNow I\u2019m not going to get into any dated clichés about age and wisdom and all that jazz because well, it\u2019s all a load of tosh and goes against my fundamental belief that a woman does not have to be young and a size 6 to be beautiful or to wear what she wants. Fashion is a small yet beautiful way to express yourself, and while it cannot save the world, it has certainly saved many a woman from feeling like she had all the self-worth and autonomy of an old bag. \n \nLife is too short not to buy the red shoes and the leather skirt, and well, it\u2019s certainly not done any harm to Tina Turner, and won\u2019t do any to you. Iris Apfel would hardly be Iris Apfel had she given two decaying figs about what her narrow-minded neighbour had to say about the colour of her stockings. \n \nWe should not be censoring other women from embracing themselves even as they get older; we should be promoting it and celebrating all the different things that make us individuals, without fear of judgement or reproach. \n \nMany girls my age talk about equality and giving a voice to everyone, yet many women who become mothers and grandmothers slowly find themselves edged towards the wings of their own lives, unable to afford the youthful currency they once had. \n \nIndeed, if age should teach us anything, it is the beauty of a woman who knows what looks good on her and who has the confidence to play up to her own strengths. \n \nAfter all, while age is an inevitable part of life, orthopaedic shoes aren\u2019t.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Anna Marie Galea"},"topics":[],"title":"The incredible invisible woman","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"MT","country":"Malta"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Times of Malta","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660702","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"87"},"name":"Times of Malta","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesofmalta.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200121445","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Americans hoped if these countries became prosperous, they stay away from communism and not align themselves with the Soviet Bloc. \n \nThe Marshall Plan remained in effect from 1948 to 1951. During that period, the United States gave out US$ 13 billion in aid. This was the beginning of the first Cold war, which seemed to end with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. \n \nHowever, the Cold War didn\u2019t completely cease. US bases in Japan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Korea, Guam and the Philippines assisted in containing Russia and China. The events of the last decade indicates that the world is bracing itself for a second edition of the Cold War. \n  \nMap showing the Colour Revolution \n  \nStarting from Georgia (Rose Revolution) in 2003, the Colour Revolution spread to Ukraine (Orange Revolution) in 2004, Kyrgyzstan (Tulip Revolution) and Lebanon (Cedar Revolution) in 2005. China and Russia have long wanted US troops out of their backyard in Central Asia. Many in Russia say that the Colour Revolution was orchestrated by US-funded Non-Governmental Organisations. Some analysts say that China is suspicious of US intentions because of the latter\u2019s presence in CAR. China feels that USA is trying to contain her. Others s feel that US presence in CAR aims at containing Russia. \n \nBooz Allen Hamilton, a US financial research firm, coined the term \u201cString of Pearls\u201d in its report in 2004. This term explained the way China would use dollar diplomacy to increase her influence in the countries around India. Though the Indian government does not give credence to this term, one can see Chinese footprint increasing in the countries around India. \n  \nMap showing Eastward Expansion of Nato \n  \nIt is generally clear that the targets of containment for the West are Russia and China. The map above, shows the Eastward expansion of Nato. Needless to say, this expansion is aimed at Russia, which is fighting back with her interventions in Georgia and Ukraine. Russia has restarted the Arctic Patrols suspended after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The strategic exercises by Russia towards the West began in 2013 and continue. This year, the strategic exercise codenamed Zapad-2017 is scheduled to be held in Western Russia. This month, Nato forces have moved into Poland (14 January 2017) and Norway (16 January 2017). This is part of the plan to deploy 3500 additional troops. 2700 troops have been deployed in Poland and 800 troops have been deployed in Norway. This deployment has made Russia feel uncomfortable. \n \nAs China\u2019s Comprehensive National Power ( The sum of its Hard Power and Soft Power) started growing, it has become clear that at some point, the US has to contend with her rise \u2014 peaceful or not. The relations between the US and China started improving after Mr Kissinger visited China in 1972, a move facilitated by Pakistan. But within seven years of restarting relations with China, the US enacted the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 which gave a clear indication that US was apprehensive of China. Though this was during the Cold War era, even in the post-Cold War period the US is making an increased effort to contain China. \n \nIn addition to its presence in CAR, the United States is carrying out activities which China construes as a concerted US effort to contain her. For example, the US has good relations and defence cooperation with Mongolia, China\u2019s northern neighbour. As Mongolia is located between Russia and China, it is only natural that her strategic location attracts the US attention. The US has proposed to deploy Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) systems in the Republic of Korea, which has evoked a strong reaction from China, which is attempting to maintain the balance of power in the Korean Peninsula by keeping good relations with North Korea. \n \nChina is overly sensitive to any incident happening in East and South China Sea. While China has strategic depth on land, it is the East and South China Sea that she is worried about. The US Base in Guam is on the second island chain that China is claiming. Recently, when China tested a DF 26 Missile, the Chinese media reported that it can target Guam. That is a clear indication that the US presence in Guam is playing on China\u2019s mind. \n  \nMap showing First and Second Island Chain that China claims \n  \nOn 12 July, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, ruled in favour of Philippines on the island in the South China Sea. As expected, this verdict drew a very agitated response from China. Though the US and other parties to the South China Sea dispute gave a muted response, Japan exhorted China to adhere to the ruling. Immediately after the verdict, China got Philippines to agree to a bilateral dialogue on the issue. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s adversarial stance with the United States helped the process. Another country that has been the cynosure of USA and China is Vietnam. The US resumed her relations with Vietnam in 1995, two decades after she withdrew troops from Vietnam. Ever since, their bilateral relations have been improving. China has also been trying to improve her relations with Vietnam. \n \nDuring the January visit of Vietnam Communist Party leader Nguyen Phu Trong to China, Chinese President Xi Jinping described relations between the two countries as \u201ccomrades and brothers\u201d. This despite the fact that both countries are locked in a bitter dispute over territory in the South China Sea.  Myanmar has seen increased interactions between her, the US and China. During the Maoist struggle in Nepal, the US was active in that country \u2014 which neighbours China. Improvements in the India-US relations are being seen with suspicion by China. Pakistan is a country that sees both China and USA trying to retain their respective influence. The contest for influence in Afghanistan between these two countries is increasing. \n \nWith Donald Trump\u2019s ascendance in the United States, international relations have been thrown into a state of flux. The US withdrawal from Trans- Pacific Partnership has opened the door to China, allowing it to move in and occupy its space. Trump\u2019s policy of countering China by receiving a call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-we. His administration\u2019s pronouncements on the South China Sea are all likely to increase the shadow boxing between the countries. The new US administration is also seeking to improve relations with Russia. The New York Times reported on 24 January, 2017 that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders to reduce US funding for United Nations and other organisations and also beginning the process to review some multi-lateral treaties. \n \nWhile the US has been the principal proponent of Cold War and Cold War 2.0, will the world see China as the proponent of Cold War 3.0? It will be interesting to watch China moving into the space created by withdrawal of United States from some of the multilateral treaties and agreements.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Vietnam news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"International relations news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cold War 2.0: Can China capitalise as Donald Trump rises, America withdraws from global stage?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"232003819","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"Firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200122739","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Obama, 55, went into the White House as a bestselling author for his books Dreams from My Father, published in 1995, and The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, published in 2006.\n\nThe only other US presidents to enter office as bestselling authors are Dwight D Eisenhower, for his 1948 book, Crusade Of Europe, and Donald Trump for his 1987 book, The Art of The Deal.\n\nObama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother, already has three books under his belt: Dreams from My Father; Audacity of Hope; and the children\u2019s\u2019 book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters (published in 2010). ALSO \"There\u2019s no doubt Obama\u2019s memoir will go for more than any president\u2019s has ever gone,\" Newberg told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAfter leaving office, George W. Bush got $7million (Sh728 million) for his 2010 Decision Points while Bill Clinton received $15 million (Sh1.56 billion) for his 2001 memoir, My Life.\n\nBush and Clinton sold 2.6 million and 2.2 million copies of their books respectively.\n\nPrinceton University presidential historian Julian Zelizer told the Hollywood Reporter that he thinks sales from Obama\u2019s memoir will top both.\n\n\"There is broader fascination with Obama, from conservatives who really hate him as well as liberals who deeply admire what he did,\" he said.\n\nObama, who likely will be represented by Washington lawyer Bob Barnett, recently told senior adviser turned CNN commentator David Axelrod that the book is his top priority. He has already hired Cody Keenan, former White House director of speech writing, to help. While every major publisher will bid for the rights to publish the book, Random House, which published Obama\u2019s 1995 memoir Dreams of My Father and 2006 The Audacity of Hope (combined sales of five million), as well as both the Clinton and Bush books, has the inside track.\n\nOne wild card: Obama might find a rival in wife Michelle, whom Newberg predicts will \"easily\" surpass the $8 million Hillary Clinton got in 2000 for her memoir.

In one of the most surprising productions of the year, Carly Wijs has written and directed a show about the Beslan school siege. It was created for Bronks, a Belgian theatre company specialising in work for young audiences. String marks the tripwires of the terrorists, and the tiny spaces in which the captives manoeuvre In 2004, Chechen terrorists held 1,200 people captive in a school in North Ossetia, Russia. After three days, during which some captives drank their own urine and ate flowers that had been brought in for teachers, 385 adults and children were dead. Footage from the siege shows people running half-naked towards safety, bodies on stretchers, gunfire, fear. But in Wijs\u2019s production, Gytha Parmentier and Roman Van Houtven, playing two of the children, explain the events with the earnest concentration of kids recalling the rules of a particularly absorbing game. \u2018Mercurial\u2019: Gytha Parmentier and Roman Van Houtven in Us/Them. Photograph: www.fkph.net The stage looks like a playroom. Parmentier and Van Houtven chalk out the layout of the school on the floor. Facts are scrawled on the blackboard. String marks the tripwires of the terrorists, and the tiny spaces in which the captives manoeuvre: the entire stage is enclosed in a cat\u2019s cradle. Balloons are burst, with the effect of explosions.\n\nThere are no tears, no screams. No cuteness. The gaze on what is happening is steady, though the pair\u2019s movement is mercurial: they dance some feelings and actions, slipping under and over the wires. In the background, occasional bursts of sonorous Slavic music hint at reverberations on the outside. It is an impressive evening, evoking the effects of trauma rather than the causes of the siege. It was one of the hits of last year\u2019s Edinburgh fringe. I wish I had seen it then, unprepared for its clear-eyed audacity: forewarning lessens the impact. \u2022","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susannah Clapp"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Us/Them review \u2013 an evocative retelling of the Beslan school siege","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/29/us-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/susannahclapp","http://twitter.com/susannahclapp","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Us%2FThem%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20evocative%20retelling%20of%20the%20Beslan%20school%20siege&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs%3FCMP%3","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Us%2FThem%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20evocative%20retelling%20of%20the%20Beslan%20school%20siege&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-car","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/us-them","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/beslan-school-massacre-ten-years","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/29/us-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs#img-2","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Us%2FThem%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20evocative%20retelling%20of%20the%20Beslan%20school%20siege&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs%3FCMP%3","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Us%2FThem%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20evocative%20retelling%20of%20the%20Beslan%20school%20siege&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","https://www.theguardian.com/world/beslan","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fus-them-beslan-siege-dorfman-review-carly-wijs&type=article&internalpagecode=3128073","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5nzzf","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/stage"],"sequenceId":"695200127036","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/178bf237685f68a3dc1a45ac9433b6cfa0394538/0_15_5511_3307/5511.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178bf237685f68a3dc1a45ac9433b6cfa0394538/0_15_5511_3307/master/5511.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=071918e65551e2e0643404018e234c04"}],"video":[]}}

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nelson Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744542","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Nelson Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200127605","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, witnessing the conduct of our elected representatives, I see it has been legalized. Democrats versus Republicans. Not just in Illinois, either; it is a national epidemic in our legislatures. Regardless of whether a solution is beneficial to the public who pay the taxes, it is vetoed because \"the other side thought of it.\" \n \nMeanwhile, because of this deadlock and legalized gang warfare, many people suffer due to cuts in services. I would suggest that not only should our elected representative pay be withheld, so should their benefits, per diems, etc. Once they are forced to survive without health insurance, travel assistance, etc. perhaps they will understand the position they have placed many citizens in. Maybe they will get off their lazy butts and do the job they were hired to do. \n \nOne other thing, the lack of an Illinois budget is not a new concept. This situation has come up many times in the past several years. One constant that I see in the equation is House Speaker Michael Madigan. I don't know him, he may be a great guy, but it would appear that regardless as to who the governor is, Mr. Madigan blocks all progress.

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Whitsunday Coast Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907553","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Whitsunday Coast Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.whitsundaycoastguardian.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200137149","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I want to specifically tonight reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.\" \n \n\"Now more than ever we need to remember the words on the Statue of Liberty,\" McCreary said in reference to the inscription on the sculpture that reads, in part: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" \n \nPresenting their father Tom Rothman with the Milestone Award, Elizabeth and Nora Rothman also subtly protested Trump as they took to the stage sporting pink \"pussy hats,\" receiving a standing ovation for their fashion statement. \n \nWhile presenting the Stanley Kramer award which honors the film that helps raise public awareness of important social issues to Loving, Thandie Newton said, \"We may lose the small battles but we will win the big war.\" Colin Firth, who was one of the film's producers, accepted the award saying, \"This is for Richard & Mildred Loving, the ACLU and for everyone whose families are being separated by the discrimination of others.\" \n \nThe air in the room appeared to shift as Celebrity Apprentice producer Mark Burnett accepted the award for outstanding producer of competition television. Soft boos and murmurs in the audience could be heard. \n \n20th Century Women producer Megan Ellison, upon receiving the Visionary award, told the crowd, \"The scariest thing we can do now, or ever, is to shut up.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"John Legend Slams Trump at PGA Awards, Mark Burnett Booed","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MSN Entertainment","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678247","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN Entertainment","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.msn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trumps-immigration-ban-sparks-outcry-as-protestors-rally-at-jfk-lax-airport-969587?utm_source=Microsoft&utm_campaign=Syndication&utm_medium=John+Legend+Slams+Trump+at+PGA+Awards%2C+Mark+Burnett+Booed"],"sequenceId":"695200139666","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And how do you find the lists in the mobile version? \n\nA: You can create lists \u2014 topical collections of accounts you follow \u2014 in the Twitter apps for Android and iOS, as well as on the web. To make a new list in the Android version of the Twitter app, tap your profile icon (or the menu icon) in the upper-left corner of the screen. In the menu that slides out, select Lists. \n\nOn the Lists menu, tap the plus (+) icon. On the New List screen, enter a name and a description for the new grouping. You can choose to keep the list private for your eyes only, or make it public so others can find it and subscribe to it \u2014 which can be helpful for things like lists of local government officials or members of a sports team. Tap the Save button. \n\nTo add accounts to the newly created list, visit the person or organization\u2019s profile page, which you can do by clicking or tapping its icon in your main Twitter feed. In the Android app, tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner, choose Add to List and pick the one you want to use. Repeat the process until you have added all the accounts you want on the list. \n\nOnce you have created a list, you can switch to it from your main Twitter feed by selecting your profile or menu icon in the upper-left corner of the app and choosing Lists from the menu. On the list of Lists, pick the one you wish to read. \nHow to Beta Test for Windows  \nQ: I found a link to the Windows Insider program in my Windows 10 settings the other day. What is involved in participating? \n\nA: Windows Insider is Microsoft\u2019s free preview program for its users to try out new works-in-progress versions of the operating system. This type of pre-release software is also known as a beta version, and it usually still has bugs to be worked out before the final release to the general public. Apple has a similar venture for volunteers called the Apple Beta Software Program. \n\nIf your PC meets the system requirements and you join up to become a member of the Windows Insider team, Microsoft allows you to download each new build of the next Windows version to learn, test and share your feedback. Microsoft is currently developing the new Creators Update of Windows 10, due out this spring. \n\nProceed at your own risk. On the sign-up page, Microsoft warns that you will be working with experimental software and that, \u201cYou might experience crashes, security vulnerabilities, data loss, or damage to your device.\u201d You need to share information about your use of the software with the company and you can pick a \u201cring,\u201d or frequency of updates. \n\nIf you only have one computer with specific programs you rely on to get things done, you may want to skip the Insider program and wait for the final version of the software to be publicly released. If you have a secondary PC (or a separate hard-drive partition) that is not vital to your computing needs \u2014 and you do not mind working with potentially unstable code \u2014 the program gives you a jump-start on new versions of the operating system. \n\nYou can sign up using the Windows Insider option within the current Windows 10 Settings app \u2014 in Settings, go to Updates & Security, then Windows Update and select Advanced Options. You can also sign up for the program on the Windows Insider page on Microsoft\u2019s website.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"J. D.

Kennedy International Airport on Friday night and was detained for about five hours. \n \nTrump's order signed on Friday upended the travel plans of people without U.S. citizenship who were arriving in the United States from those seven countries, including Syria, Iran and Sudan, causing confusion and sparking protests at airports as immigrants and refugees were stranded. \n \nElamin said she had been in Sudan for academic research and boarded a plane on Friday morning. After presenting her U.S. green card, a designation of legal permanent residence, at JFK, she said she was questioned, patted down and handcuffed. \n \n\"It was an uncomfortable pat down, they touched my breast area and my groin area,\" Elamin said in a phone interview. \"Then I got handcuffed and I just started crying.\" \n \nElamin said the handcuffs were soon removed and it appeared authorities were using them to escort people between areas of the airport. \n \nElamin was released, but she worried about leaving the country again and about her parents in Sudan, whom she hoped one day to help immigrate to America. \n \n\"It scares me that I'm not able to see them if I want to,\" said Elamin, who lives in New Jersey. \n \nTrump's executive order means legal permanent residents who have passports from the seven countries have to be cleared back into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security, which overseas entry at airports, in a statement later said it will \"treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.\" \n \nThe executive order also upended the plans of some people planning to leave the United States. \n \nShirana Navabha, 57, a U.S. citizen originally from Iran, said she was scheduled to fly to Iran on Sunday, but will not go after Tehran said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Trump's action. \n \n\"I told everybody that I'm coming, everyone was so excited and now I'm not going, it's just frustrating,\" Navabha, who lives in Dallas, said by phone. \n \n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Alex Dobuzinskis"},"topics":[{"name":"Sudan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"North Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"'I got handcuffed and just started crying' - Sudanese student describes U.S. detention","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"TheStar.com.my","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657869","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"TheStar.com.my","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Global","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thestar.com.my","publisher":"Star Publications (Malaysia) Berhad"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200151614","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But, still, in the middle of the locker room, the biggest reasons why the Clippers suffered their worst loss of the season were printed in easy to read letters. \n \nLong after the Golden State Warriors beat the Clippers 144-98, the white board \u2014 where the game plan is scribbled before each game \u2014 four two-word sentences were the only words not erased. \n \n\u201cPlay hard. Play smart. Play together. Have fun.\u201d \n \nThey\u2019re written there every game, and Saturday, they\u2019d never been ignored more. \n \n\u201cI agree,\u201d the Clippers\u2019 DeAndre Jordan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure it out because if not, we\u2019re going home early.\u201d \n \nThat Jordan is reflecting on the team\u2019s fate in April while the calendar still says January perfectly encapsulates the Clippers\u2019 issues against the Golden State Warriors \u2014 issues that couldn\u2019t have been easier to see if the team wore highlighter-green uniforms. \n \nAgainst the Warriors, everything seems bigger and more important because the Warriors \u2013 the NBA\u2019s best team \u2013 are better. \n \nThe Clippers\u2019 wins over San Antonio or Cleveland don\u2019t mean a thing inside Oracle Arena, where Golden State\u2019s beaten the Clippers 10 straight times. Against the Warriors (who have now won the last eight meetings between the two, no matter the venue), the Clippers just freeze. \n \n\u201cYou want it to so bad, you almost psyche yourself out of it,\u201d Blake Griffin said. \n \nIt\u2019s why Austin Rivers unleashed a few four-letter words when asked if the Warriors hold a mental edge over his team. It\u2019s why two early fouls to Griffin feels like a death sentence. It\u2019s why the first pass that sails into the seats seems to lead to another and another. And, it\u2019s why each Golden State basket \u2013 and boy, do these guys make baskets \u2013 feels like it\u2019s worth two or three times the points it puts on the scoreboard. \n \n\u201cThe mistakes kind of build,\u201d J.J. Redick said. \u201cAs they take advantage of it, it becomes like an avalanche. You saw that at the end of the first half.\u201d \n \nThe Warriors scored 17 points in 2 minutes and 38 seconds to close the second quarter, a stretch Redick described as \u201csome (expletive)\u201d that happened. \n \nStephen Curry, who scored 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter, closed the first half by sinking a one-footed jumper from beyond midcourt to beat the buzzer. \n \nWhile it\u2019s hard to simulate stopping Curry, the Clippers had the NBA equivalent to a bye week \u2014 three days off \u2014 to prepare. But once they got on the court, all the work and preparation simply got erased. \n \n \n\u201cA loss like this, it\u2019s made a lot worse with the type of effort we gave in stretches. For the whole game, we didn\u2019t play with the right type of attitude. We kind of went through the motions,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t attack. We had two great days of practice where we were attacking. Guys were playing hard. Defensively we were great. And, then to come out here on the stage that you were practicing for and not to do it, it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d \n \nThey didn\u2019t play hard enough. They didn\u2019t play smart enough. They weren\u2019t together, and they sure didn\u2019t have fun. \n \n\u201cWe were horrible,\u201d Doc Rivers said. \u201cI thought we gave in way too easy. You should never lose by this much in any game, in any situation. But they\u2019re better right now. \n \n\u201cUntil we improve, they\u2019re going to keep beating us.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dan Woike dwoike@scng.com @danwoikesports on Twitter"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Golden State Warriors blast L.A.

Throw a chair, a shoe (at him), he\u2019s going to shoot it.\u201d \n \nBut there once was a time where Speights wouldn\u2019t drift beyond the 3-point line, a place once reserved for the league\u2019s guards. \n \nBut when Steve Kerr got hired to coach the Golden State Warriors and Speights, he decided to see if the 6-foot-10 big man had a little Larry Bird in him. \n \n\u201cI went to him and said, \u2018Do you think you could take one more step out and become a 3-point shooter?\u201d Kerr remembered. \u201cI watched a ton of tape of him when I got the job and he was making one 22-footer after another. He was a pick-and-pop guy. He had a big Game 7 against the Clippers the previous year and had 10 or 12 points in limited minutes and hit some huge shots. But, he was never outside of that line. \n \n\u201cI just asked him what he thought.\u201d \n \nIn the first year after they spoke, Speights actually took 13 fewer 3\u2019s than he did the season before. But last year, his second with Kerr, Speights launched 62 3\u2019s \u2013 a new career high. And after making 38.7 percent of them, he signed with Clippers and got the greenest of lights. \n \nPrior to Saturday\u2019s game back in Oakland, Speights had taken 166 3-point shots \u2014 more than he attempted over his entire career. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been natural for him,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThree\u2019s aren\u2019t a hard shot for him.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Louis","zipCode":"63125","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Saint Louis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Deer Park-NorthBabylon Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"365387502","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Deer Park-NorthBabylon Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://deerpark-northbabylon.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695200168653","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He\u2019s an actor as well as playwright. \n \nThe Inspector will be representing T&T at the Caribbean Secondary Schools Drama Festival, which is planned for Antigua later this year. \n \nThe awards for the November 2016 local competition were distributed January 17. \n \nThe awards included the Zeno Constance Award for Most Original Script, the Victor Edwards Award for Directing, the James Lee Wah Award for Outstanding Production, the Mark D Moment Ltd Award for Stage Management, two Outstanding Actor Awards, a Supporting Actor Award, and certificates for Music and Best Ensemble Performance. \n \nMoodoo was overjoyed to have won the Victor Edwards Award for Directing and a Zeno Constance Award for Most Original Script. \n \nThe teacher was inspired to write the play after the 2015 jailbreak in Port-of-Spain and the Vindra Naipaul-Coolman trial of the accused murderers. He had put it aside, but finished it for the festival because he couldn\u2019t find a play with only roles for boys in it. Moodoo said he wanted to explore why a man who had broken out of prison would turn himself in, as happened in 2015. \n \nThe two main characters, the Inspector and Monster, meet on the San Fernando Wharf as a manhunt is continuing for the last escaped prisoner. Although Monster is disguised, the Inspector recognises him, but does not arrest him immediately. Through the use of storytelling and flashbacks, the Inspector finds out how Monster came to be called, and act like, a monster. \n \nMoodoo said that working with the students he felt a mixture of frustration and awe at their growth. The two main actors, Daniel Baptiste and Justin Lee, who played the Inspector and Monster, respectively, are Sixth Form students who came second and third in the Performing Arts Unit Two Cape Exam in the Caribbean. \n \n\u201cWorking with those two boys in particular was interesting and rewarding in the sense that they\u2019re two different types of actors: one was more naturally talented and the other one was more skilled in that once he worked on it, he got it, and it was good seeing the two of them, with their two different strengths, work together, fuelling off each others\u2019 energies.\u201d \n \nMost of the other actors were Form One students who had never seen a stage before. \n \nMoodoo said, \u201cI promised the Form One students an extra ten per cent in their final exams if they participated in Drama Festival, because only a very few people went on to do performing arts at a CXC or Cape level, and so I wanted to give them a love of theatre early.\u201d \n \nHe said what made the process enjoyable overall was that everyone contributed to the creative process. \u201cThe boys were very co-operative and I asked them to create a lot and I edited and moulded everything. \n \n\u201cWith the musicians, I also gave them full licence to create what they wanted and just told them what would and wouldn\u2019t work. It wasn\u2019t just me telling them what to do, but we tried different things on stage and eventually came up with the final product. The highlight of the process for me was the creation of a rock version of the National Anthem which ends the play, because the musicians just came together and created it spontaneously.\u201d \n \nMoodoo said he was glad to see the students\u2019 reactions when they won, especially Baptiste and Lee, who had gotten to the semifinals in previous performances. Moodoo pursued Theatre Arts at CXC and a Theatre Arts Degree at UWI, St Augustine. He acted in Willie Chen\u2019s Freedom Road in 2013, 3Canal\u2019s More Love in 2014, and Ayinde\u2019s Chalkboard\u2019s Doll\u2019s House and Iere Theatre\u2019s Sundar\u2014A Love Story in 2015. He has written the plays Under the Mango Trees and The Inspector, and is working on another play. \n \nThe Inspector will go on to represent T&T in the Caribbean Secondary Schools Drama Festival, as well as a school tour. Following this, Moodoo said, he wants to rewrite and add to the script and take it out to the public. \n \n\u201cThe focus of the play is to call out corruption. I think more people need to see it, as the content is important, especially in our current socio-political climate.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Moodoo\u2019s The Inspector wins Secondary School\u2019s Drama awards","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"TT","country":"Trinidad and Tobago"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Trinidad Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169704446","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Trinidad Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.tt"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200172049","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n\nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n\nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n\nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2450","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Coffs Harbour","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coffs Coast Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664965","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Coffs Coast Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200173555","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(Photo: George Maguire) \n   \nMags and David hard at work in the polytunnels at their farm in Drimoleague last week. (Photo: George Maguire) \n  \nA Drimoleague-based couple are selling their delicious edible blooms to top  restaurants and food firms \u2013 and it all started with a rash, writes  Marie Nolan \n \nA WEST Cork company is leading the way with a blooming great idea \u2013 edible flowers. \n \nBumblebee Flower Farm, based in Castledonovan, Drimoleague, supply their organically grown edibles to the city\u2019s prestigious Greene\u2019s restaurant on MacCurtain St, as well as more recently to fine foods specialists La Rousse. \n \nAnd Mags Riordan and husband Steve Davies feel so passionate about what they do, and are so keen to share the health benefits of their \u2018power flowers\u2019 that they are also considering a cookbook, as well as welcoming group tours to their farm. \n \nTheir journey to this point in their now very successful business came about via a rash on Mag\u2019s hand. \n \nMags, a professional florist, worked in what she calls the \u2018chemical flower industry\u2019 but always gardened organically at home. \n \nHowever, a persistent rash on her hands, which she felt was linked to her work, prompted her to investigate how flowers were grown. \n \nShe naturally wasn\u2019t naive enough to think flowers delivered to her from Europe were going to stay fresh without any intervention. \n \nBut the levels of chemicals used and other interventions horrified her. \n \nShe described it as a \u2018wake-up call\u2019 \u2013 so much so that, six years ago, she started to organically grow flowers on a scale that allowed her supply events like weddings and more. \n \nAnd it was a client bride who was concerned about her two-year-old flower girl eating her bunch of flowers that delivered the move into gourmet edibles in 2015. \n \nAfter a little research she found she was already growing lots of munchable options, including the humble dahlia, rose, Sweet William and common marigold. \n \nA Women in Business course, run by the West Cork Enterprise Board, literally changed everything, says Mags, ramping things up a gear and turning their efforts into a viable operation. \n \nMags and Steve now grow their blooms from six tunnels, and outdoors on their two-and-a-half acre farm. \n \nThe enterprise is intensive, with up to three crops per bed, per year. All flowers are soil-based, which enhances flavour and shelf life, and they\u2019re hand picked to order. \n \nHelped by their children, Emma, Jake and Aly, it\u2019s quite the family affair. \n \nThe obvious benefit to their organic approach is the flora and fauna \u2013 more specifically the bee population which Mags said had been decimated in the area. \n \nHuge numbers of bees feed off their crops, which gives the family great pleasure. \n \nMags compares their growing ethos to the slow food movement \u2013 which ironically had a slow take-up - and urges people to be as concerned about the provenance of flowers as they are with food. \n \n\u2018Why put beautiful food on the table, and nasty flowers beside them?\u2019 she asks. \n \nOf course she\u2019s realistic enough to know organic flowers won\u2019t replace other options, but she appeals to people not to compost their blooms in their food bins because of \u2018chemical nasties.\u2019 \n \nBumblebee Flower Farm, under Nowen Hill, takes group bookings for tours. Regardless of the time of year you visit, there\u2019s plenty to interest.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 33 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200179093","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She is the only candidate from the eastern Africa region. \n \nIf she lands the post, she will be the first person from the region to head the AU secretariat since it was established in 2002 and only the second East African chair in the history of the pan-African body initially known as the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). \n \nMr Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania was the Secretary-General (equivalent to the chairperson of the AUC) of the OAU from 1989 to 2001. \nBut Ms Mohamed has to beat Botswana\u2019s Pelonomi Venson Moitoi, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Agapito Mba Mokuy , Chad\u2019s Moussa Faki Mahamat and Senegal\u2019s Abdoulaye Bathily. \n \nDr Moitoi, the current Foreign Minister of Botswana won the Kigali poll in July, but failed to garner two-thirds of votes cast. \n \nOTHER CANDIDATES \n \nMr Mokuy and Uganda\u2019s Specioza Kazibwe were the other candidates in that election. The Ugandan later withdrew from the race. \n \nNormally, the chairperson of the AUC is the Chief Executive Officer of the African Union. \n \nThe chairperson is the chief accountant of the bloc and acts as the spokesperson of the organisation in relating with other bodies like the United Nations. \n \nSo how do they get elected? By law, candidates must have filed their notice of candidature at least three months before the due date. In this case, all the five registered their applications before October 30 last year. \n \nThe idea is for the AU secretariat based in Addis Ababa to circulate their names among member states. It acts as a pitch for the candidates who must then campaign across the member states, seeking as much support as possible. \nThe AU will also be electing eight commissioners who will be departmental heads of various sectors of the AU. \n \nThese are elected by foreign ministers of member states, known as the AU Executive Council, before they are endorsed by the Assembly of heads of state and government. Here, the candidates and their representatives lobby for support and make compromises or trade-offs. \n \nFIRST ROUND \n \nEach of the candidates has been targeting at least 11 votes in the first round of voting. \n \nThe person who gets the least votes in the first round must drop of the race and this has a bearing on the swing vote in round two of voting. \n \nThis means that long before voting day on Monday, all the candidates can gauge their strength. Some may even pull out before the ballot is cast. \n \nAccording to Rule 38 of the Rules of Procedure, all AU elections must be done by secret ballot; the exception is in electing the ceremonial chairperson of the Assembly where consensus is used. \n \nThe heads of state and government or their verified representatives cast a vote each. \n \nThis privilege is not available to member states under sanctions for coming to power via coup, refusing to service membership dues or declining to abide by previous substantial AU decisions. \n \nThe elections start with votes for the chairperson and deputy. Both the chairperson of the AUC and the deputy are declared after garnering two-thirds of the votes. \n \nThere can be several rounds of voting until the winner is found. \n \nIn the last election, Jean Ping of Gabon and Dr Dlamini-Zuma battled for three rounds of voting. \n \nBEST TWO \n \nIf the third round remains inconclusive, the subsequent election is restricted to the best two candidates. This creates further swing votes. These two can then battle for three more rounds. If no one gets majority votes here, the losing candidate is compelled to withdraw from the race. \n \nBut the commission can postpone elections to another day. The Assembly will also appoint eight commissioners elected by the Executive Council based on \u201cgeographical distribution,\u201d according to the Rules of Procedure. \n \nThis means that regions; east, west, central, south and north, which produce chairperson or deputy chairperson can only have one commissioner each. The rest can have two, but the chairperson and the deputy cannot come from the same region. \n \nIn this race, various candidates are vying to be deputy chairperson. They include Djibouti\u2019s Interior Minister Yacin Elmi Bouh who will battle it out with Thomas Kwesi Quartey from Ghana, Mr Claude Joachim Tiker from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Abdulhakim Rajab Elwaer of Libya. \n \nTheir fate is directly attached to the performance of the candidate for the chairperson, especially since the AU votes for the chairperson first. \n \nOther candidates for the influential positions include the Commissioner for Peace and Security and the Commissioner for Political Affairs. \n \nFACCING COMPETITION \n \nAlgeria\u2019s Smail Chergui is seeking to defend his seat as Commissioner for Peace and Security. \n \nBut the Algerian is facing competition from Burundi\u2019s Ephiphanie Kabushemeye who currently serves as the African Union Mission to Somalia civilian Chief of Staff. \n \nOther candidates include Mr Geoffrey L Mvla and Ms Rose Tujilane Chizumila (who are both Malawians), Ms Fatima Kyari Mohammed of Nigeria and Ms Diye Ba of Mauritania, a former minister. \n \nDjibouti\u2019s Hawa Ahmed Youssouf is seeking the Political Affairs commissioner post but she must beat Ms Minata Samaté Cessouma from Burkina Faso and Mr Churchill Ewumbue Monono from Cameroon. \n \nMeanwhile, President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday chaired the 26th African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) Forum where he said Africa should take pride in the progress it has achieved in promoting good governance. \nThe President said despite the existing challenges, there was so much to celebrate in terms of improved governance and rapid development especially in countries that are participating in the APRM forum. \n \nHe cited the mega infrastructure projects going on in different parts of the continent as one of the easiest routes to Africa\u2019s integration. \n \n\u201cVarious APRM member states continue to implement mega infrastructural projects with a regional and even continental dimension. These programs are a critical part of our regional integration agenda,\u201d said the President when he opened the APRM forum at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The President fingered the Lamu Port South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport corridor, which when completed will link up to West Africa\u2019s Douala\u2013Lagos\u2013Cotonou\u2013Abidjan Corridor, running through Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Côte d\u2019Ivoire respectively. \n \n\nSunday January 29, 2017 \n  Wararka iyo Barnaamijyada Radio Kulmiye si aad u dhageysato garaac  USA: 0016054755246 / 0017124329566  Switzerland: 0041445133004  UK: 00443309981135  Sweden: 0046812410569  Belgium: 003223","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Radio kulmiye"},"topics":[],"title":"African Union to hold election to determine next chairperson","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"SO","country":"Somalia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"RadioKulmiye.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597898610","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"RadioKulmiye.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://radiokulmiye.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200182885","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.hiiraan.com/images/logo/DailyNation.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Travelers, refugees from 7 Muslim-majority nations targeted by president\u2019s order \n \nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York issued the emergency order after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n \nThe judge\u2019s order affected only a portion of Trump\u2019s executive action. As the decision was announced, cheers broke out in crowds of demonstrators who had gathered at American airports and outside the Brooklyn courthouse where the ruling was issued. \n \nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n \nIt was unclear how quickly the judge\u2019s order might affect people in detention, or whether it would allow others to resume flying. \n \n\u201cRealistically, we don\u2019t even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes,\u201d said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt. \u201cThis order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nUnder Trump\u2019s order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \u201cgreen cards\u201d or other visas. However, an official with the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday night that no green-card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump\u2019s order had been prevented from entering the U.S. \n \nSome foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday had been detained at U.S. airports, told they were no longer welcome. The DHS official who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas. \n \nIn her three-page order, Donnelly wrote that without the stay \u201cthere will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders and other individuals from nations subject to the Jan. 27, 2017, executive order.\u201d \n \nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from coming to the U.S. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. \n \nTrump\u2019s order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \nThe directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the Sept. 11 hijackers. \n \nAs a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the U.S., then said he would implement \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for people from countries with significant terror concerns. He told reporters Saturday the order is \u201cnot a Muslim ban.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely,\u201d Trump said of the implementation of his order. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u201d \n \nThe order sparked protests at several of the nation\u2019s international airports, including New York\u2019s Kennedy and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and facilities in Minneapolis and Dallas-Forth Worth. In San Francisco, hundreds blocked the street outside the arrival area of the international terminal. Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \u201cPortland Coffee Is From Yemen\u201d and chanting anti-Trump slogans. \n \nU.S. lawmakers and officials around the globe also criticized the move. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said while Trump is right to focus on border security, the order is \u201ctoo broad.\u201d \n \n\u201cIf we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cOur generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\u201d \n \nIn Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would stop issuing new visas to U.S. citizens in response to Trump\u2019s ban, but that anyone already with a visa to Iran wouldn\u2019t be turned away. \n \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter Saturday afternoon to say that refugees were welcome in Canada, \u201cregardless of your faith.\u201d \n \nTwo of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the U.S. military. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York\u2019s Kennedy airport Friday night. Both had been released by Saturday night after their lawyers intervened. \n \nThe government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied. \n \nDiplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump\u2019s order would still be allowed into the U.S. \n \nThose already in the U.S. with a visa or green card would be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump\u2019s order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nTrump\u2019s order also directed U.S. officials to review information as needed to fully vet foreigners asking to come to the U.S. and draft a list of countries that don\u2019t provide that information. That left open the possibility that citizens of other countries could also face a travel ban. \n \nThe U.S. may still admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government would continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \u201cprovided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country.\u201d \n \nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s order. \n \n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d said Lena F. Masri, the group\u2019s national litigation director. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n \nJohn Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations, said the order didn\u2019t address America\u2019s \u201cprimary terrorism-related threat\u201d \u2014 people already in the U.S. who become inspired by what they see on the internet. \n \nTrump\u2019s order drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program, particularly for those from Syria. \n \n\u201cWe are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us,\u201d House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said in a statement Friday. \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.\u201d \n \nIt is unclear how many people would be immediately impacted by the non-refugee travel ban. According to the statistics maintained by the Homeland Security Department, about 17,000 students from the seven designated countries were allowed into the U.S. for the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015 more than 86,000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. on other, non-immigrant visas and more than 52,000 others became legal permanent residents. \n \nLast year the U.S. resettled 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice, including more than 12,000 Syrians. Before leaving office President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would accept 110,000 refugees in the coming year, but Trump\u2019s order cut that by more than half to 50,000. \n \nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville and Eric Tucker in Washington, Ellen Knickmeyer in San Francisco, Jeff Karoub in Detroit, and Karen Matthews, Rachel Zoll, Verena Dobnik and William Mathis in New York contributed to this report. \n\n \nSource: AP \n  Wararka iyo Barnaamijyada Radio Kulmiye si aad u dhageysato garaac  USA: 0016054755246 / 0017124329566  Switzerland: 0041445133004  UK: 00443309981135  Sweden: 0046812410569  Belgium: 003223","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Radio kulmiye"},"topics":[],"title":"U.S. judge bars deportations under Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"SO","country":"Somalia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"RadioKulmiye.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597898610","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"RadioKulmiye.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://radiokulmiye.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200183228","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:41:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

shape is the richest in US history, but has little political experience Not since the last series of Celebrity Apprentice two years ago has Donald Trump\u2019s hiring drawn quite so much attention.\n\nThe former reality television star has had to deal with the reality of moving into the Oval Office with the most skeletal presidential administration in decades. More than 4,000 political appointees are required to fill out an administration and about 1,200 require confirmation by the Senate. He is nowhere near reaching those figures in his first week.\n\nAt the top of the presidential pyramid is Trump\u2019s inner circle of cabinet nominees and White House staff. They are a mix of wealthy outsiders from business, insiders from the Republican ranks, die-hard conservatives and former generals who were critical of Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nThe most important appointees to be signed off by the Senate are Trump\u2019s 21-strong cabinet. So far, just three have been confirmed.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Nikki Haley as the next US ambassador to the United Nations on a vote of 96 to four. The two-term South Carolina governor has little foreign policy experience but she was sufficiently impressive in her meetings with senators, both privately and under the glare of the cameras in the committee rooms, that she sailed through the confirmation process.\n\nWithin hours of being inaugurated, Trump signed off on two retired generals to cabinet roles: James Mattis as defence secretary and John Kelly as homeland security. Kansas congressman and West Point graduate Mike Pompeo was confirmed as CIA director, though this job is not considered a cabinet-level role, according to the Centre for Presidential Transition.\n\nSeven days into Trump\u2019s administration and just three cabinet picks; it is the slowest start of any president in modern political history. On their first days in office in 2001 and 2009 respectively, the Senate confirmed seven of George W Bush and Obama\u2019s nominees. Trump, already behind schedule after his surprise victory, lagged behind badly in terms of vetting his own nominees. His choice of wealthy business figures complicated matters as they went through the security and ethics vetting process. The delay is in part political too. Democrats are taking revenge on Republicans over their refusal to vote on Obama\u2019s last supreme court pick, Merrick Garland, and for applying the congressional brakes to other cabinet appointments during the last president\u2019s years in office.\n\n\"What goes around comes around,\" Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein of California told Politico last month.\n\nDemocrats, still smarting from Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss and fearful of Trump\u2019s plan to roll back the key legislative wins and executive actions of the Obama presidency, have been dragging their heels and scrutinising his cabinet picks even closer than normal and seeking more time for debate.\n\nThey can use parliamentary tactics to stall cabinet confirmations and force Republicans through hoops, though ultimately Trump\u2019s party has the votes to confirm his cabinet if they do not hobble themselves during the hearings. Wealthy philanthropist Betsy DeVos for education, US congressman Tom Price for health and Scott Pruitt for the Environmental Protection Agency are enduring a tough ride.\n\nTrump may have campaigned as the \"blue-collar billionaire\" and a champion of the angry masses with an anti-establishment message, but his cabinet could not be more different from the working and middle class voters of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that propelled his rise.\n\n\"If there was ever a group of cabinet nominees that cry out for rigorous scrutiny, it\u2019s this one,\" the Democratic minority leader, senator Chuck Schumer of New York, said last week.\n\n\"The president\u2019s cabinet is a swamp cabinet full of billionaires and bankers that have conflicts of interest and ethical lapses as far as the eye can see.\"\n\nTrump has amassed a cabinet and inner circle that is the richest in US history. Their combined fortunes are estimated to be worth $14 billion (\u20ac13 billion), according to CBS News.\n\nDeVos comes from a family worth more than $5 billion; the commerce secretary nominee, investor Wilbur Ross, is worth $2.5 billion; wrestling mogul Linda McMahon has a family fortune of $1.2 billion. Despite ripping into Clinton for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs, two of Trump\u2019s team are former executives of the bank, Steve Mnuchin and Steve Bannon.\n\n\"You don\u2019t appoint a cabinet of billionaires to be taking on the establishment,\" senator Bernie Sanders, runner-up to Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said last month.\n\nThere are just three women in the cabinet and minorities are poorly represented. Ben Carson, nominated for the department of housing and urban development, is the only African American. Elaine Chao, for transportation, and Haley are the only Asian-Americans and, for the first time since the 1980s, there is no Hispanic cabinet member.\n\nNine cabinet members have previously held elective office. Three more have previously served in government, but only one, Chao, has experience running a full department. Seven come from the private sector and have no experience of serving in public office.\n\nThat matters little to Trump, who believes he has done his best hiring to date. \"We have by far the highest IQ of any cabinet ever assembled,\" he said the day before his inauguration.\n\nIf you are viewing this story on our app follow this link: http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/1.2953784\n\nDonald Trump's new cabinet Nominations to cabinet or cabinet level Mike Pence Vice-president\n\nFormer governor of Indiana \n\nDescribing himself as a \"Christian, a conservative and a Republican \u2013 in that order\", Pence was the ideal choice of running mate for the brash, thrice-married property mogul and television celebrity from Manhattan. An anti-abortion advocate and opponent of gay rights, the former talk show host and US congresssman was embraced by conservative Republicans when he was picked. He used his connections on Capitol Hill and beyond to help build Trump\u2019s team after his election victory. Rex Tillerson \n\nSecretary of state\n\nFormer chief executive, Exxon Mobil \n\nTillerson (64), the Texas oilman and lifer at the world\u2019s largest publicly quoted oil company, was a wildcard pick to be America\u2019s top diplomat. Known for his close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin through his business dealings, he was criticised by Republican senator Marco Rubio for refusing to call Putin a \"war criminal\" over Russia\u2019s air strikes in Syria.\n\nRick Perry \n\nSecretary of energy\n\nFormer Texas governor, former Texas agriculture commissioner, two-time presidential candidate \n\nPerry (66) was the longest serving governor of Texas, holding office from 2000 to 2015. During a debate in his 2012 run for the presidency he forgot the name of a department he promised to abolish as president in his famous \"oops\" gaffe. It was the department of energy. During his confirmation hearing, Perry, an oil industry supporter and a contestant on the 2016 series of Dancing with the Stars, said he regretted recommending its abolition.\n\nRyan Zinke \n\nSecretary of interior\n\nUS congressman from Montana, former Navy SEAL \n\nThe 55-year-old one-term Republican congressman served as a Navy SEAL from 1986 to 2008. He was an early supporter of Trump, endorsing him in May, and is one of four military veterans in his cabinet. As secretary of the interior, he would oversee more than 20 per cent of US federal land including the national parks of Yosemite and Yellowstone.\n\nJames Mattis* \n\nSecretary of defence\n\nRetired US marine general, former commander of US central command \n\nThe highly regarded military man, revered by fellow marines, was nicknamed \"Mad Dog\" by the press for making remarks such as \"a good soldier follows orders but a true warrior wears his enemy\u2019s skin like a poncho\". Former military personnel must take a seven-year break from active duty before leading the Pentagon, but just after he was inaugurated Trump signed a waiver that allowed Mattis (66), who retired from the military three years ago, to take up his post.\n\nSteven Mnuchin \n\nSecretary of treasury\n\nTrump campaign finance chairman, former Goldman Sachs executive, Hollywood producer \n\nA 17-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, and hedge fund manager, who was national finance chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign. The New Yorker (54) drew fire from senators during his confirmation hearing for aggressively foreclosing on homeowners who had borrowed from residential lender Indymac, the firm he bought after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. He has helped finance more than 100 Hollywood movies including hits Avatar, American Sniper and the X-Men movies.\n\nJeff Sessions \n\nAttorney general\n\nSenator, Alabama \n\nJefferson Beauregard Sessions III (70) has served as a US senator for Alabama since 1997. In Congress, Sessions, who is of Scots-Irish and English heritage, is known as an anti-immigration hardliner. Three decades ago, he was denied a federal judgeship as a 39-year-old US attorney because of racist remarks he made. He called a black attorney who worked for him \"boy\" and the civil rights groups NAACP and ACLU \"un-American\".\n\nBen Carson \n\nSecretary of housing and urban development\n\nFormer paediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, 2016 presidential candidate \n\nThe 65-year-old retired doctor and author endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential bid in March 2016. He was raised by his mother in an impoverished neighbourhood of Detroit and is the only African-American in the cabinet. Carson, who regularly derides political correctness and government efforts to legislate racial equality, lambasted the government housing agency, which has a budget of $50 billion (¤47 billion), in 2011 when it criticised a city in Iowa for discriminating against black tenants. \"This is what you see in communist countries,\" he said.\n\nWilbur Ross \n\nSecretary of commerce\n\nFormer investment banker, investor in distressed companies \n\nThe New Jersey native (79) made his name and vast fortune turning around failed companies in a range of industries at home and abroad, from steel and coal to telecoms and banking. As a restructuring specialist with Rothschild investment bank, he helped Trump save his Atlantic City casino, the Taj Mahal, from bondholders in 1990. Trump sees Ross, an investor in Bank of Ireland after the property crash, applying his skills to restoring the US manufacturing industry. Tom Price Secretary of health and human services\n\nUS congressman from Georgia, chairman of House budget committee, orthopedic surgeon \n\nPrice (62) built a large orthopedics practice in Georgia before becoming a politician. He went on to represent a district covering the Atlanta suburbs for 12 years, climbing the ranks on Capitol Hill to become House budget committee chairman. A vociferous critic of the Obamacare healthcare plan, he was criticised during his confirmation hearing for buying shares in a medical device maker days before introducing legislation that would have benefited the company.\n\nBetsy DeVos \n\nSecretary of education\n\nChampion of charter schools, philanthropist, Republican donor \n\nThe billionaire philanthropist (59) believes in privatising public education. The former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and her family, who own the Amway business, have donated more than $200 million to the party. She was criticised for her shaky grasp of education issues during her confirmation hearing and for suggesting that guns should be allowed in certain schools to deal, for example, with the threat from grizzly bears in Wyoming.\n\nElaine Chao \n\nSecretary of transportation\n\nFormer US labour secretary \n\nChao (63), the Taiwanese-American wife of the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, became the first Asian-American to hold a cabinet position when George W Bush appointed her labour secretary in 2001. She was the only member of his cabinet to serve for his entire presidency. In Trump\u2019s cabinet, she will responsible for shaping one of his signature policy initiatives, a proposed massive investment in the country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nNikki Haley* \n\nUS ambassador to United Nations\n\nGovernor of South Carolina \n\nHaley\u2019s confirmation as Trump\u2019s envoy at the United Nations made her the first Indian-American to serve in the cabinet. The 45-year-old Republican became a household name when, as governor of South Carolina, she supported the removal of the Confederate flag, regarded as a symbol of racism, from the state-house grounds in her home state after the mass shooting at a historic African-American church in Charleston in 2015.\n\nAndrew Puzder \n\nSecretary of labour\n\nChief executive, CKE Restaurants \n\nThe executive behind the Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr fast food chains was hailed as a man with a \"record of fighting for workers\" by Trump, but the 66-year-old who will lead the government department that regulates wages has argued against a higher minimum wage and said that the Obama administration\u2019s expansion of overtime pay diminishes opportunities for workers.\n\nJohn Kelly* \n\nSecretary of homeland security\n\nRetired US marine general, former commander of US southern command \n\nA native of Boston, Kelly (65) was a popular pick to lead the department that oversees border security. He shares views with Trump, clashing with the Obama administration on plans to close the Guantànamo Bay camp and criticising illegal immigration on the US-Mexico border. His son Robert, a marine lieutenant, was killed when he stepped on a land mine in Afghanistan in 2010.\n\nScott Pruitt \n\nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nOklahoma attorney general, former state senator \n\nOne of Trump\u2019s most contentious cabinet picks, Pruitt (48) has repeatedly sued the agency that he has been asked to lead. He has close ties to the fossil fuel industry and has sought to undermine environmental regulations. He has said that there is a \"debate\" about climate change and clashed with senator Bernie Sanders during his confirmation hearing, suggesting that humans may contribute to climate change \"in some manner\" rather than being the cause of climate change.\n\nMick Mulvaney \n\nDirector of office of management and budget\n\nUS congressman from South Carolina \n\nA staunch fiscal conservative and budget hawk, Trump\u2019s pick to run this powerful office in the executive branch of government was a founding member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. The Irish-American politician (49) was elected to represent South Carolina in the US Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010. He faces tough questions at his confirmation hearing over his admission that he did not pay more than $15,000 in taxes for his triplets\u2019 nanny. Linda McMahon Administrator of the Small Business Administration\n\nFormer chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment \n\nMcMahon (68), along with her husband Vincent, became rich from growing their professional wrestling operation from a regional business into an international corporation over 30 years. She left the WWE in 2009 to run unsuccessfully for the US Senate in Connecticut and was a big donor to both Trump\u2019s campaign and his family\u2019s scandal-prone charitable foundation.\n\nRobert Lighthizer \n\nUS trade representative\n\nFormer deputy US trade representative \n\nLighthizer was picked by Trump from a blue-chip Washington law firm in a sign that his administration intends to take a hard line on China. A trade representative during the Reagan years, Lighthizer has accused China of unfair trade practices. His experience in trade litigation and policies for US corporations will help Trump in his plan to negotiate better trade deals.\n\nDavid Shulkin \n\nSecretary of veterans affairs\n\nUnder secretary for health at the department of veterans affairs \n\nShulkin (57), a physician who has 30 years of experience running private hospitals, would be the first veterans affairs secretary who has not served in the military. He was unanimously confirmed for his post as undersecretary in charge of the Veterans Health Administration in June 2015. This should put him in a strong position to be approved for this more senior role at a department plagued by mismanagement and malpractice over the treatment of military veterans.\n\nSonny Perdue \n\nSecretary of agriculture\n\nFormer Georgia governor \n\nPerdue (70) served two terms as governor of Georgia, from 2003 to 2011 and comes to Trump\u2019s cabinet with strong agricultural credentials for his new role running a far-reaching agency with a budget of $150 billion. He grew up on a farm and has several agricultural-related businesses. He has described climate change as a \"running joke\" and the arguments of liberals concerned about the environment as \"ridiculous and so obviously disconnected from reality\".\n\nWhite House appointments Reince Priebus Chief of staff\n\nChairman of Republican National Committee \n\nTrump tapped this top Republican Party apparatchik to bridge the gap between the property mogul\u2019s insurgent camp of outsiders and the party faithful in Congress. Priebus (44), the former Republican national committee chairman, is close to fellow Wisconsin native Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the highest ranking Republican on Capitol Hill. Priebus is seen as an anchor of stability for the Trump ship in the stormy seas ahead.\n\nMichael Flynn \n\nNational security adviser\n\nFormer director of the Defence Intelligence Agency and retired army lieutenant general \n\nFlynn (58) was a senior intelligence official in Iraq and Afghanistan at the height of the US wars. He was fired by President Barack Obama in 2014 over his pugnacious style and during the campaign has played an influential role informing Trump\u2019s world view on the war on \"radical Islamic terrorism\". His ties to Russia have been investigated by the FBI in recent weeks.\n\nStephen Bannon \n\nChief strategist\n\nFormer executive chairman of Breitbart News \n\nBannon (63), another former Goldman Sachs executive in Trump\u2019s inner circle, ran the right-wing Breitbart News website before joining the billionaire\u2019s presidential campaign last summer. This combative operator has been responsible for guiding Trump on his hardline, nationalist and populist message. He has described the mainstream media as \"the opposition party\".\n\nDonald McGahn \n\nWhite House counsel\n\nFormer member of the Federal Election Commission \n\nThe Atlantic City-born campaign finance lawyer (48) was chief counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee and was appointed to the Federal Election Commission in 2008 by George W Bush. He was one of the earliest recruits to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, signing on in early 2015. He will have to navigate difficult legal terrain offering advice to the president on the extent of his executive authority and dealing with potential ethical issues. Kellyanne Conway \n\nCounsellor to the president\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager and senior adviser, pollster \n\nThe former pollster (50) was promoted from senior adviser to be Trump\u2019s campaign manager, his third in 14 months, in August. She is credited for limiting his wayward rants and keeping him on message in the latter stages of the campaign. She became the first woman to lead a winning presidential campaign and was rewarded with a key position within Trump\u2019s White House team.\n\nSean Spicer \n\nPress secretary\n\nFormer chief strategist and communications director, Republican National Committee \n\nSpicer (45) worked with Reince Priebus at the Republican National Committee and both joined Trump\u2019s team after he secured the presidential nomination. In his first official briefing at the White House last Saturday, Spicer, a proud Irish-American whose great-grandfather came from Co Cork, angrily accused the media of \"deliberately false reporting\" on the size of the crowd at the president\u2019s inauguration. He has delivered steadier performances since then and will be the president\u2019s most public defender over the coming four years. *Confirmed

Two unlikely bedfellows join forces to combat a mighty villain. But the Congress party and the Samajwadi Party have two villains\u2013the BJP and the BSP. The opponents are divided but still strong. The SP-Congress alliance may not be the strongest contenders in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, but they are stronger than what they were as individual units. In Bollywood potboilers, the strange bedfellows win in the end and the villains lose. But in politics, there are no villains\u2013just winners and losers. \n \nWho would have thought a few months ago that Samajwadi Party will force its founder president Mulayam Singh Yadav, a shrewd politician, into an early retirement? But the fate had it in store for him. A family feud that he claimed to be resolving dug his political grave and sent him packing into Samajwadi Party\u2019s \u2018margadarshak mandal\u2019. His son Akhilesh Yadav, who unceremoniously dethroned the veteran politician, scampered into an alliance with the Congress party that had no presence in the state and was electorally doomed. There were growling and whimpering in the Samajwadi party ranks but Akhilesh anyway went ahead with the move\u2013his first enormous political gamble that he played without interference by his small council that he exiled as he assumed power in the party. Akhilesh Yadav finally agreed to a 298-105 seat-sharing formula with the Congress after its matriarch Sonia Gandhi\u2019s timely intervention. And here they are campaigning together in Lucknow\u2013a new king and a reluctant prince. \n \nAkhilesh Yadav and Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi hit the campaign trail together for the first time in their political careers. They addressed a press conference together and then showed their solidarity and strength with a road show in the state capital. Posters with the slogan \u2018UP ko yeh saath pasand hai\u2019 having the pictures of both Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav with their party symbols have been also released. The \u2018tri-colour\u2019 and \u2018red and green\u2019 colours of both the parties will form the border of the posters. Only that no one knows for sure will UP likes this marriage or not. \n \nAs of now, things look hunky-dory for the new alliance. The two leaders are campaigning together. Talks are that they would soon be addressing rallies together in the state. The two parties were still haggling over some seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli, the parliamentary turf of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul. But that little glitch will be solved in all likelihood. Akhilesh had recently joined a Congress leader in a rally in Lakhimpur Kheri. His sister-in-law Aparna Yadav told a news channel that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may campaign for her in Lucknow Cantt. It may be possible that Akhilesh\u2019s wife Dimple Yadav\u2014who played a big role in stitching the alliance together\u2014may campaign with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister is confident of at least getting more than 300 seats out of 403. \n \nWhy are they together? \n \n\u201cFor the unity of the country and committed to the idea of secularism, SP and Congress will contest the 2017 polls together. We appeal to the supporters to vote for the candidates of the two parties to take forward the agenda of development started by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav,\u201d Samajwadi Party state president Naresh Uttam had said at a joint press conference with Raj Babbar. \n \nHowever, the real reason is the minority votes. The minorities especially Muslims traditionally vote for both the parties. During negotiations for the alliance, both the parties were squabbling for seats with more minority presence. \n \nThe route of the road show was decided so that it also covered the Muslim-dominated areas besides those which have the concentration of the youth population. Pretty much sums their intention. \n \nTraditionally, Muslim voters have been a big deciding factor in the state. The Muslim voters do not vote for the BJP, so they support either Congress or SP. The Congress-SP alliance intends to keep the vote bank consolidated. \n \nAlso, there are calculations in Akhilesh Yadav\u2019s mind. The party leader is eyeing more than 35 %voteshare to get around 300 seats to retain power. In 2012, SP had got 29.13% votes. The Congress had got 11.65% votes. Together, both the parties can reach the magical figure. \n \n\n \nWhy is this alliance significant even after UP polls? \n \nUttar Pradesh is the biggest state in the country in terms of the Lok Sabha seats. The enormous state has 80 constituencies. In 2014 General Elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party dismantled all the other parties in the state. They had got 71 seats and a whopping vote share 42.30 percent. The party got a landslide victory and went on to form a popular government in Delhi under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The vote percentage of the BJP in the state compared to 2009 was increased by 24%. It was understood later that a Modi wave had come swept away with votes in the states. The Samajwadi Party and the BSP that were the two largest parties in 2009, were destroyed. \n \nSP had 23 seats in 2009, they were reduced to 5 seats in 2014. BSP had 20 seats in 2009, they couldn\u2019t even open their accounts. The Congress party had 26 seats in 2009, they were reduced to a mere 2 seats in the state. \n \n\n \nThe vote shares of the parties didn\u2019t dip much individually. There was 1.06 points dip in SP\u2019s vote share, whereas BSP got 7.82 points lesser votes than in 2009. The Congress party took the biggest hit with a dip pf 10.75 points. \n \nThe main reason for such a performance by BJP was Narendra Modi alone. The charismatic leader mesmerised the voters with his promise of \u2018ache din\u2019. However, things have changed now. Under his leadership, the party lost two major elections\u2013Delhi and Bihar. The two results clearly showed that he was not invincible. The Modi wave has cooled down and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing flak for his demonetisation move and heavy tax regime. The government is also going to undertake a tectonic shift in India\u2019s taxation\u2013the GST. Economists say that it will be a welcome economic reform, but no one is sure about the political implications of the move as most of the services will get more expensive after its implementation. It has the real potential of backfiring to the Modi government electorally. Without the Modi wave, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party together have a big chance of bouncing back in the 2019 general elections. \n \nThere are 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh. In 2009 general elections, the SP had got 23.26% votes and was the single-largest party in the state with 23 seats in their kitty. The Congress had got 21 seats with a vote share of 18.25%. The BJP could only get 10 seats with a vote share 17.50%. If Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi remain together till 2009, they can make a real dent in BJP\u2019s voters base. BJP\u2019s policies at the Centre may have a direct impact in the state. Whereas, people can show their confidence on the refurbished Samajwadi Party under the leadership Akhilesh Yadav, who enjoys a clean and pro-development image. If they contest the 2019 elections together and even repeat their performance in 2009 in the absence of a political wave, they can get a vote share of 35% plus and that is enough to destroy the BJP in the state. A vote share of 40% or more can get them around 50 seats and it can make a major difference nationally. \n \nWhy they can be a big danger to \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Vaibhav Tiwari"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"If Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi succeed in UP Assembly polls 2017, it can prove detrimental to Narendra Modi\u2019s prospects in 2019 Lok Sabha polls","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200192353","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Akhilesh-Rahul.jpg"},{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Akhilesh-Rahul-238x134.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Step back!\" the agents shouted at them.\n\nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over.\n\nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys.\n\nNassauer had no clear answer.\n\n\"We are as much in the dark as everybody else,\" said the border protection official at one of the largest US airports.\n\nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees.\n\nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not.\n\nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at US airports.\n\nReckless\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \"reckless\" to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups.\n\nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines.\n\nAffected travellers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).\n\nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump's executive order banning them.\n\nBut some lawful permanent residents \u2013 those with so-called green cards \u2013 were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel.\n\nAt about 10 pm on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveller reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA.\n\nA senior administration official said Trump's order - aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans.\n\n\"There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official told reporters in a briefing. \"It would be reckless and irresponsible to ... broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you're going to take.\"\n\nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate.\n\n\"I\u2019m not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn\u2019t briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\" the official said.\n\nOut of the loop\n\nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials.\n\nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said.\n\n\"Was there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government\u2019s most complex endeavours, involving seven agencies from the US Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments.\n\nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies - or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them - who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president's order.\n\n\"If the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\" said one of the officials, referring to the White House.\n\nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump's order.\n\nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \u201climited department participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\" the official said.\n\nChaos at airports\n\nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a US Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans.\n\nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with US military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys.\n\nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country.\n\nBut dozens of others were less fortunate.\n\nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order.\n\nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency's communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \"not included\" in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise.\n\nThe Trump administration official later told reporters that US green card holders travelling outside the United States need to check with a US consulate to see whether they can return.\n\n\"It's being cleared on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe green card issue has left immigration attorneys confused about how to advise their clients. Attorney David Leopold, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he is erring on the side of caution, advising his clients to stay in the United States to avoid being stranded abroad.\n\nThat can create some agonizing dilemmas.\n\n\"A Syrian doctor who has a dying mother in Europe cannot go visit her not knowing that he will be able to get back into the United States,\u201d Leopold said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Chaos at airports over Trump ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/world/americas/2017/01/29/how-trump-s-abrupt-immigration-ban-created-confusion-at-airports-agencies&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695200199820","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/29/trump-ban-airport.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Trump+ban+airport.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country.

Federer, 35, and Nadal, 30 are once again at it. Both men, who rouse nostalgia, are in a Major final. The Swiss and the Spaniard will be facing in the Australian Open men\u2019s final on Sunday. It is a tough one to predict. First and foremost, there is not a lot that has separated the two players as far as hard courts are concerned. \n \nWhile Nadal has been clearly the better player on clay, the grass would have favoured Federer\u2019s game. That equation of dominance does not stand with respect to hard courts. No player can claim that he will dominate his great rival and opponent on a hard court because the man at the other side of the net is equally capable on the same surface. \n \nHere are 10 key stats ahead of the big final: \n \n1) Federer has won 17 Majors, Nadal has bagged 14 Majors \n2) Federer will be playing his 28th Major final, Nadal will be in his 21st Major final \n3) Federer is looking for his fifth Australian Open title, Nadal for his second Australian Open crown \n4) This will be Federer\u2019s sixth Australian Open final, it will be Nadal\u2019s fourth \n5) Federer has won more Majors than anyone else, Nadal is tied for the second spot with Pete Sampras \n6) Nadal leads the head-to-head record against Federer at 23-11 \n7) In Majors, Nadal leads Federer 9-2 \n8) In Major finals, Nadal leads Federer 6-2 \n9) At the Australian Open, Nadal leads Federer 3-0 \n10) Both have contested at an Australian Open final only once before. It was in 2009 when Nadal won 7\u20135, 3\u20136, 7\u20136 (7\u20133), 3\u20136, 6\u20132 \n \nNadal leads Federer 13-2 on clay. More importantly, Nadal has won the French Open nine times. Federer has won in France only once. On grass, the two have met only three times. Federer leads 2-1. And significantly, Federer has won Wimbledon seven times. Nadal on the other hand has won there twice. \n \nOn hard courts, it is really close with Nadal leading Federer 9-7. On the other hand, Federer has won nine Majors on hard courts (five in the US and four in Australia). Nadal has bagged three Majors on hard courts (two in the US and one in Australia). \n \nBoth have not played a Major final in six years. They last played at the French Open in 2011 when Nadal won 7\u20135, 7\u20136 (7\u20133), 5\u20137, 6\u20131.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017, Live updates: Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal, Men's singles final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200205332","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without doubt, Betsy DeVos is embarrassingly unprepared and already an active threat to public education. She is an activist opponent of public schools, like other extreme libertarians including the Koch brothers, and has spent years and tons of money toward weakening public education in Michigan by promoting the growth of unregulated, un-scrutinized public charter schools and a yet unrealized voucher system to benefit private schools, both secular and religious. \n \nShe and her multi-billionaire family have successfully used their moneyed influence to cause significant drain of vital funds from an already acutely distressed system into a plethora of, for the most part, alarmingly under-performing charter schools. Most rank well below Michigan\u2018s and the nation\u2018s achievement profiles. \n \nShe\u2019s not an educator and her children have never attended public school. She\u2019s essentially a super-wealthy lobbyist who has used her money for out-sized influence to bend public officialdom to her vision \u2014 which, wherever realized, shows a pattern of dismal failure. Her nomination may well be due to the over $200 million her family has contributed to conservative candidates, including Trump, and conservative causes. It\u2019s otherwise inexplicable that one with such a record and so ignorant of educational philosophy, issues and policy would be offered oversight of our children\u2019s education. \n \nI\u2019m a fierce supporter of public education and question any innovation that by its nature will siphon already inadequate funding from public schools. Obviously schools in many situations are desperate for solutions, and it\u2019s undeniable that the charter school movement has produced some exemplary institutions. \n \nFor the most part, though, public charter schools have failed to deliver. They are not subject to the regulations by which public education is scrutinized, and the charter system is ripe for shysterism looking to gain access to that enticing pool of public funds. \n \nWhether good or bad, they all drain funding from the public schools whose overhead remains the same, regardless of how many students take their per child allotment to what may be no more than a poorly equipped storefront. Most charters impose limits on who may enroll, whereas the public school does not, which significantly distorts outcomes. \n \nDeVos\u2019s championing of vouchers for private secular and religious schools is the same slippery slope a recent Community Voices contributor described in her column on the true conservative intent to phase out Medicare as a publicly managed system while still receiving public funding. \n \nA voucher system to allow parents to apply their child\u2019s per child allotment to the cost of private secular or parochial schools is touted as \u201cparental choice,\u201d but is in reality an insidious path to dismantling the public school system and in the process eliminating for most people whatever choice there may once have been. (Many Tennessee lawmakers favor a voucher system, probably because they love peppering their speeches with \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cchoice,\u201d but I doubt if many have bothered to think past the pandering to the inevitable outcome.) \n \nDeVos is a deeply religious evangelical who wants to channel public monies, via vouchers, to church-run schools which educate according to their particular belief systems, in defiance of our founding fathers\u2019 wisdom regarding the separation of church and state. I find no fault with parochial schools and the function they serve but, if that\u2019s their choice for their children, they should not covet or lobby for or welcome public funding. \n \nIf the conservative voucher strategy to phase out public education ever becomes reality, in short time middle and low-income families will come to realize that the only \u201cchoice\u201d they ever really had was the choice to abandon the only system that was obligated to serve their child, regardless of need, for free. The wealthy who can afford private schools will find their costs lowered by vouchers while the middle and lower classes find their per-child-allotment vouchers woefully inadequate to cover cost. \n \nPrivatization of public services is, first, profit driven with service somewhere down the scale, and without regulatory protections always subject to cost increases. This sends my imagination into a bizarre future landscape where lottery scholarships and Pell Grants have followed the need downward to kindergarten. \n \nThe best schools in the world are free public schools, originally based on our model. Yet we\u2019ve managed to fall well short of what could and should have been our finest achievement. The quality and equality of its schools reflects any citizenry\u2019s values and the fact that we already allow gross inequities throughout our system is a poor reflection of ours. \n \nEntrusting our children\u2019s futures to such a one as DeVos can only frustrate our quest for solutions. \n \nJennie Young of Elizabethton is a retired language arts teacher.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"DeVos seeks to destroy public education","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"37605","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Johnson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Johnson City Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169732646","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"612"},"name":"Johnson City Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.johnsoncitypress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200205732","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It really feels great,\" Serena said. \n \n\"I've been chasing it for a really long time. It feels like a really long time. When it got on my radar, I knew I had an opportunity to get there, and I'm here. I'm here. It's a great feeling. \n \n\"There's no better place to do it than Melbourne.

I just feel like it was the right moment. Everything kind of happened. It hasn't quite set in yet, but it's really good\". \n \nCourt was watching on in the crowd as Serena proved too consistent and too clinical for her older sibling, who was playing her first grand slam final since Wimbledon in 2009. \n \nAs well as pocketing the champion's cheque of 3,700,000 Australian dollars, Serena will reclaim the number one ranking, moving above Germany's Angelique Kerber when the list refreshes on Monday. \n \nThe 35-year-old also extends her own record as the oldest female grand slam champion in the Open era and has widened the gap on both Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who retired with 18 major victories. \n \nOn being called the greatest to have ever played the game, Serena said: \"Between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation. \n \n\"There's just one thing about a champion, they keep fighting, they keep going. I just feel like those four really are incredible fighters. They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going.\" \n \nShe insists, however, she is not now focused on surpassing Court's tally. \n \n\"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it,\" Serena said. \"That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax. \n \n\"If you win the French, it's like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. In Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next grand slam.\" \n \nVenus has now lost 17 times in 28 career meetings with Serena and been defeated by her sister in seven out of nine major finals. \n \nThe seven-time grand slam champion has still never lifted the title in Melbourne. \n \n\"It's not weird because I guess I've been here before,\" Venus said. \"I really enjoy seeing the name 'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing. \n \n\"Twenty-three is a great number. I know she would like to have a little more. Who wouldn't?

He will soon be confirmed by the state Senate as a member of the governing board Gov. Bill Haslam has created for East Tennessee State University. And as Press staff writer Zack Vance reported last week, Ramsey said there \u201care several groups that have asked me to come on board with them for a salaried position to help consult, so I could help get these things I think the state of Tennessee needs through the legislature.\u201d \n \nConsult? Does that mean he will be lobbying his former colleagues in the state General Assembly on behalf of these interests? \n \nRestrictions on lobbying, as outlined in Tennessee Code Annotated 3-6-304, say: \u201cNo member of the General Assembly, elected official in the executive branch, member of the governor\u2019s cabinet, or cabinet level staff within the governor\u2019s office shall be a lobbyist during the twelve-month period immediately following departure from such office or employment.\u201d \n \nSo that means Ramsey will have to wait a year to become a true lobbyist. If and when he does, he is required by state law to register officially as a lobbyist. \n \n\u2022 The governor\u2019s plan to raise the state\u2019s fuel tax by 7 cents for gasoline and 12 cents for diesel hasn\u2019t exactly been met with cheers by either state lawmakers or state residents. Haslam said a failure to hike the tax will place much-needed road and bridge projects on hold for a decade or more. \n \nNonetheless, legislators and their constituents are not convinced a hike to the tax (which hasn\u2019t been raised since 1989) is needed when the state is enjoying a $1.8 billion budget surplus. Many are asking: Why not use that money to shore up the state\u2019s depleted transportation fund? \n \nThe reason is the surplus has been designated as a \u201crainy day\u201d fund. Tennessee is a state that relies heavily on sales taxes, and two or more consecutive quarters of bad sales tax collections could easily wipe that surplus out. And while $1.8 billion would certainly help get some stalled road construction projects back on track, dipping into the rainy day fund is far from being a long-term solution. \n \n\u2022 State Rep. Sheila Butt, R-Columbia, has withdrawn a bill that would have prevented poor Tennesseans from using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u201cto purchase food items that are high in calories, sugar and fat without any nutritional value, including, but not limited to, soda, ice cream, candy, cookies and cake.\u201d \n \nButt told reporters in Nashville that the meddling Feds would probably frown on any such state regulation. Really? Even with the regulations-hating Trump administration in charge? \n \nThe bill could be seen as another one of those headline-grabbing bills GOP lawmakers sponsor every year. The idea of promoting the purchase of healthy foods is noble, but only if such foods (like organics) could be made easily available and more affordable in all neighborhoods.
