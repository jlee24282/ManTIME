But there are certain things Thibodeau wants to see from his bench, whether or not the shots are falling. Especially on offense. \n \n\u201cThe ball movement, that\u2019s important,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cKris [Dunn] can get pressure on the rim with his penetration.\u201d \n \nTo Thibodeau, getting the ball into the paint is important, whether it is with a post-up or with dribble penetration. \n \n\u201cI think the utilization of the pick-and-roll is important, particularly with [Nemanja] Bjelica because he can shoot and put it on the floor and make the play,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we want to be balanced. With the second unit, Zach [LaVine] gets in there and gives us a nice catch-and-shoot game.\u2019\u2019 \n \nLong-range struggles \n \nBut to get that balance the Wolves reserves have to hit the open three-pointer. LaVine, who often plays with that group, has showed signs of breaking out of a short shooting slump. But Bjelica has struggled of late with three-pointers. Bjelica is 7-for-36 (19.4 percent) on threes in January. \n \n\u201cHe has to keep shooting them,\u2019\u2019 Thibodeau said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good shooter. As long as he\u2019s open, we want him to shoot. That\u2019s what keeps a defense honest. We have the belief he\u2019s going to make them.\u201d \n \nBjelica stayed on the court taking extra shots long after the team\u2019s morning shoot-around. \n \nSchedule adjustment \n \nPerhaps you\u2019re wondering why Saturday\u2019s Wolves game tipped off at 8 p.m., when the normal start time for Wolves home games is 7 p.m.? \n \nThree letters: ABC. \n \nABC televised Saturday\u2019s Clippers-Golden State game, with a 7:30 p.m. start, nationwide. As an accommodation to that, the Wolves scheduled an 8 p.m. start of their game so as not to interfere with the national broadcast. This isn\u2019t the only time this season it will happen, either. The Wolves\u2019 home game with Memphis next Saturday will start at 8 p.m. as well, as will road games at Houston Feb. 25 and at San Antonio March 4. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge of our league, the readiness to play,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cYou have all different situations to deal with: back-to-backs, four in five, early start, late start. Whenever you got to go, you got to go.\u201d \n \nTowns Sr. has MRI \n \nKarl-Anthony Towns said his father, Karl, whose right knee was injured during the Wolves\u2019 game with Indiana Thursday, had an MRI on his knee but hasn\u2019t gotten the results yet. The elder Towns incurred the injury when, during a timeout, the team mascot slid down the stairs on a sled. It appeared the sled hit a chair, which hit Towns\u2019 knee. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it happened,\u201d Towns said. \u201cI just remember looking up and seeing Crunch about to start to sled.\u201d Karl Towns Sr. is still on crutches, his son said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Wolves bench sees fewest minutes in NBA, limiting its offensive output","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anoka","zipCode":"55432","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Minneapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663279","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11345"},"name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.startribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200676566","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We have a break for cookies and coffee on practice nights, once a week. I have made homemade cookies for our break for more than 25 years. \n \nIn May, we have an outdoor concert. I have brought cookies each year for after our performance. This year one of the newer band members asked me if I had \u201crat poison\u201d in them! \n \nI was shocked and asked him to repeat what he said to make sure I heard correctly! His response, \u201cIt was just a joke.\u201d I don\u2019t understand this type of humor. I have continued to make cookies for the band, but I think about his comment each week. \n  \nRelated Articles January 27, 2017   Ask Amy: Friend in abusive relationship faces estrangement   January 26, 2017   Ask Amy: Regular customer thanks the wrong \u201csir\u201d   January 24, 2017   Ask Amy: Daughter ponders not inviting mother to her wedding   January 23, 2017   Ask Amy: Adult daughter wants birth parents to re-adopt her   January 22, 2017   Ask Amy: Husband sends marriage to the dogs   Shall I continue to make cookies for our breaks in 2017? \n \n\u2014 Shocked on the West Coast \n \nDear Shocked: People sometimes make awkward and, unfortunately, unkind comments, because another person\u2019s generosity makes them uncomfortable. \n \nThis person immediately tried to reassure you that he was making a \u201cjoke.\u201d This comment was not funny in any context, so it can\u2019t be characterized as a joke, but I hope you will forgive his graceless reaction to you. \n \nI raise a toast to all of the generous bakers who bring in treats to share with others. It is a very kind, sweet and generous impulse, and sharing these treats helps to bring others together. Don\u2019t let this person\u2019s sarcasm ruin this sweetness for you \u2014 or the rest of your ensemble. \n \nDear Amy: Is there a polite way to respond when you are in a room with someone who has \u2014 or is getting over \u2014 a cold, who coughs or sneezes all over the place without bothering to cover up? \n \nI\u2019ve gotten sick twice this winter and both times it was a day or two after being around someone who is too inconsiderate to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze. I know I can\u2019t be sure that the colds came from these people, but I\u2019m betting they were the cause. \n \nI travel to people\u2019s homes for my job and usually spend two to three hours there, so when I am sick, I reschedule to prevent spreading anything. \n  \nI don\u2019t want to be a jerk. But at the same time, rescheduling an appointment costs me a few hundred dollars. \n \nDo you have any suggestions on how to get my message across politely? \n \n\u2014 Worried \n \nDear Worried: It is common courtesy to cover one\u2019s mouth when coughing or sneezing; school children are now taught to cover their mouths with the inside of their elbows, instead of their hands, which may help prevent spreading illness. \n \nIf you are in a room with someone who appears to be sick and is not covering their mouth, you should simply respond, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you seem sick. Would you mind covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze? I seem to catch everything, and I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d \n \nObviously, you should make sure you keep up with your own hand-washing hygiene. This will help to protect your clients. \n \nDear Amy: \u201cConcerned Sister\u201d was relating an issue where the sister-in-law wants to use her surname for the third child (the other two children have the husband\u2019s surname). You say that, \u201cRarely, families choose to divide the spouses\u2019 surnames between children; and this can cause paperwork hassles and some issues when traveling as a family \u2026 .\u201d \n \nTwenty-one years ago, my wife and I flipped a coin that determined that our oldest daughter took her last name. Seventeen years ago, our next daughter took my last name. \n \nWe expected bureaucratic hassles and snide comments. My mother asked me whether the girls were going to be confused about who their father really was. \n \nI can truly say, with great surprise, that we had no problems navigating this. Everybody who mattered knew who was related to whom at every step of the way, including during foreign travel. I cannot recall a single issue we had that lasted longer than 10 seconds of pleasant conversation, nor any extra form that we needed to fill out. \n \nI do appreciate your first piece of advice on this: this is the parents\u2019 issue, not an issue for the in-laws, cousins and grandparents. \n \n\u2014 John D. Faucher \n \nDear John: I have encountered minor challenges as a parent traveling with a minor child with a different surname (one border guard queried her to determine if I was really her mother \u2014 completely understandable).

When you are relaxed, the recall value will be more.  A happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet. When you are tensed, knowledge takes a back seat. Do not let that happen.  Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. Important to study for knowledge.

Additionally, Shackelford said he spends upward of $5,000 of his own money on Christmas for the children. \n \nBeginnings \nA remote village in Cambodia became the site of Anyway Foundation\u2019s first school in 2005, the result of a story that began in the late-60s.After being drafted into the US military at the age of 25 \u2013 during the Vietnam War, Shackelford eventually worked on the border of Cambodia and Vietnam to assist with a village. \n\u201cIt was the best job I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d recalled Shackelford. \nWhile working in the US military, his team was given 87 families in a poor, remote village. \n\u201cWe created roads and paths and designed houses with their [the villagers\u2019] help,\u201d he said. \nUltimately, 87 houses were built and during the construction, the school, church and temple were all added on to. \n\u201cMy mother even got school supplies,\u201d said Shackelford of his schoolteacher mother. \u201cIt was a big addition to this little area.\u201d \nFollowing his service, Shackleford did not return to Vietnam until the mid-90s, where he met and quickly befriended Chan Kem Lang, a Cambodian bicycle driver. \nShackleford would go on to assist Lang \u2013 whose nickname was \u201cElephant\u201d \u2013 upgrade to a motorbike and eventually to a car and complete both high school and college. \n\u201cI went to his village and saw how poor it was,\u201d said Shackleford, \u201cElephant was the only person who ever went to school.\u201d \nAnd in 2005, his village finally had built a school. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason I do things there,\u201d said Shackleford, \u201cI trust Elephant.\u201d \nIn another part of Cambodia, Anyway Foundation built an orphanage. \n\u201cWhen we started the orphanage, we had 19 babies all on formula,\u201d said Shackleford, \u201cBut we had one nanny for every two children.\u201d \nThe youngest of the original group is now six years old and, according to Shackleford, 27 children, to date, have been adopted \u2013 all to European countries. \nWhen asked where his philanthropic mindset comes from, Shackleford reminisced about his childhood. \n\u201cIt goes back to my Methodist upbringing and my mother,\u201d he said, \u201cBeginning in first grade, she would take me to go to migrant camps in Hillsboro to buy things to help.\u201d \nWhen he isn\u2019t spending time in Cambodia or the Philippines, Shackleford travels for pleasure and often seeks out countries in need of help in some kind. He has assisted humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Katrina, in Haiti and Chile after earthquakes. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t help everyone,\u201d he added, \u201cBut you can help everyone you meet.\u201d \n \nWinery \nResponsible for Anyway Foundation\u2019s early success in Shackleford\u2019s philanthropy has the Nehalem Bay Winery to thank. \nShackleford, the world traveler, has been to 152 different countries and territories and spends anywhere between 50 to 70 days in the United States during any given calendar year. \nA Shackleford sighting in Nehalem is rare, indeed. \nIn August 1991, he found himself sitting in Wheeler\u2019s River Sea Inn, sitting next to Pat McCow, the original owner of the Nehalem Bay Winery. \n\u201cWe got drunk,\u201d Shackleford said, \u201cHe was broke. I asked what he would want for half interest in the winery.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

The bill seeks to have the state pay 15 percent of contributions of the retirement system for teachers, police and firefighters. It will now go to the House floor for a vote. \n \nThe state once contributed 35 percent to the retirement system for teachers and first responders, but the Legislature abolished the state\u2019s contribution in 2011, leaving towns and cities to pick up the cost. \n \nThe bill\u2019s main sponsor, Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, said the legislation is vital for municipalities, who each lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in aid from the state in 2011. Hampton received between $600,000 and $700,000 for teachers\u2019 and first responders\u2019 retirement each year from the state before aid was cut in 2011. Portsmouth received more than $1 million a year from the state in retirement contributions for teachers, police and fire. \n \nThe state began paying 35 percent of the retirement system cost for police, firefighters and teachers in 1977 when the Legislature and governor passed that fixed percentage into law. In 2009, the state lowered its commitment to 30 percent. Rep. Jackie Cilley, D-Barrington, was a state senator in 2009 and recalled Gov. John Lynch stating the decrease in contribution was meant to be temporary, as the state was struggling through the recession at the time. Cilley said the Legislature underwent massive turnover in 2010 and Republicans wiped out the state\u2019s contribution to the system the next year. \n \nCushing, along with other proponents of bringing back the state contribution, have said the state made a \u201cpromise\u201d in 1977 to contribute to the system and lawmakers went back on that promise six years ago. \n \n\u201cThe state had a role in supporting public education and public safety,\u201d Cushing said. \u201cIt made a promise to communities it would partner and support retirement costs for teachers\u2026 police and fire.\u201d \n \nCushing said he proposed the state contribute 15 percent because he believes that would be more likely to pass than a request for the state to return to 35 percent. A cost analysis provided by the New Hampshire Retirement System states the bill would have the state contribution increase by $40.81 million in fiscal year 2018, and that number would increase slightly in the following three years. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a claw back in its attempt to hold the state accountable,\u201d Cushing said. \n \nOne of the committee members who voted against recommending the bill, Rep. Steven Beaudoin, R-Rochester, said he understood local taxpayers would benefit from the state contributing to the system. However, he believes the state should not be funding pensions for any town or city employees and questioned whether tax dollars raised from small towns should be used to pay for employee pensions in larger cities. \n \nBeaudoin also was concerned about where the money would come from, saying adding $40 million per year to the state\u2019s expenses is a \u201ctough nut to crack.\u201d \n \nCushing said no funds specifically have been identified to pay for the contribution, but he believes it should be the state\u2019s responsibility to pay that cost based on the Legislature\u2019s intent in 1977 to help fund pensions. \n \nCilley said the state demonstrated how much it valued reserving state dollars for the retirement system when it amended the state Constitution in 1984 to require money in the system solely be used for that purpose. At the time, she said, there was interest in raiding the funds for other uses. \n \n\u201cIf they want to do any one thing that will help the property taxpayers in this state, it\u2019s to go back to the promise they made to pay their contribution,\u201d Cilley said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Max Sullivan msullivan@seacoastonline.com @MaxSullivanLive"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"State retirement contribution bill heads to NH House","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"York","zipCode":"04043","state":"Maine","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kennebunk","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"York County Coast Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169701782","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"York County Coast Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200691802","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President.

They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq.

The only cure is sunshine, warmer weather and a blooming garden.\n\nShort of a tropical vacation, I\u2019ll just have to suck it up, buttercup, and conjure up mental images of lush gardens in place of gray skies and dirty snow. One of my favorite visions is ethereal cosmos fluttering in a summer breeze.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t I planted them in recent years?\n\nProbably because my gardens are stuffed with perennials, rose bushes and shrubs, and it\u2019s too hard to find a bare spot. This summer may be different with two charming new cosmos I\u2019m excited to try.\n\n\u201cXanthos\u201d is a true yellow cosmos, considered a first, according to the . It\u2019s not that soft white verging on cream we\u2019re told is \u201cyellow,\u201d but a real, soft, almost lemony yellow. A European garden award-winner, \u201cXanthos\u201d offers 2-1/2 inch blooms on a compact, well-branching dark green plant that grows from 10 to 24 inches tall. The flower shape is classic cosmos, and the plant blooms from summer until first frost. Like all cosmos, it requires full sun.\n\nThe unique cosmos \u201cCupcakes\u201d is a head-turner. It is rather amazing in appearance with fused petals that form a deep cup \u2014 like a cupcake paper liner. Single and semi-double blooms are 3 inches in diameter in shades of pink and white. There\u2019s also an all-white version of \u201cCupcakes.\u201d\n\nPlants are bushy, reaching 4 feet high by 2 feet wide and sturdy enough to stand up to heat, rain and drought.\n\nCosmos are known as being pollinator-friendly because they attract bees and butterflies. They also provide summer-long color. They\u2019re easy to grow, undemanding and tolerant of poor soil, humidity and heat.\n\nSurface-sow seeds into the garden after danger of frost and about 2 ½ months later, you\u2019ll have cosmos in full bloom. (Surface sowing is letting the seeds fall where they may and leaving them on the ground without covering with more soil.)\n\nAlthough you\u2019ll find cosmos as bedding plants, it\u2019s not likely you\u2019ll find newer introductions, so seeds may be the best way to go for this duet.\n\nNGB recommends pinching the tips of young stems for bushier, shorter plants.\n\nHere are some classic cosmos worth growing:\n\n\u201cSonata.\u201d Shades of pink from rose to cherry mixed with white.\n\n\u201cBright Lights.\u201d Smaller, semi-double flowers in bright yellows and oranges .\n\n\u201cDouble Take.\u201d Billowy full to semi-double flowers in bicolor pink with yellow eyes.\n\n\u201cSeashells.\u201d Rolled petals resemble \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 seashells in shades of pink and white.\n\n\u201cVelouette.\u201d Bicolor white flowers with red stripes.\n\n\u201cCapriola.\u201d Semi-dwarf plants with white flowers with red centers and red picottes.\n\n\u201cRose Bonbon.\u201d Fully double, rosy pink blooms with yellow eyes.\n\n\u201cAntiquity.\u201d Single blooms in mauve, copper and blush pink.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Melody Parker"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cosmos, the flower, not cocktail, is a cure-all for cabin fever","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Black Hawk","zipCode":"50701","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Waterloo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waterloo/Cedar Falls Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666809","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2398"},"name":"Waterloo/Cedar Falls Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcfcourier.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200697164","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wcfcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/de/ede499d6-e96d-5f77-9108-e0c6c147200a/588a241288e53.image.jpg?resize=946%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure.

It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and mark sheets have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\" Modi said. \n \nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam's failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. \n \nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. \n \n\"To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one's time to find ways. Use it for better purposes.

A person could apply to the N.H. secretary of state, pay a fee, and be authorized to perform only a civil marriage specifically designated on the registration form. Most of the fee would be deposited in an already existing state fund for domestic violence programs.  \n \nThe Office of Secretary of State estimated 300 special licenses would be issued per year, resulting in $24,000 in revenue for funding domestic violence programs. \n \nThe House Judiciary Committee voted \u200b13 to 5 to recommending that the bill be defeated.

Wuelper wrote, \" This bill seeks to allow a new state license authorizing any individual to perform a single specified marriage for a fee of $90, with $80 of that going into the victim\u2019s assistance fund.

Included are rules of process authorizing meeting notice requirements, quorums, and the methods of making and voting on motions of recommendation on individual bills heard at public hearings. \n \nRep. Timothy Smith, D-Manchester, offered a change to the rule that would encourage committees to allow citizens to speak before paid lobbyists at public hearings. The rule he wrote was \"to ensure on a best-effort basis that members of the public are recognized to testify at public hearings before individuals properly identified as lobbyists.\" \n \nHe pointed out that because of busy schedules, time may run out at public hearings before everyone wishing to speak can do so, and those not recognized to testify early may not be heard at all. Citizens who take a day off work to testify may not be heard. But a long-time committee chair opposed the new rule, saying the rule change could limit the committee from asking lobbyists to speak who may have important information to share. \n \nBefore the vote on the suggested new rule change, two legislators, one for passage and one against, were allowed to ask \"parliamentary questions,\" suggesting how legislators should vote. Those questions, a tradition in the legislature, often best sum up the issue just before a vote is taken. Those asking the question thereby recommend pressing the \"Green\" button on each legislator's' seat, which electronically is a vote for a motion, or the \"Red\" button, which casts a vote against the motion.  \n \nRep. Frost, supporting the rule change, asked \"If I know that this is the 'peoples' house' and not the 'lobbyists' house' would I now push the green button?\"  \n \nRep. Richard Hinch, R-Merrimack, asked, \"Mr. Speaker, if I have the utmost confidence in our leadership and our chairs and vice chairs regardless of political party over the years to have conducted the meetings in an orderly fashion, and if I believe also that the chairs are always cognizant of the rights of the public to speak and want to make sure that we want to hear from the public, do I now push the red button because this amendment is not necessary?\"  \n \nThe House voted 121 to 242 against the new rule. \"Yes\" favored the rule change, \"no\" opposed: \n \nHerald legislators \n \nYes: Altschiller, Cahill, Cushing, DiLorenzo, Edgar, Gilman, Le, Murray, Pantelakos, Read, Somssich, Ward \n \nNo: Abrami, Bean, Berrien, Cali-Pitts, Chase, Emerick, Francese, Pamela Gordon, Richard Gordon, Janvrin, Khan, Lovejoy, Malloy, Henry Marsh, McBeath, Messmer, Nigrello \n \nNot voting:  Farnham, Tilton \n \nFoster's legislators \n \nYes: Beaudoin, Bixby, Cilley, Comeau, Epstein, Frost, Grassie, Howard, Kaczynski, Keans, Maloney, Phinney, Salloway, Sandler, Treleaven, Wallace, Wuelper \n \nNo: Avellani, Burton, Cook, Dean-Bailey, Ellis, Fontneau, Gourgue, Graham, Horgan, Horrigan, Krans, William Marsh, McNally, Mullen, Nelson, Opderbecke, Schmidt, Scruton, Smith, Southworth, Spang, Sprague, Stone, Turcotte, Wall, Woitkun \n \nNot voting: Pitre, Vincent, excused; Berube, Harrington, Varney, not excused \n \nRoll call listings for legislators who do did not vote may have a reference of \"excused\" or \"not excused.\" If a member cannot attend a meeting or make a roll call due to illness or family and business obligations, they may inform the House speaker or Senate president and ask to be excused from the vote.

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Taranaki Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Taranaki Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200706463","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A director once told me that if there was no \u2018loony fringe organisation protesting around the time of release, it meant that the film hadn\u2019t generated enough interest\u2019. Having been at the receiving end of multiple protests over the years, the director\u2019s shrug and smile revealed more than his words. \n \nOn Friday afternoon, members of the Rajput Karni Sena assaulted Sanjay Leela Bhansali. The attack occurred on the sets of Bhansali\u2019s period drama Padmavati in Jaipur\u2019s Jaigarh Fort. Scores of Rajput Karni Sena protestors breached the private security of the set before proceeding to assault the director and vandalise the film\u2019s set. \n  \nFile image of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Solaris \n  \nThe attack was a triggered by rumours that Padmavati has a love sequence between Padmavati, the Queen of Chittor and Alauddin Khilji, the Delhi Sultan. \u201cThis is an outrageous distortion of Rajasthan's history as Rani Ji self-immolated herself along with other women of the fort when they heard that Khilji is marching ahead to take over the fort,\" said Mahipal Makrana, state president of Karni Seena. \n \nWhat makes this attack different from the ones in the past is not just that a highly respected member of Bollywood was physically manhandled but also that the film is still being shot. Few outside the industry have even seen the film\u2019s script but it doesn\u2019t take much for religious and caste sentiments to be hurt. \n \nWe seemed to have progressed from seemingly innocuous effigy burnings to all out physical attacks. Bollywood is partially to blame for this. Every single time a film or actor has been attacked, the industry has either cowed down or stayed quiet. \n \nIn the 1990s, it was only the Shiv Sena that terrorised the industry. Mani Ratnam's Bombay was 'censored' by Bal Thackeray before it was released. Shiv Sena ransacked theatres showing Deepa Mehta's Fire because it was 'polluting Indian culture'. Bollywood has given into bullying by political and religious groups film after film. \n \nThe problem now is that bullies have sprouted up all over the country. Ajay Devgn had to get approval from the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee before releasing Son of Sardar . Iron rod-wielding activists from Bajrang Dal vandalised movie theatres screening PK in Ahmedabad. There were protests against the Rajkumar Hirani film in different parts of the country because the film had hurt religious sentiments of Hindus by making fun of their gods and devotees. \n \nJust six months ago, Karan Johar, who tweeted in support of Bhansali on Saturday, put out a video promising to never work with Pakistani artists again. To ensure a smooth release of Raees , Shah Rukh met Raj Thackeray last month. The film\u2019s makers didn\u2019t include Pakistani actress Mahira Khan in any promotional activity. \n \nFriday\u2019s attack on Bollywood wasn\u2019t the first and won\u2019t be the last unless the industry unites. It\u2019s time for Bollywood as a collective to say \u2018enough is enough\u2019. Celebrities have to do better than just condemning the attack or tweeting their support. The only way to stand up to bullies is to go on the offensive and the industry must come together to put pressure on the government. It\u2019s time to take that target off your back, Bollywood.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: Bollywood news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Sanjay Leela Bhansali attacked on Padmavati set: It\u2019s time Bollywood stands up to the bullies","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"232003819","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"Firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200712375","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

CCC were bowled out for 129 after choosing to bat as left-arm spinner Veerasammy Permaul took 3 for 19 to decimate the CCC middle order. \nOpening batsman Amir Jangoo entered the game having made a pair of half-centuries in CCC's two wins to open up Group B, but he fell for a duck in the third over of the match to Ronsford Beaton and CCC continued to struggle throughout their innings before being bowled out in 44.5 overs. Guyana were disciplined with the ball, conceding a total of just four extras and took wickets at regular intervals as only two partnerships went beyond 20 runs. \n \nGuyana overcame the early loss of Assad Fudadin for 8 as Rajendra Chandrika and Raymon Reifer added 117 for the second wicket to take their side within one shot of victory. Reifer finished with a run a ball 67 to be named Man of the Match while ended unbeaten on 43 off 76 balls to secure victory with 23.3 overs to spare. \n \nEarlier in the day, Barbados recorded an eight-wicket win over ICC Americas at Three Ws Oval. Spin did the damage for Barbados as Ashley Nurse took 4 for 26 and Sulieman Benn 3 for 19 to bowl out ICC Americas for 103 in 34.2 overs. \n \nThe North American combined side got off to a promising start after batting first, reaching 57 for 2 after 18 overs, but Nurse sparked a slide of 8 for 46 with the wicket of captain Nitish Kumar to begin the 19th.

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\" \n \nAnother sticking point is training. \n \nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium. \n \nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1. \n \nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match. \n \nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was. \n \n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said. \n \nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries. \n \nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December. \n \n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said. \n \n\"It was really great. Next week might be asking too much, but at least she's back in the frame now and she's running herself around.\" \n \nW-LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL \n \nCanberra United v Melbourne City \n \nA-LEAGUE ROUND 18 \n \nSunday: Central Coast Mariners v Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium, 5pm.

January may not have done much to improve things, and it's not hard for feelings of disappointment to invade your relationship with God too. We live in a broken world full of suffering and pain, and yet we were also made to experience love, wonder, and profound joy, even in the midst of that world. \n \nFinding joy in the midst of real struggle is not simple or easy, and can never be reduced to a simple formula or quick mental exercise. Nonetheless, the Bible has much to say about the spiritual gift of joy. Here are ten examples to ponder and pray with. \n \nPsalms 43:4, 65:8 \n \nThe psalms are full of songs which bring together singing and joy. God is the source of joy, and he brings out joy from creation: \n  \n  \n\"Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.\" (Psalm 43.4) \n \n\"The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy.\" (Ps 65.8) \n \nNehemiah 8:10 \n \nNehemiah tells the people to celebrate, to share generously and to remember where true joy comes from, even when grief seems more natural. \n \n\"Nehemiah said, \"Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.\"\" \n \nPsalm 16:11 \n \nGod's favour endures beyond his anger, and so too joy endures beyond pain: \n \n\"For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.\" \n \nIsaiah 51:3 \n \n\"The Lord will surely comfort Zion and will look with compassion on all her ruins; he will make her deserts like Eden, her wastelands like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of singing.\" \n \nJohn 15:11 \n \nHere Jesus tells his disciples to remain in his love, and then tells them why: \n \n\"I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.\" \n \nLater, he tells his disciples that weeping and mourning will come, even as others rejoice, but that eventually, that grief will be transformed: \"Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.\" (16.20) \n \nActs 14:17 \n \nPaul's speech here reminds us that all human beings - even non-believers - can experience joy, this is the generous grace of God: \n \n\"Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.\" \n \nRomans 15:13 \n \nJoy, like peace, comes from God, for a powerful purpose in our lives: hope. \n \n\"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.\" \n \n1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 \n \nHere Paul tells the Thessalonians that the joy that motivates him, and that he longs for, is the growth and salvation of the Thessalonians themselves. \n \n\"For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you? Indeed, you are our glory and joy.\" \n \n2 Corinthians 8:2 \n \nHere Paul reminds us of how joy can be found in adversity, and can be a source of generosity and life to others: \n \n\"In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.\" \n \nHebrews 12:1-3 : \n \nThis famous passage tells of how it was joy that brought Jesus to the suffering of the cross, the joy of the hope that was to come. Joy does not eradicate adversity, but can lead us through it, and that in turn can inspire others. \n \n\"...And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.

Tough loss, but its unique about basketball. We play on Tuesday and will need to regroup.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"02210","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Boston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Braintree Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172081069","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Braintree Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.braintree.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695200727206","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Those include potentially deploying additional advisers to Iraq and Syria, allowing U.S. military personnel to accompany local forces closer to the front lines, and delegating greater decision-making power to field commanders. \n \nAs he signed his directive at his desk in the Oval Office, Trump said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very successful. That\u2019s big stuff.\u201d \n \nCounseling Trump in the effort will be Stephen Bannon, the White House chief strategist whose influence inside the administration is expanding far beyond politics. In an executive order, Trump reorganized the National Security Council to, along with other changes, give Bannon a regular seat on the principals committee \u2013 the meetings of the most senior national security officials, including the secretaries of defense and state. \n \nTrump\u2019s order also states that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs will sit on the principals committee only when the issues to be discussed pertain to their \u201cresponsibilities and expertise.\u201d In the previous two administrations, both were included as regular attendees. \n \nThe White House thinks the changes will make the National Security Council more adaptive to modern threats. Trump said the changes would bring \u201ca lot of efficiency and, I think, a lot of additional safety.\u201d \n \nThe changes affirm the ascent of Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative website that is popular with white nationalists. Bannon has emerged as Trump\u2019s political consigliere and the keeper of the president\u2019s populist flame. \n \nBannon has already been playing a major role in directing Trump\u2019s foreign policy, administration officials say, and joined the president in the Oval Office on Saturday for his calls with Putin and several other world leaders. \n \nIn their call, Putin and Trump discussed Ukraine and Syria, and they agreed to build stronger economic ties between the United States and Russia, according to a statement issued by the Kremlin. They said they would arrange an in-person meeting, but Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Interfax news agency that the two presidents did not specifically talk about a lifting of the sanctions the Obama administration imposed against Russia over Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine. \n \nEliminating the sanctions is a priority for Moscow, but Trump is under pressure in the United States to maintain them and said Friday that he thought it was premature to consider lifting them. \n \nThe White House described the conversation as \u201ca congratulatory call\u201d initiated by Putin. \n \n\u201cThe positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,\u201d read a statement from the White House. \u201cBoth President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today\u2019s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern.\u201d \n \nThis was one of five conversations Trump had Saturday with world leaders. Seeking to cultivate a personal rapport, Trump spoke with the leaders of Australia, France, Germany and Japan, but his administration\u2019s suspension of the acceptance of all refugees and a suspension of entry by citizens from seven majority-Muslim nations injected some diplomatic tension into the conversations. \n \nIn their call, French President Francois Hollande told Trump that he believes defending their democracies would be effective only if their governments adhere to \u201cthe principles on which they are founded, in particular the reception of refugees,\u201d according to the Elysee Palace, the French president\u2019s office. \n \nTrump\u2019s conversation with Putin was hotly anticipated, considering the warmth with which each man has spoken of the other. \n \nTrump spoke with Putin from behind his desk in the Oval Office, which was stacked with papers and a glass of Diet Coke. The president was flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, national security adviser Michael Flynn, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and Bannon. \n \nTrump began the day with a call to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discuss security and trade issues between the two countries and the mutual threat posed by North Korea, according to the White House. \n \nAbe, who during Trump\u2019s transition phase became the first foreign leader to talk face-to-face with the president-elect, agreed to meet Trump during a visit to Washington on Feb. 10, according to the White House. \n \nTrump then spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he had blasted repeatedly on the campaign trail over the German policy of admitting large numbers of Syrian refugees. Trump and Merkel covered a range of issues, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to the White House. \n \nAfter Trump\u2019s criticism of NATO during his campaign, the president and Merkel agreed on the alliance\u2019s \u201cfundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community,\u201d read a White House statement. \n \nTrump accepted Merkel\u2019s invitation to visit Hamburg, in July for the G-20 summit, and Trump invited the chancellor to visit Washington soon, the White House said. \n \nLater Saturday, Trump talked with Hollande as well as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Hollande told Trump that it was important to maintain the Paris agreement on climate change, according to Hollande\u2019s office. Trump has said he wants the United States to withdraw from the accord. \n \nIn Moscow, leaders had expressed cautious optimism that the new American leader could forge stronger ties than Obama did. From Moscow\u2019s point of view, lifting the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration for interference in the presidential election and Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine would be a good start, as would a reduction of NATO\u2019s military presence near Russia\u2019s borders. \n \nTrump has said he sees his posture toward Putin as in the geopolitical interests of the United States. He has consistently argued that Russia can be a strong ally, saying the two countries could cooperate on counterterrorism as well as countering nuclear proliferation. \n \nU.S. lawmakers from both parties \u2013 as well as some of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees \u2013 have raised alarms, or at least questioned, his approach. \n \nAlso on Saturday, Trump signed an executive order finalizing new lobbying rules that had been informally established during the transition period. It stipulates that administration officials cannot register as lobbyists for five years after leaving the government \u2013 and can never lobby on behalf of a foreign government. \n \n\u201cMost of the people standing behind me won\u2019t be able to go to work or do anything adverse to our wonderful country,\u201d Trump said, as the aides standing behind him in the Oval Office laughed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Philip Rucker and David Filipov"},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump orders ISIS plan, talks with Putin and gives Bannon national security role - Sat, 28 Jan 2017 PST","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spokane","zipCode":"99201","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spokane","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spokesman-Review.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685632","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4935"},"name":"Spokesman-Review.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://spokesmanreview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200735532","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:58Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.spokesman.com/photos/2017/01/28/Trump.JPG_t75x75_fsharpen.jpg?c089dee51a6323bd6b38604bb2cb9f7270a1e6f9"}],"video":[]}}

Turn away from evil and do good.Search for peace, and work to maintain it.\u201d \n\nThere are several secrets to a good happy life in Christ Jesus. However Peter introduces us to some three secrets of good life. \n\nKeep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from telling lies. Speaking evil is when one speaks to themselves doom, negatives, calamities and other such negative confessions that do not conform to the Word. Mostly people speak these to get sympathy from others. People have attracted death or sickness by speaking more about it and attracting the same through confessions. Telling lies is about speaking that which may appeal to the senses but is against the Word. This includes but not limited to saying that you are a failure when God looks at you as a success. Saying you can\u2019t do it when God says you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you(Philip 4:13). \n\nThe tongue just speaks what is in the heart. To avoid both lies and evil, study and meditate on the Word. The Word will dominate and change your language for success and victory. You will have good days always regardless of the situation. \n\n2)Turn away from evil and do good. Thus practicing righteousness. When you are a born again you are made righteous(2 Cor 5:21). It is important to live as such. Psalm 34:17. \u201cThe righteous cry, and the LORD hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles.\u201d Psalm 37:25 \u201d I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.\u201d Although they pass through persecutions, the righteous always live good happy days regardless of the circumstances surrounding them. Pro11:18 \u201cThe righteous person is delivered from trouble; it comes upon the wicked instead.\u201d \n\n(3)Search for peace, and work to maintain it. Have peace in your life by choosing not to worry regardless of the situation. Instead pray and maintain your peace. Phil 4: 6-7 \u201d Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, in every situation, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, tell your requests to God. And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.\u201d \n\nBe a peace maker to others. Mat5:9\u2033Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\u201d Heb 12:14\u2033 Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.\u201d Those who bring peace are given peace. Learn to be peace makers in every situation. You will enjoy the same peace.1 Timo 2:2 \u201cPray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives..\u201d \n\nConfession I refuse to have a bad and unhappy day regardless of the circumstances in my life. I will always be full of joy and having good days. I am a peace maker to myself and my environment. I live as a righteous person. I speak in line with the Word. In the Name of Jesus.

Through a microscopic view of Malawi urban music, the following liabilities have been noted. \n\nLack of originality \n\nBeing a culturally diverse country, many songs coming out fall short of cultural values therein. Instead the American hip hop culture is dominating the art, as most artists yearn for prestige. They believe urban music should reflect foreign life if it is to befit that status. Yes, local languages are used but only as a channel for transferring foreign ideologies. \n\nA good number of urban musicians are busy promoting other cultures while ignoring their roots. Judging them by the type of music they do, in other countries they can be confused as their own. On this note, Nigerians must be very proud of Malawians for helping in promoting their culture through music. \n\nDan Lu in Sweet Banana does it the Nigerian way with only languages used separating him to Kcee, the featured artist. It\u2019s the same story in his other song, Sorry, in terms of style. In Nyamulira, Dali\u2019s song on which he was just featured, the trend continues. \n\nWorse still, Nigerian music is now being identified as afro music thus every artist doing music along those lines is called an afro artist. A new clique in town, Twin M, has added numbers to copycats of Nigerian musicians. \n\nBut what serves as perfect examples for music besieged by traits of local culture? Mwini Zinthu by Blaze and Ril B, Undiberekere Mwana by Postnegative, Chipapapa by Tay Grin, Maybe tomorrow by Theo Thompson, and Moto by Piksy, to mention a few. These are the songs we can confidently present to other parts of the world and say, \u201cthis is Malawi music.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not about preaching against foreign genres but to what extent are local cultural values embedded. Look at how Tay Grin has transformed hip hop into Nyau Music, no wonder he is one of the very few local artists recognised outside the country. \n\nImpatience \n\nThis is one of the major setbacks in Malawi music. Most artists rush to studios with work that is not ripe enough. Creating good music involves a lot; writing lyrics, practicing, recording a demo, and polishing up the work. This requires time but in Malawi it does not work that way as artists write lyrics while in studio. Let veteran musician Sir Soldier Lucius Banda who can spend two years writing songs be a standard. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that artists are so quick to gain fame and make money. This makes most artists lose touch after a few years. Music is an inborn art which one has to enjoy, it has to be baked without thinking of its rewards. When listening to Lulu, one can tell that he takes time in developing a song. \n\nLack of promotion \n\nThere are very few music promoters in the country making most artists manage themselves. This is a serious problem to up and coming MCs without a financial backbone on which their talent can lean on. As a result they end up working with cheap studios where quality is compromised. \n\nSurely making music is not cheap, more money is required when the song is out to carter for marketing purposes. It\u2019s sad that music is no longer selling as it used to before the internet took shape in the country. Fans would rather download a song than buy a CD in this age, and this has reduced music to a game for only those with financial backing and not those with talent. \n\nHowever most artists have a problem; you sign them only to be dumped once they rise.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 37 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200742560","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 32 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"27116","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winston Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WXII 12","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688608","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"92"},"name":"WXII 12","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wxii12.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200750292","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The leader, who had been one of the towering figures of the Congress for nearly 50 years, had quit last night, miffed that he was being sidelined in the party. The senior leaders of the state Congress - including Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and state party chief G Parameshwara - had said they were unaware of Mr Krishna's decision. \n\"I felt for some time that Congress doesn't need me, the party now depends on situation managers. They do not want time-tested leaders and workers,\" said Mr Krishna, who had served as a central minister under former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi and had been the External Affairs Minister in the Manmohan Singh government since 2009.   \n\"I have won elections and have been defeated. According to me, age is a state of mind, age shouldn't be a criteria, there are people who are young but not active,\" said Mr Krishna, who had quit as the Governor of Maharashtra in 2008. \nAiming to return to active politics, he had toured the state extensively to campaign ahead of the 2013 assembly elections in the state, which the Congress won . \"Nobody questioned my age then. Unfortunately it is somebody else who decides, not me,\" he said. \n\n \nMr Krishna said many have asked him to reconsider, \"But I stick to my decision of quitting Congress.\" \nWhile the next step is not decided, he said it was a time for \"introspection\" for him - a process that will involve family and friends. \"I have no plans to meet the PM. All are speculations...  I am not in a position to spell out what my future plan is,\" Mr Krishna said. \n\nBut he made it clear that he was not planning to retire. \"Retirement is not a word in my dictionary...

To address this deficiency and to enhance the engaging experience of the visitors, the Rajghat Samadhi Samiti, under the Ministry of Urban Development has undertaken several initiatives during the last two years and they will be inaugurated tomorrow on the occasion of the 69th death anniversary of the Father of the Nation. These initiatives come 15 years after last such major improvement works at Rajghat. \n \nFor the first time, a 157 word brief profile of Mahatma and a 131 word description of Gandhi Samadhi have been put on display, both in Hindi and English,  at all the three gates of Rajghat. \n \nThe profile says Mahatma espoused \u201cTruth, Non-violence, Sarvadharma Samabhava, Gram Swaraj, Trusteeship and Swadeshi which are the building blocks of a new social order free from all kinds of exploitation, discrimination and domination\u201d.  Profile on Rajghat says \u201c The Samadhi reflects the simplicity of Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s life\u201d. \n \n30 Amrit Vachans (eternally relevant thoughts of Gandhiji) have been engraved on marble and displayed on granite stone pedestals for inspiring the visitors to Rajghat. These include-\u201cInnumerable are the names of God; but if a choice were to be made of one, it would be Sat or Satya, that is Truth. Hence, verily Truth is God\u201d, \u201cHe who is unable to rule over self, can never really succeed in ruling over others\u201d and \u201cHe who is truly clean within, can not remain unclean without\u201d.  These pedestals have been designed to merge with the ambience and architecture of Rajghat and each pedestal illuniated by LED light atop aesthetically designed light post. \n \nAll the existing conventional lights at Rajghat Complex have been replaced by energy efficient and environment friendly LED lights and are placed atop 104 aesthetically designed poles replacing the old ones. These LED lights result in energy saving of 60,000 KWH annually. Solar panels have been installed above roof tops and cycle shed at the parking area of Rajghat that will generate 52 KW of energy. \n \nFor enhanced security and better monitoring of visitors, 27 CCTV cameras have been installed with a Central Control Room for monitoring. \n \nBesides inaugurating these new initiatives tomorrow i.e January 30, 2016, Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu will also release a special edition of Rajghat Samadhi Patrika, commemorating the 100th year of Champaran Satyagraha launched by Gandhiji. \n \nOther major initiatives taken up  and executed during the last two years include; setting up of Kasturba Gandhi Souvenir Store in the parking area for making available souvenirs related to Gandhiji at reasonable prices, Landscaping, regressing, improvement of water bodies and plantation, Laying of Cobbled Stone on the road between parking area of Rajghat and Samadhi to regulate speed of vehicles, setting up of CISF Control Rooms near the main gates and equipped with modern gadgets like DFMD, X-ray machines etc. \n \nA two day  International Seminar was held by the Rajghat Samadhi Samiti in  March, 2015, the first of its kind on the theme \u201cClean and Capable India of Gandhi\u2019s Dream\u201d .  A quarterly \u2018Rajghat Smadhi Patrika\u2019 was launched on this occasion by the President Shri Pranab Mukherjee and since being published by the Rajghat Samadhi Samiti chaired by the Urban Development Minister, to spread Gandhian thoughts.

Sixteen groups and projects in England have shared the funds. The Isles of Scilly have also received funding form the Arts Council England to promote cultural tourism.\n\nCornwall 365 bosses said the funding will be used to support young people to be cultural ambassadors, help build a distinctive events programme, and create a new travel app for Cornwall.\n\nFiona Wotton, director of Cornwall 365, said: \"Tourism and the creative industries are very significant sectors in the Cornish economy and by working in partnership we are connecting new audiences with our year-round cultural experiences, creating economic value and celebrating our distinctive and fascinating region.\" Cornwall 365 is a network of leading cultural and tourism organisations and since its launch in 2014, has been helping locals and visitors to experience a deeper sense of the region, enhancing their bond with the place and putting culture at the heart of Cornwall's visitor economies.\n\nThis has increased audiences and footfall, added economic value and ensured visitors return to the area. \n\nCornwall 365 has also run a series of sessions encouraging people in the tourism sector to become 'cultural ambassadors'.

Here is a peek into this hidden location.\n\nAntony Woodland Garden near Torpoint reopens to the public on March 1. A haven of peace and tranquility, it is one of the least-known gems among the many public and private gardens the county has to offer. This year the Carew Pole Garden Trust, which runs the gardens, is hoping more people than ever before will visit the unique location, an International Camellia Gardens of Excellence.\n\nWatch and discover stunning Antony Woodland Garden:\n\nSir Richard Carew Pole, former president of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \"This is not the lost garden of Cornwall, but the undiscovered one. Sitting on the banks of the Lynher the garden has something for both serious gardeners and those after a relaxing walk in beautiful surroundings.\" The gardens run along the Lynher Estuary, an area of outstanding natural beauty, and are also renowned for their stunning magnolias, rhododendrons, wildflowers and sculptures - loved by professional and amateur gardeners alike. \n\nThe variety of flora and fauna has been planted by successive generations of the Carew Pole family, who have lived at grade one-listed Antony House since the early 18th century. The 100-acre garden is home to more than 600 varieties of camellias, including the National Collection of Camellia japonica, and nearly 250 types of magnolias. All of these come alive when they bloom in the spring, with walks covered in wild flowers including celandines, primroses, bluebells and campion. \n\nThe gardens are divided into two areas \u2013 the Woodland Garden and the Woodland Walk, situated where the River Lynher flows into the Tamar, with views across to Brunel's Royal Albert Rail Bridge. They boast beautiful walks, stunning scenery and the chance to see wild birds, including oystercatchers, grey herons, egrets, cormorants and shelducks along the estuary. Antony Woodland Garden will be open from 11am until 5pm every day except Mondays and Fridays, although they will be open over bank holidays and Good Friday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Watch this sneak peek at hidden gem: the majestic Antony Woodland...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Cornwall","zipCode":"TR1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Carrick","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cornish Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"369185999","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"148"},"name":"Cornish Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://cornishguardian.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cornwalllive.com/9-pictures-that-prove-polhawn-fort-near-torpoint-should-be-named-top-coastal-wedding-venue-in-the-uk/story-30083151-detail/story.html#GA910g8glhj9WW8o.99","http://www.cornwalllive.com/rick-stein-to-host-his-sixth-beer-mussels-festival-in-cornwall/story-30081967-detail/whatson/story.html#e7z5zzrL80OzFuEr.99","http://www.cornwalllive.com/st-ives-b-b-west-by-five-named-the-ninth-best-in-the-world-in-tripadvisor-travellers-choice-awards/story-30079379-detail/story.html","http://www.cornwalllive.com/1-in-5-of-us-has-one-major-exhibition-of-british-tattoo-art-at-national-maritime-museum-cornwall/story-30085215-detail/story.html#zHKvxKdwIthD7UKx.99","http://www.cornwalllive.com/","https://www.facebook.com/cornwalllivenews/"],"sequenceId":"695200759511","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.cornwalllive.com/images/localworld/ugc-images/276391/Article/images/30086504/15820075.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.cornwalllive.com/images/localworld/ugc-images/276391/Article/images/30086504/15820075-thumb.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

While they were still swimming, Proud drowned and one of his friends who saw him dashed home to seek help from adults. It's a walkable distance but it was too late to save him, I assume that when the boy arrived at his home it was already late to save Proud,\" said Mrs Sibanda. \n\nMrs Sibanda said the Bulawayo City Council should fence off the dam because most children were frequenting it to swim. \n\n\"Our children are not safe; the city council should fence off that dam or fill it up because soon it will be a death pool.

The Cavaliers let Matthew Dellavedova walk last summer because of the cost (with tax he would have cost them north of $30 million) and they had Mo Williams under contract for this season. Except on the day before training camp started Williams decided to walk away from the game on top.

Sources say one vet known to interest the Cavs \u2014 one who possesses a salary that would fit into that exception \u2014 is Utah\u2019s Shelvin Mack at $2.4 million. Mack, according to sources, is most definitely available. The Cavs, though, would be forced to use the $4.8 million trade exception they just created in the Kyle Korver deal (with an expiration date of Jan. 7, 2018) to absorb the salary of Denver\u2019s Jameer Nelson , who is said to be another Cleveland target but makes $4.5 million this season. \n  \nAlso out there, Mario Chalmers and Jarrett Jack are free agents looking to make comebacks off injuries. \n \nThe other option for the Cavaliers is to see what players might get waived after the trade deadline, for example, the Bulls could decide to buy out Rajon Rondo . Frankly, Nelson would be a better fit in the locker room and willingly would take on the backup role, but if the Cavs are willing to wait out the market there could be interesting names available for cheap. Of course, that comes with the roll of the dice about who will be available. \n \nAll just things to watch. It\u2019s far more likely to happen than the Carmelo Anthony trade ideas.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Report: Cavrs could target Mack, Nelson in trades","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"NBC Sports","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587644","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"NBC Sports","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nbcsports.com","publisher":"National Broadcasting Company"},"linkedArticles":[{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391869014"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392087594"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392765584"}],"dataFormat":"video","outboundUrls":["http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/927/lebron-james","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/2243/matthew-dellavedova","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/2633/kay-felder","http://www.espn.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/4937/the-2016-17-nba-all-no-trade-team","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/1070/anderson-varejao","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/1857/shelvin-mack","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/977/kyle-korver","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/1060/jameer-nelson","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/1272/rajon-rondo","http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/929/carmelo-anthony"],"sequenceId":"695200764682","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Turns out it wasn\u2019t. \n \nThe White House made the decision not to list those who were persecuted by Nazis, including gays and lesbians, and instead labeled them all as \u201cinnocent people\u201d killed by \u201cNazi terror.\u201d The CEO of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, called that \u201cpuzzling and troubling\u201d even before Hicks confirmed it was intentional. \n \nIt\u2019s disturbing because history is factual, as pointed out by John Podhoretz for  Commentary magazine in response to the Hicks comment on CNN. \n \n\u201cNo, Hope Hicks, and no to whomever you are serving as a mouthpiece,\u201d wrote Podhoretz. \u201cThe Nazis killed an astonishing number of people in monstrous ways and targeted certain groups\u2014Gypsies, the mentally challenged, and open homosexuals, among others. But the Final Solution was aimed solely at the Jews. The Holocaust was about the Jews. There is no \u2018proud\u2019 way to offer a remembrance of the Holocaust that does not reflect that simple, awful, world-historical fact. To universalize it to \u2018all those who suffered\u2019 is to scrub the Holocaust of its meaning.\u201d \n \n\u201cThere are no word limits in presidential statements,\u201d wrote Josh Marshall, editor for Talking Points Memo . \u201cA more logical and worthwhile approach would be to note the various groups who were victimized. This isn't accidental. The new administration is riddled with anti-Semites and those who want to cater to anti-Semites.\u201d \n \nOthers pointed out that minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people reeks of Russia. Roberta Kaplan, the attorney who represented Edie Windsor at the Supreme Court when gutting a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act, noted the history. \n  \nExactly. Russians have a long history of trying to erase Jewish deaths from Holocaust. https://t.co/5uvgA6txSQ \n \n\u2014 Robbie Kaplan (@kaplanrobbie) January 29, 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Lucas Grindley"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Jewish news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump Invokes 'All Lives Matter' Logic to Erase Jews from Holocaust","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Advocate.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665088","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"383"},"name":"Advocate.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.advocate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/white-house-holocaust-memorial-day/index.html","http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/01/28/team_trump_just_all_lives_matter_ed_the_holocaust.html","https://t.co/9qNhBxx5iP","https://twitter.com/SoloChills/status/825510306961096704","https://t.co/3tEeXfO9WF","https://twitter.com/_Zeets/status/825507056501268480","https://twitter.com/hashtag/holocaustremembrance?src=hash","https://t.co/MQNIAjnZpz","https://twitter.com/CaitEmmaS/status/825581056543690754","https://twitter.com/JGreenblattADL/status/825029533581520896","https://www.commentarymagazine.com/politics-ideas/the-white-house-holocaust-horror/","http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/bannon-s-deathly-hand","https://t.co/5uvgA6txSQ","https://twitter.com/kaplanrobbie/status/825579559747743744"],"sequenceId":"695200771177","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:10:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200774700","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That is a ­Constitutional violation. See u in court.\" \n \nStephanie Grisham, a White House spokeswoman, said: \"The high-risk territories are based on Congressional statute and ­nothing else.\" \n \nTrump has handed over management of his real estate, licensing and merchandising business to his sons to avoid the perception that he is making presidential decisions to boost his own business. \n \nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump has retained ownership of the ­company, meaning if it thrives during his presidency, he will profit. \n \nThe President's order makes no mention of Turkey, which has faced several terrorist attacks in recent months. \n \nThe State Department on Wednesday updated a travel warning for Americans visiting Turkey, noting that \"an increase in anti-American rhetoric has the potential to inspire independent actors to carry out acts of violence against US citizens\". \n \nTrump has licensed his name to two luxury towers in Istanbul. A Turkish company also manufactures a line of Trump-branded home furnishings. \n \n\"I have a little conflict of ­interest 'cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul',\" he had said in December 2015. \n \nAlso untouched by Friday's ­executive order is the UAE, a powerful Muslim ally with whom the US ­has complicated ­relations. \n \nTrump has licensed his name to a Dubai golf resort as well as a luxury home ­development and spa. \n \nIts ­developer, Hussain Sajwani, attended a New Year's eve party at Trump's Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, where a video showed the then President-elect singling him out for praise, calling him and his family \"the most beautiful people\". \n \n© 2017 IANS India Private Limited.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 33 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200780944","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Buncombe","zipCode":"28802","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Asheville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Asheville Citizen-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661313","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2104"},"name":"Asheville Citizen-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.citizen-times.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695200795614","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

Over the past 10 years, both organizations have cooperated on annual surveys and outreach programs as part of an early detection and eradication approach to prevent pecan weevil establishment in the western region. \n \nRecently pecan weevil has been identified in one residential tree in Clovis and one residential tree in Roswell. Additional pecan trees were identified with pecan weevil in Artesia and Hobbs. \n \nAs a result of the recent pecan weevil findings, the New Mexico Department of Agriculture has implemented a sixty day quarantine effective January 27. To limit the spread of pecan weevil from infested residential trees to commercial orchards, movement of pecans produced within the city limits of Clovis, Roswell, Hobbs, and Artesia are restricted. This restriction requires a certificate from the New Mexico Department of Agriculture stating specific pecans meet one or more of the following requirements: \n \n\u2022 Pecans that are sold, traded or gifted in a manner that meet the phytosanitary requirements of the receiving location and are transported in a department approved manner; \n \n\u2022 Pecans treated at 0 degrees for 168 continuous hours, or other department-approved treatment methods; \n \n\u2022 The inspection of a pecan sample in which no pecans exhibit signs of the pecan weevil or exhibit the presence of the weevil; and/or, \n \n\u2022 Pecans originating in the quarantined area but believed, by the department not to have the presence of the pecan weevil. \n \nSpecifics regarding the certification of pecan nuts can be found within the quarantine rule at http://nmdaportal.nmsu.edu/nmda/laws-regulations/ . Information is also available at the affected area\u2019s County Cooperative Extension Offices. \n \nResidential and commercial pecan tree owners should be on the lookout for pecans with round, BB-sized holes in the shells, or legless, white grubs inside the pecan nut. If you suspect you have pecan weevil in your residential pecan trees, contact your local County Cooperative Extension Office. \n \nChaves County residents may contact Sandra Barraza at 575-622-3210. Lea County residents should contact Wayne Cox at 575-396-2819. Residents in Eddy County should contact Woods Houghton at 575-887-6595. Curry County residents should contact David Dunlap at 575-763-6505. \n \nNew Mexico Department of Agriculture and New Mexico State University\u2019s Cooperative Extension Service will continue to work with city elected officials and residents of affected areas on education and eradication efforts. \n \nRead or Share this story: http://lcsun.co/2jGRtAx","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sun-News Reports"},"topics":[],"title":"News Pecan weevil affects residential pecan trees","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Eddy","zipCode":"88221","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Carlsbad","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Current-Argus","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169691932","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"551"},"name":"Current-Argus","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.currentargus.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://nmdaportal.nmsu.edu/nmda/laws-regulations/","http://lcsun.co/2jGRtAx"],"sequenceId":"695200795790","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

After the vet gave her a steroid shot, she rallied and then began to fail. I am guilt-ridden that I did not take quicker action to take the 90-minute drive to a nearby larger city to help her. The local vet took the weekend off, and in that time, my little pup couldn't breathe and her heart and lungs failed. \n \nCould I have saved her? She passed Dec. 10 at 4:20 p.m. She was born Sept. 8, 2006. It seemed to be a boondoggle of missed communications and my delayed reaction, for which my regrets are profound. Was her passing pre-ordained, or did I really mess up? -- Distraught Pet Owner \n \nDEAR DISTRAUGHT PET OWNER: I chose your email firstly because I am a dog lover who has been fortunate enough to have several tiny teacup pups grace my life. A vast number of small dogs have trachea problems, and many have a similar fate as your little pup. \n \nSecondly, I wanted to let people know that a pet\u2019s natal chart is just as revealing as yours or mine. I make a point to ask for the birth data of the dogs I bring home to ensure that they will be a good fit for my family as well as to see if any health issues are revealed that will help me look out for the animal's best interest. \n \nAfter looking at your pup's chart, it is obvious that she was prone to problems with the trachea, lungs and inflammation, and I highly doubt given the transits that she was going through in December that she could have bypassed her fate. More than half of her chart was under siege, with many indicators pointing to a sudden and unexpected ending. \n \nHad you reacted sooner and headed to the big city, she would have been put through greater stress. Being in the comfort of her home with you by her side would have been her choice. \n \nAs animal lovers, it\u2019s difficult to let go of our pets; at the same time, we know their lifespan is short. Don\u2019t let this loss deter you from giving another little critter a chance to have a loving home and you as a companion. It will do you both a world of good. If there is a doggie heaven, it will make your pup proud of you. \n \nDEAR EUGENIA: I was born May 6, 1973, at 3:47 a.m. Would you please give me some insight on romantic relationships? I have been told previously that Cancers would be an ideal match, but I dated one off and on many moons ago, and one more recently, and they really threw me for a loop. I wouldn't dare date another! \n \nI always find myself mentally and physically attracted to Aquarians, but know from experience and astrology that they are probably the worst sign for me. I also find myself attracted to Geminis and Scorpios, but I don't think either would be a good match due to the twin's split personality and the scorpion's moods. \n \nI feel my best matches through experience are Capricorns, but they tend to be hard to figure out, as they don't share or express their feelings easily or clearly. I don't mean in a deceitful way -- they just don't know how to express themselves, which leaves me confused. \n \nI am currently interested in someone born Dec, 28, 1959. I also feel like I could be very compatible with a Pisces. What do you think? -- Taurus \n \nDEAR TAURUS: You should never go by Sun signs. That is why astrologers offer astrological compatibility charts. No one\u2019s chart is composed of one sign. For example, you are a Taurus by Sun sign, and although you do have your natal Sun, Mercury and Venus in that sign, you have strong Aries, Gemini, Cancer, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius influences. Although Capricorns do mix nicely with the Taurus and Cancer in your chart, the area of your chart that deals with relationships doesn\u2019t bode well with a goat. \n \nWhat I am trying to tell you is that your chart is like your fingerprint, and to find a good match you must consider all the planets and luminaries and their placements in both charts to see what\u2019s favorable and what isn\u2019t. \n \nNo relationship is perfect, but if you are both willing to work together to build something special and you are aware of the flaws that might hinder your relationship, you can strengthen your bond. \n \nRegarding your Capricorn man: He thinks like a Sagittarius and loves like a Scorpion. The planets and luminary he has in Sagittarius (Moon, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter) fall in an area of your chart that deals with learning lessons; therefore, he is probably in your life to teach you something. The comparison, although decent, shows limitations along with some deception. \n \nAstrologically, I feel you can do better, but if you are both willing to work toward establishing an equal relationship, you may overcome the limitations that appear. \n \nDEAR EUGENIA: Is my life going to get better? Will I ever meet someone to share my life with? \n \nI am a widow, born Sept. 14, 1951, at 10:10 a.m. I retired early due to illness. I've been alone for 14 years, dealing with trying to live on disability and taking care of two grandsons. That stress alone has made life miserable. \n \nI try to think positively, and I am thankful I manage to pay the bills and put food on the table. I'm tired of being lonely. I would like someone to share good times with, but I want someone who won't run when bad times hit. -- Lonely Widow \n \nDEAR LONELY WIDOW: Anything is possible, but first you must get past the couple of years that have beaten you down so harshly. You have been facing some major limitations, and that can make it difficult for you to get out and meet people. \n \nThe next couple of years do hold greater opportunities for you, but you will have to get organized if you want to take advantage of what\u2019s out there for you. Socializing is the most important thing; however, that can be difficult when you are caring for little ones and you don\u2019t have money. \n \nBetween now and the fall of next year, it\u2019s important for you to take the time to explore your options and look for help in your community and organizations where other grandparents like yourself have been given the task of raising their children\u2019s children. This appears to be a growing phenomenon, and one that requires great strength and courage. If there isn\u2019t such an affiliation in your community, start one or look for one online. \n \nIf you can get this part of your life in order, you will be able to surround yourself with the support and help you need to have a little \u201cme time.\u201d You will find what and who you are looking for next fall. Nothing will change without help. Take the steps to make it happen. \n \n(To have Eugenia answer your queries: eugenialast.com, click Dear Eugenia and fill in the form.

El mi-a spus că l-am liniștit mai mult decât a reușit avocatul lui în doi ani, în termeni de ce va păți, cum să scurteze sentința și cum să profite de programe ca să iasă mai devreme.\" \n \nLevine e tipul la care apelează bogătanii când nu mai au nicio scăpare. Au fost prinși, inculpați și pe punctul de a fi condamnați. Pârnaia bate la ușă, iar în momentul ăla nasol unii americani înstăriți cochetează cu ideea de a angaja un consultant de închisoare, cineva care pretinde să cunoască sistemul ca pe Tatăl Nostru și promite să se chinuie să facă sentința cât mai agreabilă cu putință. Cineva ca Levine. \n \nLevine a învățat cum stă treaba după ce a petrecut zece ani în închisori federale de maximă și minimă securitate, pentru trafic de droguri, înșelăciune și fraudă în asociație cu o familie de gangsteri italieni. După ce a fost eliberat în 2007, el a intrat în breasla americană de consultanți de închisoare și a stilizat timpul petrecut la pârnaie ca experiență profesională. \n\nCitește și:  Fotografii cu viața deținuților români înainte să intrăm în Uniunea Europeană \n\n \nPare o industrie nișată, dar în ultimii ani, pe net au apărut ceva firme de consultanți de închisoare . E logic dacă stai și te gândești că oricum  crimele mărunte nu s-au dispersat , iar crimele cibernetice sunt în creștere . Elita criminală din Bel Air și Boca Raton au în general capitalul necesar pentru a apela la serviciile unui consultant ca Levine. ( consultanții de închisori de obicei ajung populari doar când se face o captură mai valoroasă .) Jobul lui e să-i informeze cum mai exact o să li se schimbe viața. \n \n\u201eCineva care e prins cu trafic de droguri sau de farmaceutice se poate folosi de ajutorul meu pentru a-și micșora sentința, dar sunt și mai pregătiți pentru că știu cum merge treaba prin oraș\", spune Levine. \u201eDar un tip care lucrează la birou și e obișnuit să primească comenzi și să învârtă sute de milioane, atunci el intră în custodie, pierde orice avantaj și se trezește cu un puștan de 26 de ani care de abia a terminat școala și-i spune ce să facă. E un șoc cultural.\" \n \nLevine a încercat să convingă clienții că practic angajează un prieten bine informat cu o tonă de expertiză legală și o predispoziție spre închisori. El susține că îi liniștește fără înflorituri și speranțe deșarte. Pe unul dintre site-urile lui Levine , poți găsi o introducere a cursului său de supraviețuire în închisoare. Una dintre cele 101 de reguli include: \u201esă nu te bagi în fața altora care așteaptă la telefon\" și \u201esă nu schimbi niciodată canalul de la televizorul fără să întrebi.\" \n \n\u201eEu îi întreb pe oameni despre ce vor să știe, iar când trecem în revistă mai multe lucruri, ei încep să se relaxeze\", spune Levine despre consultațiile lui cu clienții. \u201eEi mă întreabă orice vor să știe, iar lucrurile pe care nu ar trebui să mă întrebe, le spun eu.\" \n \nPe lângă acest serviciu care-i ajută pe baștanii condamnați care urmează să săvârșească sentințe grele, probabil cel mai valoros aspect al lui Levine (și a altor consultanți ca el) este cum să scurteze pedeapsa. Unul dintre cele mai comune sfaturi în sensul ăsta este să profite de programul Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP), un protocol intensiv de dezintoxicare pentru deținuții care se luptă cu abuzul de substanțe, ce promite reducerea sentinței. Evident, programul e destul de competitiv, dar dacă te califici, prospectele unei sentințe mai scurte sunt din ce în ce mai mari. \n\nCitește și:  Un judecător român mi-a spus de ce a luat mită, deși avea salariul de două mii de euro \n\n \nCharles Burke a fost inculpat ca parte dintr-un cartel de fraudă și urma să săvârșească o sentință de 33 de luni. El l-a angajat pe Levine, care l-a educat rapid despre RDAP. Acest program, combinat cu admiterea culpei, i-a redus sentința la 13 luni. \n \n\u201eLarry m-a convins să nu-mi iau viața\", spune Burke, pe care l-am contactat cu ajutorul lu Levine și a cărui mărturie poate fi găsită la secțiunea \u201e Inmate Testimonials \" de pe website-ul lui Levine. \u201eEl mi-a spus: «Cu puțin noroc și cu RDAP poți să ieși cât ai zice pește» și chiar s-a simțit diferența.\" \n \nBurke mi-a spus că în trecut el era dependent de iarbă și alcool. Cu Levine în dreapta sa, Burke a făcut un plan de atac pentru a se califica în programul de reabilitare, încă din prima zi. \n \nUnii din tovarășii lui Burke, care au fost condamnați odată cu el, nu au ajuns în programul RDAP pentru că nu l-au avut pe Levine care să-i instruiască. \u201eAtunci când te vezi cu psihologul în prima zi și nu știi cum să răspunzi la întrebări, poți să fii eliminat pe loc\", spune Burke. \n \nCa să fie clar, Levine insistă că nu le dă clienților răspunsurile corecte atunci când aplică la RDAP, lucru care e ilegal. În schimb, el le explică programul și ce urmăresc cei din consiliul de calificare. Cu alte cuvinte, conform lui Levine, el oferă opțiunile iar clientul alege varianta morală. \n \nExistă un vag sentiment de nihilism capitalist în consultațiile pentru închisoare, care câteodată  pare scos din Vestul Sălbatic , unde rivalii se ațâță unii pe alții, pentru a distruge reputația competiției. Oamenii care apelează la serviciile lor sunt în mare pare bogați și influenți, chiar și în contextul echilibrat al închisorii, ei tot au un avantaj. Într-un fel, Levine și-a construit o afacere pe spinarea celor care-și permit să se întoarcă în libertate și la viața privilegiată, cu doar câteva trucuri. \n \nIndustria nu are nicio prevedere sau regulă, iar tarifele pot varia de la o extremă la alta. Ca client, e dificil să-ți dai seamă dacă ești tras în țeapă sau nu (o mică lecturare de pe prisontalk.com despre consultanții pentru închisoare ilustrează acest aspect). Iar într-un articol New York Times din 2012 despre această industrie înfloritoare , însuși Levine recunoaște că creșterea accelerată înseamnă și că piața \u201ea devenit suprasaturară de persoane care habar n-au ce fac.\" \n \n\u201eEu justific asta în felul următor\", spune Levine despre profesia lui. \u201eAm stat 10 ani, am fost la 11 închisori diferite și în multiple nivele de custodie. Am ieșit fără nimic, dar am reușit să construiesc ceva. Nu am avut resurse, dar am folosit cu cap timpul petrecut înăuntru și a funcționat.\" \n \nPână la urmă, informația înseamnă putere, iar directorii panicați care urmează să pășească într-o lume complet necunoscută sunt dispuși să plătească pentru astfel de tutorial. \n \n Urmărește-l pe Luke Winkie pe Twitter . \n \n Traducere: Diana Pintilie \n \n Citește mai multe despre viața în închisoare: \n\nDe ce e ilegal să te masturbezi la pușcărie   \n\nMi-am reparat mașina într-o închisoare poloneză \n\nCe-am învățat cât am fost frizer în închisoare","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Luke Winkie"},"topics":[],"title":"Tipul ăsta pregătește infractorii bogați pentru ce-i așteaptă în închisoare","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Vice Magazine US","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"349495922","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"954"},"name":"Vice Magazine US","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://vice.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.federalprisonconsultants.com/","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-02/why-white-collar-crime-is-here-to-stay","https://www.ft.com/content/3541a100-1eaa-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122","http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/07/15/madoffs-prison-consultant-weighs-on-inmate-no-61727-054/","http://www.losangelesprisonconsultants.com/prison-survival-tips/fedtime-101","http://www.wallstreetprisonconsultants.com/","https://oig.justice.gov/reports/BOP/e0302/app1.htm","http://www.losangelesprisonconsultants.com/inmate-testimonials/","http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/fashion/prison-consulting-draws-new-crop-of-ex-cons.html","http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=355055","http://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2011/08/04/a-booming-part-of-economy-prison-consulting/#ade364d7ca89","http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/16/levine-madoff-prison-markets-faces-law.html","https://twitter.com/luke_winkie"],"sequenceId":"695200823045","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://video-images.vice.com/articles/588b7d1ed5130f30fbc753ab/lede/1485536683578-1485461451915-1485380620608-levinesun.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 35 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cumberland","zipCode":"04101","state":"Maine","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMTW","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"89"},"name":"WMTW","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmtw.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200842868","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It explains that liposuction and liposculpture can be used to help hone patients bodies to the image they want. \n \nBrooklyn, United States - January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ -- \n \nA Long Island liposuction, cosmetic, skin and laser surgery center has launched a new report on the benefits of liposuction and liposculpture as a way to gently reshape the body. Doctor Rokhsar, who runs the surgery, is at the forefront of research and teaching and lectures regularly on cosmetic procedures. His latest report focuses on how the service can be a way to remove unwanted fat stores safely and gently. \n \nMore information can be found at: http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction . \n \nThe site explains that, unlike many practices, the Long Island cosmetic surgery is not a one pony show. It boasts over 40 lasers and energy based devices in its world class centers in both Manhattan and Long Island. \n \nWhile some centers will seek to sell their services, patients at the New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center will never get a sales pitch. The center will give them a realistic expectation about the outcome of procedures they are contemplating, and from there they can make the best decision for themselves. \n \nDr Rokhsar is certified in dermatology and has completed additional training in cosmetic surgery fellowship. He explains that anyone considering liposuction in the New York area should be sure to ask their doctor if they are board certified in dermatology or plastic surgery. This is because a medical degree doesn't qualify doctors to practice in the field of lasers and cosmetic surgery. \n \nThe new report explains that liposculpture and liposuction remove excess fat from the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, waistline, arms, knees, ankles, calves, cheeks, jowls and neck. Liposculpture offers more precise sculpting through using smaller instruments for the process. \n \nThis works because it relies on tumescent fluid to numb the fat as well as to help liquefy it, allowing the doctor to remove it through small cannulas. It allows for fine sculpting of the body so local patients can better get the shape they desire. \n \nFull details of the Long Island liposuction services available at New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center can be found by visiting the URL above. \n \nContact Info: \nName: Chris Hayes \nOrganization: Virtual Heroics \nAddress: 2440 East 29th Street, Brooklyn, 11235 United States \n\n \nFor more information, please visit http://www.virtualheroics.com \n \nSource: PressCable \n \nRelease ID: 165208 \n \nMedical Course AHA Guideline Pediatric Emergency Respirator Training Launched (Sun 29th Jan 17) \n \nJoplin Carpet Cleaning Low Moisture Pet Safe Odor Service Launched (Sun 29th Jan 17) \n \nHemp Genix Announces Partnership with NutraFuels for Manufacturing CBD Oil Spray (Sun 29th Jan 17) \n \nSatellite Suites Announces Upgrade to ADA Plus 2 Restroom Trailers (Sat 28th Jan 17) \n \n24 Hour Self Storage Launched Online Rental Pay 49445 49442 Muskegon (Sat 28th Jan 17)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"New York metro area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Long Island Liposculpture New York Cosmetic Surgery Melt Fat Report Launched","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RO","country":"Romania"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Free Press Release Center","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169689110","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3252"},"name":"Free Press Release Center","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.free-press-release-center.info"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction","http://www.virtualheroics.com/"],"sequenceId":"695200846024","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The new service is a low moisture method of cleaning carpets that leaves them clean and quick drying. \n \nJoplin, United States - January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ -- \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets, based in Joplin, have launched a new low moisture carpet cleaning service. This new service does not soak the carpets leaving them dry within the hour saving customers valuable time. \n \nFor more information please visit: http://carpetcleaningjoplin.net . \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets is owner operated and the owner, Alan Snider, will personally answer phone calls to ensure customer satisfaction. The website explains that they are the premier low moisture and upholstery cleaners for Joplin, Carthage, and the surrounding area in South West Missouri. \n \nModern carpets can hold up to a pound of dirt per square foot and this dirt consists of dust, allergens, pollen and other impurities. The site states that not only does cleaning carpets restore them to looking their best, it also helps to keep the home healthy and hygienic. \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets help homeowners to achieve carpet cleanliness by using a low moisture cleaning system rather than the traditional hot water extraction method. The hot water extraction method involves thoroughly soaking the carpet leaving it wet for hours, as well as trailing hoses through the home. With this method stains and spots often re-appear. \n \nThe low moisture method `uses patented technology to aggressively agitate the carpet without damaging the fibers meaning that less water is needed leaving carpets dry within an hour. Another benefit of using less water is that carpets are not soaked through and that means that stains do not wick back and re-appear. They use a machine that is self contained and does not trail hoses through customers houses bringing disruption to a minimum. \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets do not use soap and modern low moisture cleaning chemicals are 96% biodegradable, making it an earth friendly option. They also leave carpets with no sticky residue and are safe for children and pets. \n \nThe company also offers services that include upholstery and pet odor. Those wishing to find out more about Crystal Clean Carpets can visit the website on the link provided above. \n \nContact Info: \nName: Alan Snider \nOrganization: Crystal Clean Carpets \nAddress: 2917 South Jackson Avenue, Joplin, 64804 United States \n\n \nFor more information, please visit http://carpetcleaningjoplin.net/ \n \nSource: PressCable \n \nRelease ID: 165209 \n \nMedical Course AHA Guideline Pediatric Emergency Respirator Training Launched (Sun 29th Jan 17) \n \nLong Island Liposculpture New York Cosmetic Surgery Melt Fat Report Launched (Sun 29th Jan 17) \n \nHemp Genix Announces Partnership with NutraFuels for Manufacturing CBD Oil Spray (Sun 29th Jan 17) \n \nSatellite Suites Announces Upgrade to ADA Plus 2 Restroom Trailers (Sat 28th Jan 17) \n \n24 Hour Self Storage Launched Online Rental Pay 49445 49442 Muskegon (Sat 28th Jan 17)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Joplin Carpet Cleaning Low Moisture Pet Safe Odor Service Launched","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RO","country":"Romania"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Free Press Release Center","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169689110","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3252"},"name":"Free Press Release Center","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.free-press-release-center.info"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://carpetcleaningjoplin.net/"],"sequenceId":"695200846299","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kokomo forced Cass into a rash of turnovers, leading to a 17-2 run over the final 4:00 of the second quarter for a 26-19 halftime lead and the Kats went on for a 58-43 win Saturday night at Memorial Gym. \n \nCass coach Jon Kitchel pointed to Kokomo's deep bench as the key to the swing in momentum. \n \n\"The combination of their depth and their athleticism ... that's the result you get,\" Kitchel said. \"We had a team like that a few years ago that we could bring waves of guys in and pressure. It was a lot more fun being on that side of it than it was on this side.\" \n \nKokomo improved to 11-6 following its third straight win. Cass dropped to 9-5. \n \nKokomo coach Matt Moore looked to his bench for a spark after a sluggish stretch to open the game. He pulled four starters less than three minutes into the game at which point the Kats already had three turnovers. \n \n\"I don't think our guys moved on from [Friday's victory over Lafayette Jeff] early enough,\" Moore said. \"When I pulled them, I thought our bench gave us some stability early and then they kind of got refocused. When we inserted some of those lineups back in and brought the press, it kind of broke the game at that point.\" \n \nIn the first quarter, Cass jumped to a 7-1 lead and went on to hold an 11-7 advantage at the close of the quarter. Kokomo had five turnovers and Cass had a 6-0 edge in points off turnovers. \n \n\"It's frustrating when you turn the ball over against a team that's not really trying to trap you. That's something all year long, we've stubbed our toe with,\" Moore said. \"But just to have six the next three quarters was much better for us.\" \n \nKokomo's defense completely turned the game in the second quarter. Kokomo had a 12-0 edge in points off turnovers in the quarter. Ten of those points came in the Kats' 17-2 run over the final 4:00 of the quarter. Keenen Wheeler's dunk off a turnover midway through the run put the Kats in the lead for good. \n \nCass' cause in the quarter was hurt by senior guard Evan Ohman heading to the bench with foul trouble and knee pain. \n \nThe Kats put the Kings away with another big run in the third quarter. Up 36-27 with 3:00 remaining in the quarter, the Kats reeled off a 12-2 run that Ty Sparling and Anthony Barnard capped with back-to-back 3-pointers. Barnard's triple, which beat the buzzer, came off a turnover and made it 48-29. \n \nThe Kats kept a comfortable lead throughout the final quarter. \n \nSparling scored 14 points to lead a balanced Kokomo attack. Brevin Beard scored 13 points on perfect shooting, Jeremy Baker had 13 points off the bench and Barnard had 12. \n \nBaker, a freshman forward, recently moved into a fulltime varsity role. \n \n\"He has a natural [offensive] ability that a lot of our guys don't have,\" Moore said. \"He found gaps [Saturday], he can pass the ball, he just has to continue to understand what to do off the ball and defensively how to play at an uncomfortable level and rebound. Once he gets to that point, and he will, it will take his game to a whole other level.\" \n \nBarnard had nine rebounds, five blocked shots and two steals. Beard and Wheeler had three steals apiece and Trajan Deckard had two steals. \n \nMoore liked how the Kats held the Kings to less than 40 percent shooting. Cass shot 34.1 percent (14 of 41). \n \nAlec Eurit and Kace Kitchel carried the Kings' offensive load. Eurit had 13 points and Kitchel had 11. Eurit had six rebounds and Cohen Nies had six rebounds and three blocks. \n \n\"We competed. We played hard,\" Jon Kitchel said. \"I thought Alec Eurit had a big game. He attacked them. I thought Kace's defense on [Barnard] was good and offensively he was aggressive. \n \n\"They're just a bad matchup for us. I don't know that we'll see anybody like this in the tournament. Hopefully we won't.\" \n \nJon Kitchel said Ohman's knee trouble is a concern going forward. He said the team may ease Ohman's workload in advance of the state tournament.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRYAN GASKINS For the Pharos-Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kats turn up pressure to take down Kings","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Madison","zipCode":"46016","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anderson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Logansport Pharos Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169813836","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"834"},"name":"Logansport Pharos Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pharostribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200907238","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

No, there were no fisticuffs in this one but you could say that each team traded punches throughout the entirety of the contest. When the final horn sounded it was a solid Michigan City Marquette Catholic squad escaping with a 58-55 win over an equally solid Winamac. \n \n\"Rebounding and transition were the two areas that really did us in tonight,\" Winamac coach Kyle Johnson said. \"Many of their offensive rebounds were eventually turned into baskets and that hurt us. I liked how our guys competed and I like how our younger guys came in and did some good things but our rebounding tonight hurt us. But we knew coming in Marquette was going to do that.\" \n \nFrom the opening tip it was apparent that these two teams were going to battle. Both squads were playing a tight man defense while both offenses were looking to attack. In the first quarter both teams were able to claim a four-point lead over the other before the other would come back to tie the game up. At the first break though it was Marquette squeezing out a slim 14-12 lead. \n \nBy the 5:00 mark of the second quarter the Blazers had claimed a three-point lead over the Warriors. A long 3-pointer by Max Willoughby extended their lead to six, their biggest lead up to that point. With their next possession though Winamac's Sam Griffeth answered with his own bomb to again make it a three-point game at 21-18. \n \nMoments later an amazing shovel pass from Jack DeGroot to Calvin Larkin ties the game at 22-22. Then for the rest of the quarter both teams traded blows. A Marquette basket was followed up by a jumper from Austin Brandt to tie it at 24-24. Another Blazer score was then followed up by a pair of free throws by DeGroot to tie it at 26-26 with :24 left before the half. \n \nWith one last chance to claim a lead before the break, Marquette held for the last shot. With time winding down Buddy Jaffee dialed long distance but his shot was off the mark and the teams went into halftime knotted at 26-26. \n \nThe first two minutes of the third quarter is where the Warriors let this one get away from them. Winamac was simply outhustled in transition as Marquette went on a 8-0 run with their points coming in transition. \n \nJohnson called a timeout at the 6:04 mark to re-focus his team and the ploy worked. Coming out of the break the Warriors responded by getting the ball inside to Caleb Smith for two points to end the run. Winamac kept fighting, and moments later DeGroot drained a 3 to get Winamac to within five at 38-33. \n \nFollowing a Blazer turnover Smith drains two free throws to get his team to within three at 38-35. Winamac got to within a single point with :44 left in the third when Larkin too connected on a pair of freebies. Christian Cruz answered the free throws with one from behind the arc before the buzzer to give Marquette a 43-39 lead going into the final quarter. \n \nMarquette opened the fourth quarter similar to what they did in the third by going on a short run. This time a 4-0 start gave the Blazers an eight-point lead before DeGroot would get Winamac on the board again. The Blazers would extend their lead to nine points before Winamac started chipping into the lead. By the :24 mark DeGroot again hits from long range to make it a 54-50 game. Marquette answered with a pair of free throws to go back up six at 56-50. DeGroot again answered with a three to make it 56-53 with :10 left to play. Winamac quickly fouled Colin Kenney and the sophomore calmly hit both free throws to make it a 58-53 game with :08 left. The Warriors final points came with :01 left in the game when Larkin was put on the line for a pair to make it the 58-55 final score. \n \n\"We talked all week in practice about convergence and we did that poorly tonight. We got beat in transition, a lot. They just outhustled us to start the third quarter and that will not happen again,\" said Larkin. \n \nMarquette (12-6) was led in scoring by Willoughby with a game-high 19 points. Jaffee, Chandler Goodwin and Kenney each finished with eight. \n \nWinamac (12-3) was led by 18 points from DeGroot. Larkin tossed in 14 followed by Smith with 10 points of his own. \n \nThe Winamac JV squad also had a battle on their hands in the opening game against the younger Blazers. A close first half saw the Warriors enter half-time with a 22-18 lead. During the break adjustments were made and when play resumed in the second half Winamac began to slowly pull away. By the 1:02 mark of the fourth quarter Marquette had gotten to within five at 46-41. Winamac outscored the Blazers 6-0 the rest of the way to claim the win 52-41 to remain perfect on the season at 15-0. \n \nSam Griffeth led the Warriors with 16 points while Thorn Loehmer pitched in nine and Austin Brandt added eight.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rick Conrad For the Pharos-Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Michigan City Marquette ekes past Winamac","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Madison","zipCode":"46016","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anderson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Logansport Pharos Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169813836","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"834"},"name":"Logansport Pharos Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pharostribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200908268","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:44:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Fragile things are at hazard and some breakage already is evident. One worries just how much damage may ensue. \n \nThe executive orders are coming at a rapid, if scattershot, rate. The Affordable Care Act was up first with nothing definite, but enough to shake the insurance industry with prospects of changes presaging a steep rise in rates for less coverage. \n \nTorture and black site prisons are once again available to the CIA and the Defense Department, if they choose to use them. And Guantanamo will remain as a stain on the national conscience. President Trump also wants a congressional investigation into his fantasy of millions of illegal immigrants voting for Hillary Clinton. \n \nIt was no great surprise that the oil pipeline destined one day to pollute the Midwest was given approval. What was a tad unexpected was his order to cut off all funding for cities that offer immigrants safe haven. To their great credit, dozens of mayors and California\u2019s Gov. Jerry Brown refused to back down. \n \nVery little that the president is proposing can be affected without the cooperation of Congress. House Speaker Paul Ryan agrees with building a great wall, a beautiful wall, on our southern border at taxpayers\u2019 expense. Apparently, we trust that Mexico will reimburse us with pinatas, if not in cash. \n \nI think it\u2019s obvious that the Republican leadership happily will approve the wall with money they can find by eliminating Great Society and New Deal programs. The plans for that already afoot. \n \nWhat worries me most is that we could lose the ability to know exactly what is happening to us and the world. One can discern the outline of a grand strategy making shape in some discreet changes which recently came to light. \n \nWe are told that certain agencies are to cease contact with the public; no exchange of information or press releases. It\u2019s uncertain whether or not this is a blanket order or concentrated on the EPA and other departments which some of Trump\u2019s allies find bothersome. \n \nCoupled with this is an alarming change in the Voice of America, the international radio network set up after World War II to connect with other nations in their own language. About a year ago, it finally was made available to American listeners. \n \nIn the omnibus bill which Obama had to sign to keep the government going, there was a provision which changed the structure of the VOA. It had been managed by an independent board of broadcast specialists. That board was eliminated in favor of a CEO appointed by the president. \n \nThe obvious fear is that what has served as an independent source of information could very well become an instrument of propaganda for the television personality who would love to have his own broadcast system. \n \nI have not tried to delve deeply into this stuff as I am distracted just now by other concerns and, frankly, I am past any real involvement in political action. Age and its attendant inconveniences have a way of asserting themselves when the spirit suggests donning armor and re-entering the fray. \n \nA friend who took part in one of the many women\u2019s marches wrote of her experience: \u201cIt was gratifying to be among the women, men, children, whole families, white-haired grannies, people in wheelchairs and walkers, various colors and shades, Christians, Muslims, Jews, all in solidarity against No. 45 and his ilk. All sentient people need to put their angry wigs on over their thinking caps and save America.\u201d \n \nWell, I could use a wig, but marching is not an option these days, so I read, watch and wonder. \n  \nDon Wooten, of Rock Island, is a longtime broadcaster and former Illinois state senator; donwooten29@gmail.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Don Wooten"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Sifting through breakage from Trump's first week","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rock Island","zipCode":"61265","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Moline","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Quad-Cities Online","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169681602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"221"},"name":"Quad-Cities Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.qconline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200909076","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Martin Luther King\" who was a \"great man.\"\n\nI don't understand how you can accuse Obama of harming the country while professing admiration for Rev. King. Both men were cut by their creator from the same righteous cloth. And both drew the same wrath from the same quarters.\n\nDoug, if you honor King - who stood up to white supremacists and spoke out for fair housing practices, equal protection for the right to vote, equality in public education, equality in job opportunities, and equal justice for all - how can you not honor Obama for working, in the face of intense hostility, to advance those same goals? AHS sub program falls into 'alternative facts'\n\nTo the editor:\n\nI have to say that Jim Hand's Jan. 24 story \"Sub shortage forces AHS to consolidate classes\" tickled my retired high school principal funny bone. Attleboro Superintendent David Sawyer spins what is obviously a desperate effort to cope with a lack of substitute teachers by creating what he calls a \"pilot program.\" His \"pilot program\" is sticking several classes into a single location with minimal substitute coverage.\n\nIn my nearly 40 years as an educator, a \"pilot program\" was a term that meant testing a new and creative educational program with an eye toward later implementing it on a broad scale. Sawyer's \"pilot program\" is not new, creative or educational. Let me tell you what this \"pilot program\" will look like:\n\n* Lesson plans provided by the absent teachers will not be followed.\n\n* Some student time will be spent on social media, texting their friends or playing games on their phones.\n\n* Discipline will be more of an issue than in a regular classroom.\n\n* The noise level will be excessive, distracting students who are working.\n\n* Absent teachers will be forced to spend time catching up with what their students missed in the lesson plans left for the sub rather than in moving on to new material.\n\n* Eventually, this stressful work environment will have the unintended consequence of reducing the number available subs still further.\n\nOne does not have to drive a car 80 mph into a tree to find out what happens. Common sense gives the answer. While I sympathize with Superintended Sawyer's dilemma, he is making the situation worse. I believe that in his heart he must know that, since his justification of his plan to Jim Hand falls into the category of \"alternative facts.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: King, Obama cut from same righteous cloth","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02035","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Foxboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169794068","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"961"},"name":"Sun Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesunchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200910233","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Ted Kennedy. Mike Dukakis. Paul Tsongas. John Kerry. Mitt Romney.\n\nHeck, I've never even seen anyone who eventually because president. It had escaped my memory that one of the most popular players in the pro-am for the Deutsche Bank Championship - the PGA Tour event held annually at TPC Boston in Norton, which this year will be renamed the Dell Technologies Championship - was Donald John Trump, a New York billionaire most famous for his reality series, \"The Apprentice\" and now the 45th president of the United States. Each year, his group drew a big crowd, with many fans pointing at him and saying, \"You're fired.\"\n\nI've been lucky enough to cover the tournament in each of its 14 years, and one year, 2008, I decided to follow Trump around. His group was smaller than usual because, instead of his usual afternoon tee time, Trump began play at 7 a.m. (those early-morning tweets are no surprise, then). He was partnered with one of golf's leading men, Sergio Garcia of Spain.\n\nThe buzz in the crowd was that Trump's trademark hair resembled cotton candy even more than the past.\n\nOne spectator drew a chuckle when she had Trump autograph a $100 bill.\n\nBy 1 p.m., a helicopter buzzed over TPC Boston, the letters T-R-U-M-P on the bottom, its passenger presumably headed back to New York.\n\nIt gave me a glimpse of the magnetism Trump has with many Americans.\n\nTrump owns several courses, some ranked among the best in the world by golf magazines.\n\nHe's also a very good player. Last month, Tiger Woods teed it up with then-President-elect Trump at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nWoods called it a \"great day\" with \"perfect weather\" as he and Trump walked 18 holes.\n\n\"At the time I think we only had, what, 10 security carts,\" Woods said Monday while preparing to play a PGA Tour event in Los Angeles. \"I think his might be increased now.\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump's golf game, Woods commented on Trump's power.\n\n\"For a person who is 70 years old, he hits it hard,\" Woods said. \"People don't realize he's that old and he can rip it and hit it as far as he does. He keeps himself in pretty good shape and pretty good health, and has an inordinate amount of energy.\"\n\nThat's what I remember too. Trump swings hard.

They will contact legislators and the president, write letters to the editor and blog.\n\nMost must know that if the fervor of the event in D.C., replicated around the world, does not translate into action, it will simply become a memory of solidarity without lasting solidity.\n\nSo today is not too soon to think beyond badgering leaders, to the steps required to become one. To run for office. This country is way behind some others in gender parity where the power resides.\n\n\"It's time to get serious about addressing why 51 percent of the population has less than a fifth of the representation in Washington, DC,\" wrote Steven Hill in his piece, Why Does the US Still Have So Few Women in Office, for The Nation in 2014. \"The future of the nation is at stake.\"\n\nHill reported that America ranked 98th in the world for percentage of women in its national legislature, down from 59th in 1998. Compare the U.S. at less than 20 percent to Sweden, for example, with 45 percent presentation on the national level.\n\nQuotas and \"multi-seat districts\" are elements of those successes. Those concepts are too complex for explanation here; still, our woeful record begs review of our processes including the burdensome Electoral College established in 1787 as part of the Constitution.\n\nThat said, the prime impediment to the election of women may not be discrimination by men, as some would say, or our system, but the fact that women do not get involved in the same numbers.\n\nToday is not too soon for women charged up with the momentum of an historic march to look toward next elections.\n\nThere are resources. The state of Massachusetts has a website detailing preparation for candidacy - the number of signatures on nomination papers, for instance, the filing deadlines - and there are organizations that champion women.\n\nEmily's List recruits and helps elect pro-choice Democratic women candidates. There are names on its website of those it claims to have helped to attain office, including Massachusetts women.\n\nThese include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Reps. Katherine Clark and Niki Tsongas, and several on the local level. Every election cycle, Emily's List recruits women interested in running for the first time. You can sign up online for trainings.\n\nThe National Federation of Republican Women recruits and trains GOP candidates. Judy Weis, president from 1941 to 1942, won election to the U.S. House from New York in the late 1950s, and there are other successes noted.\n\nThe death of actress Mary Tyler Moore last week and reruns of her sitcom - a mythical news workplace of the 1970s - were reminder on the heels of the women's march of how far women have come since days when the words \"single\" and \"pill\" were each taboo and, used together, outright inflammatory.\n\nBut there's a long way to go - and the most promising route to ultimate power is as a candidate for election.\n\nBETSY SHEA-TAYLOR, a former editor and writer for , is a freelance writer.

Charlie Baker a bill that will raise the annual pay of House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Stan Rosenberg, both Democrats, roughly 40 percent to $142,000. Raises would also be approved for other Democratic and Republican leaders, and for the chairs of legislative committees.\n\nUnder the proposal, the governor's salary would increase from $151,800 to $185,000, along with a new, $65,000 housing allowance, even though Baker has said he and the lieutenant governor are quite happy with their current salaries, thank you.\n\nThe housing allowance? Massachusetts is among a handful of states that doesn't have an official governor's mansion or a housing stipend, so that would be a nice perk. Except that Baker seems fine with his commute from Sampscott. (Also, Mike Dukakis famously rode the T from Brookline to Beacon Hill every day.) So maybe we could skip that one.\n\nHowever, there would also be salary increases for other constitutional officials in this little post-Christmas gift package.\n\nThe attorney's general's annual salary would go from $130,582 to $175,000 and the state's treasurer would get a boost from $127,917 to $175,000.\n\nBy the way, your local rep won't be getting any extra pay out of this. Under a 1998 amendment to the state constitution, base pay for rank-and-file legislators is adjusted every two years based on the median household income in the state during the previous two-year period. The current base pay is $62,547.\n\nFirst of all, let's stipulate that the salaries for several of these officials have remained stuck at the current levels for years, or decades in some cases. The compensation for the president of the Senate and the House speaker haven't changed in 33 years.\n\nBut, citizens of Massachusetts - who have also seen pay levels stagnate in the years since the Great Recession - may be excused for asking why the haste to bring this measure up in the opening days of the legislative session?\n\nAfter all, a report proposing salary changes was drafted in 2014 by a special advisory panel. It's been kicking around Beacon Hill since then until it suddenly resurfaced in the opening days of the current session, when the Massachusetts public was consumed with news from the new Trump administration and the victories of the New England Patriots. A hearing last week, called on during a vote in nearly vacant legislative chambers, brought the issue up again.\n\nWith more warnings of state budget constraints, fiscal belt-tightening and the possibility of tax hikes in the coming year, lawmakers owe their constituents a better explanation of the compensation increases and more time to comment on them - if only for appearances.\n\nMeanwhile, we commend the local legislative delegation for opposing these unnecessary raises. And we call on Gov. Baker to reject the measure, even though it was approved by veto-proof margins.\n\nIt would at least show the appearance that someone is willing to stand up to Beacon Hill greed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Boston news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"EDITORIAL: Reject raises, for appearance sake","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02035","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Foxboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169794068","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"961"},"name":"Sun Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesunchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200911446","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/f9/5f9c5d75-4e69-5688-900e-900a7c665997/588a7935774b8.image.jpg?resize=300%2C215"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/f9/5f9c5d75-4e69-5688-900e-900a7c665997/588a7935774b8.image.jpg?resize=620%2C445"}],"video":[]}}

Charlie Baker backed them into a corner and gave their opponents a powerful election issue by vetoing pay raises for legislative leaders.\n\nDemocrats in the Legislature dutifully approved the $18 million pay raises in near record time last week, despite budget woes that have resulted in cuts to services such as those for opiate addiction.\n\nBaker had said in advance he would not take a raise for himself, but legislative leaders badly wanted them.\n\nThe governor was largely quiet on whether he would approve raises as they were sailing through the House and Senate, but then announced Thursday night he would veto them.\n\nOf course, the veto will be overturned because rank-and-file Democrats - at least most of them - would never dare buck their leadership.\n\nBut, Baker's action brings more attention to the issue and means the Democrats have to take one more uncomfortable vote on the override.\n\nThe move helps Baker shore up support from the right wing of his party, which often complains he is too squishy on issues important to them.\n\nIt also gives any Republican running for state Legislature next year against a Democrat an axe handle to pummel his or her opponent with.\n\nThe Democrats will be left trying to explain why their leaders deserve a 40- percent raise.\n\nOf course, state Rep. Paul Heroux, D-Attleboro, who tends to be a bit of a maverick on Beacon Hill, was one of the few Democrats who voted against the raises.\n\nHis move could be seen as a vote of conscience, or an attempt to booster his re-election credentials.\n\nBut, there is also the very real possibility that he felt free to tick off his leadership one more time before he runs for mayor and no longer has to worry about what they think.\n\nElsewhere in politics\n\n* Newton Mayor Setti Warren, a possible Democratic candidate for governor, saw the trouble with the legislative pay raises passed this week.\n\nFirst he urged Baker to veto them. Then he called on Democrats to sustain the veto.\n\n* U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, D-Brookline, looks like he is trying to raise his profile across the state. He made four appearances last week rallying support to save Obamacare. Three of them were outside his congressional district.\n\n* Most of the opposition to Gov. Charlie Baker's proposal to tax businesses that do not provide enough health care to their employees came for groups that are usually solidly in his corner, such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts and National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n\nOf course, it was equally unusual for the pro-business governor to ask his allies to pony up more to fund MassHealth, the state's subsidized health care program.\n\nJIM HAND covers politics for .

He's a bully, he bragged about sexual assault, he mocked a person's disability, and he suggested closing America's borders to people because of their religion, among other things.\n\nI have two young children who will someday learn about American history and about our government; they will eventually learn about and perhaps look up to the president of the United States. But I wouldn't want them emulating this particular man. What a shame, I think, that our current president is not, in my opinion, a positive role model for our youth.\n\nAnd yet, there must be something positive we can take from these circumstances.\n\nIt reminds me of my first internship when I was going to graduate school to become a social worker. The director of the mental health center where I interned wasn't the most effective leader. He was a nice guy and a great clinician, but he'd been thrust into this administrative role that he wasn't well-suited for.\n\nStaff meetings never started on time and were generally disorganized. Disagreements between colleagues sometimes went unaddressed and grew into bigger problems. I saw how proper doses of leadership here and there - in the form of making decisions, settling disputes and keeping our meetings punctual - could have made the agency operate more efficiently. By watching our director's example, I gained insight about how not to lead an organization.\n\nAnd so it is with our current president; we can watch his example and learn what not to do. Should one of my children ask me why he personally insults and belittles his critics or why he traffics in half-truths and lies, I'll talk to them about what we can glean from observing his style of leadership.\n\nJust because someone occupies a position of power, I'll tell them, doesn't mean everything they say is true. It's good to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism about one's leaders - and important to get your news and facts from reliable sources.\n\nI'll talk to my children about the importance of standing up for what you believe is right, moral and just - especially when your leader doesn't agree with you.\n\nWhat does success look like, I'll ask them, and how should one go about achieving it? Is it OK to amass wealth if you've done it by cheating others along the way?\n\nI would tell my children to pay closer attention to what a person does rather than what they say. The best predictor of a person's future behavior is their past behavior.\n\nThe measure of a person - and of a nation, really - is how they treat those who are less fortunate. And whether you agree or disagree with your elected official's conduct, the value and importance of your vote is tremendous. These are just some of the lessons we might learn by watching our current president.\n\nUp until now I cringed at the idea that my children might one day spot this president on television and see for themselves that such a self-centered, arrogant man has been elected as our country's leader. But now I realize that it can be a valuable learning experience - about everything from leadership to morality to the democratic process.\n\nBILL ZUCK is prepared to learn a lot.

Charlie Baker called the state's park system a \"really big deal\" and said there was \"no question\" that over the past decade \"the state's disinvested in this stuff.\" He then reiterated his campaign promise to dedicate 1 percent of the overall state budget to the environment. \"We're going to get there. It's going to take a few years,\" he said.\n\nThere is little question that Massachusetts has a revenue problem, not a spending problem, and the nature of Massachusetts is short-changed because of it.\n\nOf this year's $40 billion state budget, filed last week, only .6 percent is devoted to environmental programs - programs like the establishment and operation of state forests and parks, along with programs that protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the lands we live, work and play on.\n\nSpending on the environment needs to be increased to no less than 1 percent of the overall state budget, especially as the White House and Congress prepare to cut spending on America's environmental well-being.\n\nThe last time we spent 1 percent on nature was in 2009. And even though he promised to achieve that 1 percent, last year Gov. Baker actually cut environmental spending by 7 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nBudget cuts are made for two reasons: First, in preparing the budget and figuring out how much they will have to spend, the Legislature makes overly optimistic projections on what will be available through tax revenues throughout the year. When the money fails to come in, shortfalls arise with environmental line-items often most vulnerable.\n\nSecond, once they imagine how much money will be available, the Legislature drafts a budget based on their revenue projections and then employs gimmicks to patch it together. They count things such as funds set aside for rainy day emergencies, delaying on-time payment of bills, selling of state property, and state pensions and retiree health care funds.\n\nThe Legislature then submits to the governor a so-called balanced budget with a built-in structural deficit. The dance continues with the governor then vetoing certain sections of the Legislature's budget, the Legislature then overrides those vetoes, and the governor once again cuts budget items for his agencies to reflect a shortfall in revenue income.\n\nThe second reason environmental and other basic programs are underfunded is because of a lack of actual revenue.\n\nRevenues are not keeping up with costs. We are not overspending, and we have not had any spending increases. As the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center points out, general expenditures are consistently at 12 cents for every dollar the state collects. And that's where they have been since the late 1980s.\n\nThe problem is tax cuts. Cutting programs is always part of solving state financial problems. But we have to realize that we do not do more with less, as the voters demand; we do less with less. Those cuts started in a big way at the turn of the millennium when, in a ballot initiative, Bay Staters voted to cut the state income tax rate from 5.95 to 5 percent. That translates into an annual $2 billion reduction in what the state can spend on the public's health, safety and well-being.\n\nThe Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation has shown that the gap between projected revenue and spending to maintain current services is $800 million. So the problem is on the tax side. Before the 2000 initiative, the state was taking in 7 cents on every dollar earned - now it's around 6 cents.\n\nLast year, the governor's budget recommended $200 million for environment and recreation programs, a cut of $14 million below the previous budget. Those cuts have to stop and the environmental budget must be restored.\n\nIronically, it is one of the smallest parts of the state budget that effects every resident of the commonwealth and is often the first to be cut. It is time for Beacon Hill to get back to 1 percent to the nature of Massachusetts in the budget.\n\nJack Clarke is director of public policy and government relations for Mass Audubon.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JACK CLARKE"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"GUEST COLUMN: 1 percent for nature","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02035","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Foxboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169794068","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"961"},"name":"Sun Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesunchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200912149","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:20:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/1b/61b4a101-f955-571f-85b9-0adc2bd5b74a/58893928973b3.image.jpg?resize=300%2C192"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/1b/61b4a101-f955-571f-85b9-0adc2bd5b74a/58893928973b3.image.jpg?resize=512%2C328"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 38 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200913874","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The world is changing so fast that if my parents were still around, they\u2019d likely be shaking their head. \n \nLife might be easier today, but back then it was much simpler. \n \nMy father was a hands-on guy, as many dads were back in the 1950s and \u201860s. If things needed fixing, you got out the tools and did it. I still put his training to use regularly, although my children\u2019s generation is much more likely to hire to get the work done. \n \nNo disrespect to them -- the huge advances in technology mean it\u2019s next to impossible to do things yourself. Back then, when your car ran bad, you cleaned the carburetor and changed the air filter and spark plugs. Today, cars don\u2019t have carburetors and are run by computers. \n \nDad swore by Sears and Craftsman tools and for good reason. First, they had a lifetime warranty. Then if you bought something from Sears it was easy to get parts through the Sears Parts Store. If there was something you didn\u2019t feel comfortable tearing into, they had crews that would come to your home and repair it for you. \n \nThe parts store here is long gone. You can get some parts at the mall or the Hometown store, but many must be ordered online. Last time I tried to set up home service through a Sears contractor, it was going to take 10 days until someone could look at my hot water heater. Ten days without hot water? \n \nMeanwhile, Sears and K-Mart stores have been closing and the Craftsman name is being sold to Stanley Black and Decker for $900 million. At the same time, the sale was announced earlier this month, Sears said it would close 150 more stores. \n \nWhy does SBD need another tool line? According to industry reports, only 30 percent of Craftsman revenues today come from tools. The rest is in outdoor power equipment, which would be virgin territory for SBD. At the same time the purchase also blocks other potential Craftsman buyers from gaining market share in the tool side of the business. \n \nI'm hopeful the Craftsman name will mean quality under the new owners and I\u2019m still leading the cheering section that hopes Sears can turn things around. \n \nSears is not the company my dad loved, but most companies change over time. He also was a big champion of Briggs & Stratton: lawnmowers, edgers, snow throwers -- he swore by their engines. The folks from Wisconsin continue to turn out quality American-made motors. Many Craftsman mowers have Briggs engines. Buying things Made in the USA always is good advice. \n \nMy dad was good with his hands. Me? I get by. I\u2019m not sure what advice of mine my children will choose to follow. At the rate things are changing, whatever I tell them is going to be outdated by the time they are ready to pass advice along to their children. That\u2019s kind of a shame. \n \nPart of growing up is being able to decide what advice your parents gave you that you should heed and which you should ignore. Parental advice that is quickly obsolete can\u2019t be good for society. Maybe it\u2019s time to focus more on philosophical advice rather than the mechanical/technical challenges in life. \n  \nRoger Ruthhart is managing editor of The Dispatch and The Rock Island Argus.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are.

Here are six things we must stop doingBEING JUDGEMENTALOne of the few sins Jesus repeatedly warns His followers not to do is be judgmental.Despite this, many Christians mistakenly assume that withholding judgment is a form of accepting, condoning and even affirming sin. But judgment from Christians doesn't determine whether a particular belief, action or lifestyle is either wrong or righteous in the eyes of God.PREDICTING THE FUTUREThe Gospel message of Christ's love is often overshadowed by misguided Christians who make predictions and 'prophecies' about political affairs, planetary alignments, environmental phenomena, current events, natural disasters, the Antichrist, End Times and the Apocalypse.POSTING GARBAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIAThe clickbait links, offensive political memes, self-righteous condemnations of others, bitter theological rants, and out-of-context Bible excerpts cause more harm than good.Posting vitriolic, superficial, and offensive content on our Facebook feeds and Twitter accounts doesn't glorify God. Before posting anything, stop and think: 'Is this true, helpful, inspiring, necessary and kind''BEING HYPOCRITICALIt's easy to talk about God, argue theological issues and post about faith issues on all sorts of communication platforms. But in order to follow Christ, we are required to actually put our words into actions. As the old adage goes, we must practice what we preach.Unfortunately, too many Christians talk about Christ's love without actually being loving. Meanwhile, the rest of world witnesses this obvious contradiction and simply stops listening.OVERCOMPLICATING THE LOVE OF JESUSThere comes a point, unfortunately, in the Christian journey when many start to feel bored, unfulfilled and dissatisfied with the unglamorous task of loving others.It's very hard work to follow Jesus. It requires sacrifice, humility, service, patience, forgiveness and lots of love. It can be tempting'and much easier'to focus on specific parts of the Bible that don't require as much endurance, are more flashy, will draw more attention and will instill a greater sense of excitement.So some of us create a 'Christian' platform that becomes our passion. A political agenda, social cause, moral practice or specific theological belief can become central to our faith'overtaking Jesus' command to love others as yourself. Thus, we get people who will practically fight to the death over things such as Calvinism, infant baptism and various other causes and doctrines. In and of themselves these things aren't necessarily bad'everyone has their own convictions about theological issues'but when things are prioritized above Christ's love, it leads to idolization.BEING CLOSEMINDEDThe problems listed above are often caused by being closed-minded not considering, acknowledging or even dialoguing with the infinite amount of diverse factors that exist beyond our own limited experiences.HAPPY SUNDAY ALL.Lalasticlala, mynd44. \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Bad Habits Christians Should Drop","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nairaland.com/3598909/bad-habits-christians-should-drop"],"sequenceId":"695200933236","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But, in my experience, it usually has to do with the person's personality and approach to the job. If you don't fit the culture of the company, it makes it harder for the employees who do fit to work with you. They don't appreciate having to work with someone they don't trust and respect. This leads to teamwork productivity issues that then lead to performance issues. Eventually, the manager has to decide which employee is hurting the connectivity of the team. The weakest link goes. Given that new people are often brought into an existing team who are working well together, you can see why it becomes important to decide quickly if this new employee is capable of meshing with the group. If not, there's no point in forcing everyone to work with her or him. It's smarter to cut the person loose and look for a better fit.These five attitudes are the warning signs the new hire won't last.The following behaviors displayed by a new hire are red flags.1) \"I can do it all.\" When new hires jump in and claim to be the Jack- or Jill-of-all-trades, they send the message they think they are better than the rest of the team. Yes, confidence is important, but a person who claims to be able to do it all comes across like a snake oil salesman. It's better for employees to know their particular expertise and stick to it. Remember, everyone on the team has a specialty. In the first 90 days, new hires should spend time figuring out what each person brings to the team so they can leverage their strengths and offer theirs up to help the team succeed.2) \"You need to work around my needs.\" New hires that vocalize constraints around what they can do and when they can do it are immediately labeled \"high maintenance\" by peers. When new hires give a list of requirements before they'll do the job, they create more work for others. New hires should be focused on learning ways their work can make teammates' jobs easier. The more value someone provides to the team, the sooner he or she is viewed as a vital contributor.3) \"I only talk to people who matter.\" New hires that only seem to get excited when talking to people they think have \"influence\" in the company aren't team players. They're opportunists. When new hires don't show any interest in getting to know the receptionist or someone in a different department, they don't see the value in respecting the contributions of every team member. New hires should be focused on making friends with everyone they meet in the company, because you just never know whom you'll need to tap in the organization for help.4) \"I'm always looking for the next big thing.\" New hires who are already talking about getting promoted and taking a bigger role showcase narcissistic tendencies. The all-about-me approach to their career implies they will do anything to achieve their goal and walk over anyone who gets in their way. New hires should be focused on getting proficient at their new job with the intent to exceed expectations. Doing a job consistently well is the best way to earn the trust and respect that can lead to a future promotion.5) \"I can do the job, but don't expect me to overextend myself.\" New hires who only put in the minimum effort show a lack of commitment to building a mutually beneficial partnership with the employer. All new relationships require some extra effort to help form a good partnership. When new hires don't seem to care about whether the employer is feeling satisfied with their early performance, you can only expect their commitment to the job to decrease. They also can't be relied on in times when extra help is suddenly needed to get the job done. New hires should be focused on not just meeting the expectations of the employer but also finding ways to exceed it. This doesn't mean spending extra time at the office, but rather finding ways to improve their productivity so they have extra time and energy to put toward going above and beyond what is expected.If you recruit employees, be sure to monitor new hires carefully for the warning signs above, and cut your losses sooner rather than later. And, if you are a new employee, be proactive and get help managing your onboarding experience so you can make sure you do well in the first 90 days. Otherwise, you could be looking for another job sooner than you had planned.http://www.corpersforum.com/training-skills/5-signs-a-new-employee-won't-make-it-in-your-company/ \nClick here to read full news..","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"5 Signs A New Employee Won't Make It In Your Company","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552291450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Latest Nigerian News.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latestnigeriannews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nairaland.com/3598759/5-signs-new-employee-wont","http://www.corpersforum.com/training-skills/5-signs-a-new-employee-won't-make-it-in-your-company/"],"sequenceId":"695200935087","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

According to ESPN Stats & Info, Colorado is 7-0 all-time against Oregon at home and 5-0 since it joined the Pac-12.Although the Ducks trailed by a single point at halftime, Colorado found holes galore in an Oregon defense that ranks 13th in adjusted efficiency, perKenPom.com. The Buffaloes proceeded to drop 39 points on the Ducks in the second half, and they followed the lead of senior point guard Derrick White.White finished with 23 points (8-of-16 shooting), 17 of which came over the game's final 20 minutes.Colorado's official Twitter account offered a look at one of White's smooth pull-up threes on a night when he drilled three of four attempts from beyond the arc:White was flanked by a pair of double-figure scorers in the win. Junior guard George King came up large with 13 points and eight rebounds, while swingman Xavier Johnson dropped 10 points and grabbed nine boards.The Ducks, on the other hand, couldn't come up with sustainable offense.Payton Pritchard led the charge with 19 points, and Dylan Ennis added 10, but the Ducks were at a loss for buckets on a night when Dillon Brooks managed nine points on 2-of-6 shooting in 31 minutes.As a team, Oregon shot 38.6 percent from the field and 32.4 percent from distance.Those figures could all be reasons for Oregon to sulk, but as CBS Sports' Jon Rothstein noted, Colorado's 2-7 mark in Pac-12 play shouldn't fool opponents:With Saturday's win in tow, the Buffaloes will attempt to build on the upset and rattle off a third straight win when they meet the Stanford Cardinal on Thursday night.The Ducks will also be back in action Thursday, when they're scheduled to host the Arizona State Sun Devils in a tilt that will present them with a solid chance to bounce back following Saturday's disappointment. Postgame Reaction\"If these guys dial in, they can play with anyone in this league,\" Colorado head coach Tad Boyle said, per the Denver Post's Nick Kosmider. \"There's a lot of basketball left. That's a heck of a team we beat. That's not just a Top 10 team. That's a legit Top 10 team.\"Elsewhere, White told reporters games like Saturday's are\"why you come to Colorado in the first place,\" per Kosmider.On the other hand, Oregon head coach Dana Altman had to reflect on the Ducks' shoddy effort.\"Our execution was awful,\" he said, per The Oregonian's Tyson Alger. \"I don't want to take anything away from Coloradotheir energy level was better than ours.

Hashmi said authorities have told him it was too early to speculate.\n\n\u201cNone whatsoever right now,\u201d the center director said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any lead or information as to what started the fire and what happened. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be a few days, they told us, before they can come up with any answers for us.\u201d\n\nThe congregation\u2019s pastor, known as an imam, was awake in the early morning hours and checked online surveillance of the mosque and found no alarm active and the doors unlocked, Hashmi said. On Jan. 21, someone broke in and stole some electronics, including laptops.\n\n\u201cHe was worried about it and drove over there,\u201d Hashmi said. \u201cBy that time, fire engines were already there pouring water on the fire.\u201d\n\nThe structure was built in 2000.\n\nNo injuries were reported. It took about four hours to extinguish the blaze.\n\nHashmi, who\u2019s lived in Victoria 32 years, said the congregation of about 140 has had few other problems and has enjoyed support from the city of about 115 miles southwest of Houston. He already has received offers of temporary quarters for the congregation to worship.\n\n\u201cWhen 9/11 happened, Muslims and non-Muslims, we all got together,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we will rebuild.\u201d\n\nThe Victoria Advocate on Saturday reported that in July 2013, a man admitted to painting \u201cH8,\u201d a computer shorthand for \u201chate,\u201d on the outside of the building.\n\nOn Jan. 7, a mosque under construction near Lake Travis in Austin was burned to the ground.\n\nThe Texas office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said like that blaze, it would monitor the investigation of the Victoria fire.\n\n\u201cBecause of growing anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation, and because of the recent spike in hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions and individuals, we urge investigators to keep the possibility of a bias motive for this fire in mind,\u201d CAIR-Houston Executive Director Mustafaa Carroll said.\n\nThere\u2019s been no determination yet for the Austin blaze, Diane Kanawati, with CAIR-Austin, said Saturday.\n\nIn December, a man was sentenced to four years in prison for setting fire to a Houston mosque where he worshipped. Gary Nathaniel Moore pleaded guilty to arson and using a fire as a deadly weapon in a Dec. 25, 2015, blaze that caused significant damage at the Islamic Society of Greater Houston mosque.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Deccan Chronicle"},"topics":[{"name":"Austin news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"US: Texas mosque goes up in flames hours afte...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200937201","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/c30a106af7076ab31ab200cbc9b00e88.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I do hope I get a very wise one because I haven't enough time on my clock. the mods can also help me to push this to FP because its my future at stake.I'm in a position where I don't know whether to continue schooling - MSc, or accept a job offer.after my BSc, I didn't want to continue on with my course of study because I realised I hadn't much passion for it, I went in to study mathematics because it came my way and at the time I couldn't say no to an admission. so after nysc, I went in to do a PGD in geography and environmental management. i already had love for the geosciences. came out with a good result that qualified me for a MSc in any of the related discipline. I applied for environmental hazard management and got the admission.at this point things became more difficult with the recession and it is clear to me that I won't be having any support. school fees has increased and the cost of running the MSc has gone high. on the other side, I've been applying for jobs as a HSE officer/manager which I have some years of experience working during the break within my programs. I just missed a job in nestoil because my guy in there didn't act fast to recommend me when there was emergency vacancy. however, because of the disappointment they have offered me a job as a HSE officer in a seismic company. they have asked me to come on Monday 30th January.by calendar I'm suppose to start MSc lectures on the same date. I have drained my brain thinking of what to do....whether to take the job and differ my admission perhaps, or to go on with the MSc and ignore the job for now...I know that a lot of you folks out there have been in a similar situation or you know someone who was. please your advice is needed, I don't want to make a mistake that I will regret...and I just have less than 2 days before the interviews on Monday morning.please mods help me get this to front page.

A hyper-grace church is one that is so focused on Jesus that it begins to look like Jesus, talk like Jesus, and smell like Jesus.To highlight a positive it helps to accentuate the negative. So how do we get it wrong' What are the signs that a church is missing the grace of God'Here are eight of them:1. They are self-consciousThe message you hear is, ' You must nail yourself to the cross every day .' So Christ's sacrifice wasn't good enough' 'You have to cleanse yourself and make yourself holy.' You cannot succeed.A focus on self and the things you must do to stay saved, get holy, and be blessed, is the number one sign you have missed the grace of God. Self says I will, but the gospel saysHe will .Self cannot supply what God freely provides. We don't need seven keys to success or fourteen steps to sanctification. We need a revelation of Jesus Christ and what he has done for us. Christ is our righteousness and holiness from God.2. They're not sure if God likes them'Sure, he's a God of love, but he's also a God of justice. He sends earthquakes to punish cities. He takes away your children. He trains you with sickness and scourging , so don't make him angry.' What awful lies! What fear and insecurity this graceless teaching has brought to those whom God loves.See the cross! If God did not spare his own Son, what won't he do to reveal his love to us' God is not mad at you, he's mad about you!3. They speak (and sing) the faithless language of longingA sure sign that some have missed grace is they ask Jesus to do what he's already done. 'Oh Lord, come down.' He already did. 'Have mercy on us.' Ditto. 'Make us holy.' 'Come and cleanse us.' 'Bind the strong man.' Tick, tick, tick.Or they beg God to do what he never would do. 'Lord, don't leave us.' He said he wouldn't. 'You give and take away .' No, he doesn't.The language of longing is the language of the old covenant. Good news: The wait is over. Christ has come! In him you are home. Everything you need for life and godliness has been provided. So change your tune and learn the new song of the new creation. It's a song of praise and thanksgiving (Ps 34:1, Heb 13:15).4. They are sin-conscious'I'm just a sinner saved by grace.' 'Let's examine ourselves for sin before worshipping.' 'Confess your sins to remain in fellowship with the Lord.' What an insult to the Spirit of grace. If the Holy Spirit chooses to remember your sins no more (Heb 10:17), what business is it of yours to remind him'An obsession with sin is a hallmark of the old covenant, but it has no place in the new. Behold the Lamb of God who has taken away the sin of the world.When you sin, a graceless church will shovel the shame. 'Look at what you did.' They will reach for the stones instead of reaching for the only thing that can empower you to go and sin no more. Hint: it's grace (Tit 2:11-12).5. They are law-minded'The law shows us how to please God.' No it doesn't. 'The law helps you overcome sin.' Actually, the law helps sin overcome you (Rom 7:9). 'God gives us grace so that we might keep his commands.' No, God gives us grace because he loves us.As Paul explains in Romans 7, running after the law is committing spiritual adultery. It's cheating on Jesus. A church that mixes law with grace is lukewarm and nauseating to the Lord.6. They think grace is just for sinners'We are saved by grace, but kept by discipline.' Nope. It's grace from start to finish (Heb 12:2). Grace is not one aspect of God that must be balanced against his other, less gracious aspects. Grace is everything. You are saved by grace and kept by grace. Grace is for everyone. Period. The end. Amen.7. They treat people as resourcesIn a graceless church your value is determined by your behavior. Are you a hard worker' You'll go far! Are you divorced' Forget about it.In a graceless church visitors are valued as potential members, while members are valued as potential leaders. And because there are never enough people to fulfill the vision, everyone is busy, busy, busy. When activity replaces fellowship and friendships become task-based, when children are kept out of the way because they get in the way, real life has left the building.8. They are insecure and anxiousA graceless church is an uncertain church. 'Are you saved' Are you sure' Are you doing enough'' Instead of preaching the promises of Jesus, a graceless church promotes the promises of man. And since we can't keep the promises we make, the result is failure and despair.A graceless church is attractive to the self-righteous but unappealing to sinners. It is a place the zealots call home but the prodigals avoid. It is a place where the sheep are fleeced and the poor are exploited. It stinks of self and it is a terrible advertisement for Jesus.But here's the good news: God loves graceless churches! He loves the mixed-up people inside them and the misguided leaders who run them. I know this because I was a misguided pastor and this list was my testimony. But God has given me a new and better testimony, a testimony of his grace.May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, my friends.

executives and prominent business leaders signed up to advise President Donald Trump. But only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick have so far had the gumption to speak out against the presidentsexecutive orderblocking refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.The order, issued Friday, sparked protests at airports across the nation. By Saturday, a federal judge in Brooklyn had temporarily blocked parts of it.Chief executives of large corporations are nearly universal in their support for increased immigration. Its hard to imagine that any CEO on Trumps advisory panel supports a ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries in principle.But Trumps power and the allure of the presidency are apparently enough to cower the corporate chiefs into staying silent on matters of law and fundamental American values.Musk and Kalanick may have been emboldened by fellow Silicon Valley CEOs, including Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg, who were blasting Trumps ban.Immigration is particularly important in the tech sector, which often looks outside the country to hire talent.The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the countrys challenges, Musk tweeted Saturday night, using the sort of mild language that counts for aggressive in the corporate world.Just days earlier, The New York Times reported that Musk and Trump having a budding bromance.The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 Tesla employs a small number of people potentially affected by the ban. But the company does not believe any employees are being detained, a source familiar with the company told HuffPost. Teslas HR and legal teams are working with the employees who may be affected, the source said.Kalanick, whos faced criticism for his role advising Trump, offered a more detailed response.In an email to Uber employees with the subject line Standing up for whats right, the chief executive said he plans to raise the issue with Trump at the advisory boards first meeting on Friday.While every government has their own immigration controls, Kalanick wrote in the note, which he also posted to Facebook,allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.s policy since its founding.Kalanick said the order would have far-reaching effects at his ride-sharing company. A dozen or so Uber employees are legal residents but not naturalized citizens, and they may not be able to get back to the U.S. if they travel abroad.And thousands of drivers, who are not technically employed by Uber, may not be able to get back in the country for 90 days.That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their familiesand of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time, he wrote.The CEO said Uber would compensate these drivers pro bono over the next three months to help them, with more details to come. Other companies whose CEOs are serving on Trumps advisory council, including J.P. Morgan, Disney, Walmart, IBM, General Electric, General Motors and Blackstone, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Consulting firm Ernst & Young declined to comment on Trumps policies when asked earlier this week. And Boston Consulting Group, whose CEO Rich Lesser is on the council, told HuffPost that he is serving in that role as an individual, not as a representative of the consulting firm.Meanwhile, a virtual whos who of tech CEOs ' those not on Trumps advisory board ' came out swinging on Saturday against the ban.Apple CEO Tim Cook told his employees that the company had already reached out to the White House to explain how bad this order is for employees, according to an internal email obtained by HuffPost.There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterdays immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them, Cook wrote.Earlier this week, Cook reportedly had dinner with Trump adviser(and son-in-law) Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump.Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do, Cook wrote in his note.Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple,was the son of a Syrian immigrant.Syria is one of the countries targeted by Trumps travel ban.Other tech CEOs spoke out against the order on various social media platforms.Netflix CEO Reed Hastingsposted a Facebook message that said, Trumps actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.Worse, he added, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who was snubbed from a recent meeting between Trump and other tech bigwigs, tweeted his disapproval Saturday night.The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. https://t.co/HdwVGzIECt jack (@jack) January 28, 2017 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was born in India, offered up a more personal criticism in a post on LInkedIn. As an immigrant and as a CEO, Ive both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world, she wrote.At least 76 Microsoft employees have visas from the six countries listed in the ban, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote in an email to employees. The company is advocating against the policy.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos hasnt commented, but in an email sent to employees on Saturday, the companys head of human resources offered workers information on how to handle the new immigration policies, while also affirming its commitment to diversity.From the very beginning, Amazon has been committed to equal rights, tolerance and diversityand we always will be, HR Vice President Beth Galetti wrote. Weve worked hard to attract talented people from all over the world, and we believe this is one of the things that makes Amazon greata diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers.Also on Saturday, Google recalled staff to the U.S. because of the Trump order. CEO Sundar Pichai, also born in India, slammed the administrations move in an email obtained by Bloomberg.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a 'caliphate'. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\" Trump said in his executive order.\n\n\"For those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\" he said.\n\nThe plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group.\n\nTrump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls.\n\n\"If ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\" he warned.\n\n\"We know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability.

The terror group is responsible for the violent murder of American citizens in the Middle East, including the beheading of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig, as well as the death of Kayla Mueller, the executive order notes, the executive order said.\n\nIn addition, ISIS has inspired attacks in the United States, including the December 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, and the June 2016 attack in Orlando, Florida, it said.\n\n\"ISIS is complicit in a number of terrorist attacks on our allies in which Americans have been wounded or killed, such as the November 2015 attack in Paris, France, the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, the July 2016 attack in Nice, France, and the December 2016 attack in Berlin, Germany,\" said the executive order.\n\nThe plan seeks public diplomacy, information operations, and cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimise ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology; identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and policies to empower coalition partners to fight ISIS and its affiliates; and mechanisms to cut off or seize ISIS's financial support, including financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Deccan Chronicle"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump gives US military 30 days to prepare an...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200950854","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/4d120bc54c084598714a59660dfcd6ad.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Those who applied made numerous applications to different banks. \n \n\u201cThis suggests that it was more difficult for UAE residents to obtain personal finance last year,\u201d the report stated. \n \nJon Richards, CEO at compareit4me.com, said: \u201cThis could be seen as evidence for the argument that banks were somewhat less willing to give out credit during 2016. With the liquidity crunch caused, in part, by low oil prices, banks have had to tighten their belts, and a manifestation of that is that normal consumers see less easy access to personal finance. \n \n\u201cOn the other side of the coin, with uncertainty in the market, it would appear that UAE consumers are being more careful about taking out credit. \n \n\u201cFor 2017, we might expect to see a similar trend. We may see fewer individuals ready to take out personal finance, and those who do want to take out personal loans may find it more difficult to get approvals,\u201d he added. \n \nThe report also found that despite a decline in the overall number of people applying for personal loans in 2016, the number of UAE residents applying for Islamic personal loans increased by 6.85 per cent from 2015 to 2016. \n \nWith an application growth rate of 17.03 per cent over the course of the year, those looking for Islamic personal finance were also forced to apply for multiple products, the report said. \n \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t surprising, to be honest. Islamic banks are facing the same challenges that non-Islamic banks are. With low oil prices permeating almost every aspect of business in the GCC, banks of all kinds are taking a more cautious approach to lending,\u201d said Samer Chehab, COO, compareit4me.com. \n \n\u201cWhat this means for consumers is that you may have to apply for several personal loans before seeing an approval.\u201d \n \nIn terms of the most popular personal loans of 2016, Emirates NBD\u2019s Salary Transfer Personal Loan for Expatriates topped the list, followed by Dubai Islamic Bank\u2019s Salam Finance product, ADCB\u2019s Simplylife Salary Transfer Loan , Commercial Bank International\u2019s Personal Loan and ADIB\u2019s Personal Finance for Expats . \n \nAlso read:  Emirates NBD expects sharp drop in retail loan growth in 2017 \n Comments  \ncomments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Aarti Nagraj"},"topics":[{"name":"United Arab Emirates news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"UAE residents found it harder to get loans in 2016 \u2013 report","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Gulf Business","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"249322976","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"878"},"name":"Gulf Business","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gulfbusiness.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200956107","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We knock on doors and get rebuffed and curse at life and the human condition. \n \nThat\u2019s until the smart among us \u2018think outside the box\u2019. They will realise that with the right amount of determination, they can make lots of money online. Or, they will ransack through their minds, and find a long \u2014 forgotten passion, which they will convert into something they can do \u2014 even from home. Here are a few people doing exactly this: \n \n\n \nWALTER  AKOLO , 31, FREELANCE WRITER AND INTERNET MARKETE R \n \nI have been working from home since April 2011. I would describe myself as a freelance writer, a blogger, a tech-preneur and internet marketer. My online work is solely based on skills I have acquired throughout my life. I am not a graduate: I dropped out of campus because I couldn\u2019t hack what I had been admitted to study \u2014 landscape architecture. \n \nALSO READ:  The inspiring story of a brave mother who is bring up a girl with cerebral palsy (CP) \n \nGoing by that, \u2018what I studied in campus\u2019 is definitely not commensurate to the work I do. I dropped out of campus to become an entrepreneur. \n \nBut after school, I did look for a job. I did transcription for some startup companies, data entry for different entities (a company, an NGO, and church), sales for a textile company and administration for a car hire company. \n \nWhile working for the car hire, I also did some online work part-time. I resigned when my online income stabilised and was almost outdoing my offline income. The success of it is that I doubled my income in a month. \n \nI don\u2019t feel the need to be employed now. Being a freelancer and businessman was one of the best decisions I ever made. Thank God that online work has enabled me to earn a living, pay my bills and sustain my family. There's great potential online and I believe by 2020 we'll have Kenyans earning seven or more figures per month from it. \n \nIt is my hope to one day own a big online enterprise similar to Netflix, Uber, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the likes; that provide excellent solutions to everyday problems. \n \nIRENE WANGUI, 28, FASHION DESIGNER \n \nI am a fashion designer. I work from home for the most part and outsource some of the work to a production factory. I am involved in every aspect of the design process, from idea conceptualisation, pattern making to the final garment. I absolutely love what I do. \n \nI have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Biochemistry. After graduation, I couldn\u2019t find work. It was then that I decided to recalibrate my life and get a skill that was not employment dependent. I then went to fashion school for three years, and after that started working on my brand. \n \nALSO READ:  I bought land from selling githeri and chapati \n \nAfter my first degree, I did want to be employed. However, the minute I began studying fashion, I knew I wanted to start my own business so that, among other things, I could create opportunities for others. \n \nWorking from home has allowed me very flexible hours. I find this convenient because it allows me to do more. I also get enough time for myself and loved ones. \n \nI intend to continue with what I love, from home, until I can\u2019t do it anymore \n \n. \n \nLUCY ATIENO, 28, ONLINE TUTOR \n \nI work online and from home. I am a single mother of one. Being able to work from home has incredibly given me the chance to earn a living as well as keep healthy parent-child proximity. \n \nI work as an online tutor. That basically means that I teach (lecture) students through a virtual interphase. I teach high school and university students. My specialties are Biology, Chemistry, Psychology and business and management. \n \nI graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Fisheries and Aquatic Science. \n \nMy grasp of the other subjects is based on extensive reading and research. I log onto a website with my credentials where I meet with my students. \n \nAfter my graduation, I experienced a somewhat familiar thing graduates go through \u2014 applying for jobs and getting very few calls. But I eventually landed a position at a bank. \n \nThe pay was not sufficient. That is when I started delving online, looking for alternatives. I resigned when I realised I could make enough money to cater for myself. \n \nCurrently, I am a master\u2019s student, a mother and  my younger sibling is living with me. I also have a nanny. \n \nThe money I make is worth my time because I manage to pay fees and meet all my household expenses. In fact, I even started a new business with the money I have saved from my online work. \n \nAll I need to work is my laptop, steady Wi-Fi connection, and a stable power source. I don\u2019t feel like going back to being employment. \n \n\n \nCAROLINE MWANGI, 30, SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT DEVELOPER AND MANAGER \n \nI finished high school in 2004. My father, a businessman, opened a stationery shop for my sister and I. We did printing, photocopying, binding and typing. \n \nI worked at the business till 2009 when I decided to challenge myself with a new role. I got employed at Sun Beam \u2013 selling cakes and tea. It is a job I diligently held until 2013 when I started my online work. \n \nI work with different clients at different times. As a social media content developer, my work involves creating material that will further my clients' objectives. I know what is right for different platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and such. \n \nSometimes, I manage platforms for clients. I am in charge of their accounts and I make sure that they make the right posts and engage with the online community appropriately. \n \nI mostly handle work on a contract basis. That means my income is not steady but is good enough to pay my bills. \n \nI can work from anywhere, anytime because I interact with my clients online. To accomplish my work I need my laptop, my phone and some internet connection.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"The Counties: I rarely leave home - but I make money","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"KE","country":"Kenya"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"East African Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660745","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"916"},"name":"East African Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Regional","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke","publisher":"The Standard Group Ltd."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200957742","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Obama, 55, went into the White House as a bestselling author for his books Dreams from My Father, published in 1995, and The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, published in 2006.\n\nThe only other US presidents to enter office as bestselling authors are Dwight D Eisenhower, for his 1948 book, Crusade Of Europe, and Donald Trump for his 1987 book, The Art of The Deal.\n\nObama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother, already has three books under his belt: Dreams from My Father; Audacity of Hope; and the children\u2019s\u2019 book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters (published in 2010). ALSO \"There\u2019s no doubt Obama\u2019s memoir will go for more than any president\u2019s has ever gone,\" Newberg told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAfter leaving office, George W. Bush got $7million (Sh728 million) for his 2010 Decision Points while Bill Clinton received $15 million (Sh1.56 billion) for his 2001 memoir, My Life.\n\nBush and Clinton sold 2.6 million and 2.2 million copies of their books respectively.\n\nPrinceton University presidential historian Julian Zelizer told the Hollywood Reporter that he thinks sales from Obama\u2019s memoir will top both.\n\n\"There is broader fascination with Obama, from conservatives who really hate him as well as liberals who deeply admire what he did,\" he said.\n\nObama, who likely will be represented by Washington lawyer Bob Barnett, recently told senior adviser turned CNN commentator David Axelrod that the book is his top priority. He has already hired Cody Keenan, former White House director of speech writing, to help. While every major publisher will bid for the rights to publish the book, Random House, which published Obama\u2019s 1995 memoir Dreams of My Father and 2006 The Audacity of Hope (combined sales of five million), as well as both the Clinton and Bush books, has the inside track.\n\nOne wild card: Obama might find a rival in wife Michelle, whom Newberg predicts will \"easily\" surpass the $8 million Hillary Clinton got in 2000 for her memoir.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harrison","zipCode":"39507","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gulfport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6447"},"name":"Sun Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sunherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200959852","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Stanthorpe Border Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607011204","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Stanthorpe Border Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stanthorpeborderpost.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200962403","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T14:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Chivas, America return to winning ways \n \nWhenever Mexico's two biggest teams lose a game, there is a certain amount of pressure, but both Club America and Chivas followed up defeats last weekend by picking up wins on Saturday. \n \nLas Aguilas started the round of matches in last place in the Clausura 2017 table with question starting to be asked about coach Ricardo La Volpe's future. \n \nIt was recent signing Paraguayan Cecilio Dominguez who impressed the Estadio Azteca crowd on his debut, netting the winner against Veracruz in the 61st minute with a diving header after a neat move. \n \nThis was a game America had to win. Goalkeeper Agustin Marchesin had leaked eight goals in his first three games of the year and had looked slightly nervous, but the clean sheet and three points should steady Las Aguilas moving forward. \n \nOver in Queretaro, Chivas earned a 1-0 against Gallos Blancos thanks to a first half goal from Jesus \"Chapo\" Sanchez, following an exquisite through-pass from Orbelin Pineda. \n \nIt was a fully deserved victory for Guadalajara, with Queretaro was once again disappointing. Gallos Blancos have now gone 360 minutes without scoring a goal and Victor Manuel Vucetich will be worried about his team's lack of punch. \n  \n#PorSiNoLoViste G⚽⚽⚽L de Cecilio Domínguez @ClubAmerica 1-0 @ClubTiburones #J4CL2017  #LIGABancomerMX \n⚽ #SienteTuLiga ⚽ #AbrazadosPorElFutbol  pic.twitter.com/QWxwgYzIth \n- LIGA Bancomer MX (@LIGABancomerMX) January 29, 2017  \n2. Cardona's return to Monterrey's starting XI ends badly \n \nMonterrey coach Antonio Mohamed handed Colombian international Edwin Cardona his first Liga MX start in five months and it ended with a red card in the 22nd minute. \n \nThe debate raged over whether Cardona raised his arm with intentional force to strike Leon's Fernando Navarro, but the 24-year-old gave the referee a decision to make when he didn't really need to. \n \nThe player asked for forgiveness from the fans after the game, but it was the latest chapter in a strange relationship between Cardona -- one paper on of the best players in Liga MX -- and Monterrey. It just doesn't seem to be working and watching it is highly frustrating. \n \nRayados managed to scrape a 0-0 draw against Leon, but Mohamed is still scrambling to put together a side that works as well on the pitch as it looks on paper. \n   \n3. Pressure on Cruz Azul's Jemez as Xolos stay top \n \nMiguel Herrera's Club Tijuana remains top of the Liga MX after racking up its second consecutive 1-0 victory, this time at Estadio Caliente against Cruz Azul on Friday. \n \nA set piece goal from Juan Carlos Valenzuela was enough to take the points in a bitterly fought game with a total of 38 fouls over the 90 minutes and in which neither team was able to really dominate. \n \nMartin Rodriguez's miss in the first half could've changed the course of the whole game, but the bottom line now is that La Maquina is without a win in five. \n \n\"Football is punishing us,\" said Spanish coach Paco Jemez after the match, adding that the result was unfair and that no fan could criticize the effort and performance his team put on. \n \nJemez's take is a perfectly rational way of looking at the game and his team's lack of luck over the last two weeks; it's just that things at Cruz Azul have rarely been rational over the last few years. There will inevitably be talk about crisis and such, as unfair as that will seem to Jemez. \n \nTom Marshall covers Liga MX and the Mexican national team for ESPN FC.

This January has so far averaged 29.1 degrees, which should rise with two more hot days to end the month.  \n \nMeanwhile, Sydney has smashed the previous record for hot nights in January, with four nights (so far) staying above 24 degrees. The previous record was two.  \n \nSydney is on track to break the record for the number of summer days above 35 degrees, with just two more needed to break the all-time record \n \nMr Taggart said this January has been \"almost certainly one of the hottest on record\". \n \nAnd the heat won't end this week. Next weekend is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a \"hotter than average\" February with hot conditions pushing into March.  \n \nJanuary is also likely to end with less than half the month's average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm. \n \nIt's also significantly less than last year when Sydney received 249.8mm during January. \n \nElsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees. Mr Taggart expects that to stretch to 41 days based on current forecasts, close to the state record.  \n \n\"The forecast for the next seven days is pretty horrific,\" Mr Taggart said. \"That heat is completely unrelenting.\" \n \n\"The forecast seems bad for Richmond and Sydney, but it's nothing compared to Moree.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Josh Dye"},"topics":[{"name":"Weather news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"NSW weather: Heatwave, severe fire danger as students return to school","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Environment","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200964475","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In the words of Justice Sykes, in the earlier of the two judgments he delivered: \"In intellectual property cases it is common for the trial to take place in two stages. The first stage deals with liability, and if there is liability, then the second stage deals with the remedy.\" \n \nJustice Sykes then went on to set a September date for the second phase of the trial. \n DAMAGES & ADDITIONAL DAMAGES  \nInterestingly, both \"Damages and Additional Damages\" were awarded to TVJ in this case, notwithstanding the submissions of Queen's Counsel Charles Piper, for CVM, for only nominal damages to be awarded. \n \nIn the view of Justice Sykes, the only legitimate way for CVM to have gained access to the material used in its 'Return to the Nest' programme, and in other infringing uses, was by paying for a licence from TVJ. \n \nHaving, therefore, considered the expert evidence of Oliver McIntosh, CEO of SportsMax, as to how such licences were priced and marketed in the industry, Justice Sykes then went on to hold that CVM was to pay TVJ US$85,975.00 by way of damages. \n \nThe sum in question represented a 50/50 share of the US$172,750.00 cost paid by TVJ for the rights in question and to bring them to Jamaica. \n \nJustice Sykes then went on to award \"additional damages\" in favour of TVJ. \n \nIn Paragraph 51 of the judgment, Justice Sykes states: \"Section 32 (2) of the Copyright Act, permits an award of additional damages having regard to (a) the benefit accruing to the defendant; (b) the flagrancy of the infringement and (c) all other material considerations. It is this court's considered opinion that additional damages are in order. The conduct of CVM can properly be described as deliberate and calculated risk taking.\" [emphasis added] \n \nIn the view of Justice Sykes, CVM's breach of TVJ's rights in the World Championships programme went beyond a mere breach. It was flagrant. \n \nThe words of Sykes at Paragraph 65 of the said judgment are particularly strident: \n \n\"The Return to the Nest programme made no pretence at reporting current events. It was not a news programme. It was an audacious taking and using of exclusive licence-protected material, which continued despite verbal and written complaints from TVJ ... . It was deliberate, calculated risk taking. There was no deceit. There was no dishonesty. Nonetheless, the breach was flagrant. [emphasis added] \n \nHaving determined that CVM's breach was flagrant, Justice Sykes, therefore, went on to award US$40,000.00 in additional damages to TVJ. \n COSTS  \nGeorgia Gibson Henlin, Queens Counsel, who represented TVJ, also persuaded the court with her submissions on costs. \n \nAlthough TVJ had not succeeded in every single instance of breach claimed, Gibson-Henlin argued that there should be no deduction of costs for failure on some issues, but rather, that full costs should be awarded to TVJ since it had won \"the lion's share\" of the issues and was the party that had been ruled entitled to damages. \n \nWhile Justice Sykes agreed with Henlin-Gibson that TVJ was entitled to full costs, he fell just short of ordering same as the judge ruled that an additional day had been added to the second phase of the trial because TVJ had failed to organise itself in a particular instance. \n \nWhile CVM has appealed the judgments, the case represents a treasure trove for media practitioners, intellectual property lawyers, and generally, for anyone who republishes copyrighted material. \n \nKudos to Justice Sykes for his industry in concluding the two phases of the trial quickly and delivering written judgments. \n \n - Shena Stubbs is an attorney-at-law and legal commentator.

Even his mild, outbursts of temper on the golf course are endearing. \n \nThey mainly consist of him slapping his thigh or talking severely to his golf ball in the royal 'we.' By far his biggest fault is a tendency to be fidgety and too deliberate when making on-course decisions but not as soon as he decides to hit his shot.  \n \nOnly 500-players worldwide can make a comfortable living playing golf professionally. At the increasing rate that 20-year olds burst their way onto the scene these days, it means that the old guard are pushed off the edge of the cliff more quickly than ever before. \n \nThat's good up to a point but it's not all good. A lack of familiarity due to shorter careers damages the marketability of the game. Fans have been known to turn off their TVs if they see too many unfamiliar faces on leaderboards. \n \nWe all like a bit of familiarity. Besides, and far more serious and threatening is the fact that there is a growing trend that more and more coverage of 'everything' is moving to YouTube channels on larger screens. \n \nThat means a massive shift from domestic TV to the likes of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube. It would make you wonder where all the sport on TV, let alone golf, will be seen in our homes in 10-years time? \n \nDo you think I'm exaggerating? Anyone remember Ceefax? There was a time when I relied entirely on Ceefax for my up-to-the-minute sports news. Where's Ceefax now? We are where we are and it is what is! \n \nWhen fans watch golf these days, they can reach for their smartphone to see what is being said on Twitter or Facebook about what is being played out right before their eyes. I remember a time when TV was black and white. I can remember when there was no TV, for heavens sakes. \n \nTechnology is changing people's habits at a dizzying rate. If audiences are finding new ways to watch sport, the advertisers and sponsors will follow. If golf as we know it disappears from out TV screens where will the mega bucks that drive the pro tours come from? \n \nLeaving the pro game aside, golf\u2019s future seems uncertain. Club membership numbers are shrinking and golf courses are closing. Jordan and Rory could be among the game's last superstars. \n \nMany experts whine that the golf ball has contributed to making the game too hard, too expensive and too slow (because it takes so long to complete 18-holes.) The golf industry (as it likes to call itself) responds with silly gimmicks like foot golf, enlarged cups and simulators. The game is difficult, pricey and time-consuming but there is a more insidious danger; one that has infiltrated every aspect of our lives and it is bad for us! It\u2019s the Internet! \n \nThis may seem like a curmudgeonly argument, but take a moment to consider the extent to which the Internet has invaded every facet of our lives. What\u2019s the first thing that many of us do when we get up in the morning or before we go to bed? \n \nWhen we are waiting for something, which could be anything, a cup of coffee or watching our children (Or grandchildren) at play? Mobile Internet access is destroying the most vital traits necessary for living let alone golf: patience, concentration, focus and the willingness to interact with others. A lot of golf is played with 'others.' \n \nEveryone has become more impatient, more distracted, and more self-absorbed. Is it any wonder that young people say they are not interested in golf? The idea of walking around in the fresh air for four hours (often with strangers) without using one's phone freaks them out. \n \nWhy would anyone \u201cwaste\u201d that much time when there is so much to be done? \n \nIn Nicholas Carr\u2019s chilling book, The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to our Brains, he argues that the Internet is rewiring our neural pathways and we are experiencing the world differently from our predecessors. \n \nSpecifically, we\u2019re conditioned to crave instant gratification, distraction, and artificial light. Such habits are leading us away from a scary place (like golf) where silence isn\u2019t golden and nothing is worth waiting for. In today's age, it's hard for 20-somethings to avoid social media that makes them temperamentally unsuitable for golf. \n \nIt's scary that I have no idea how something I am passionate about 'saving' can cope with social media and technology. \n \nLet me finish by repeating something I wrote here a few weeks ago: I have seen too many industries put out of business during my lifetime due to 'new technology' and I fear that it will be the fate of the game that I love within two generations too. \n \nIt won't be the technology of the game's equipment that will apply the final blows but the technology of the Internet and all that comes with it. \n \nWords of the Wise \n \nWhenever there is a carry offered, two things are essential. First, there must be a way around the obstacle for those who are unwilling to accept the risk, and there must be a reward awaiting those who take the chance successfully. Without an alternative route the situation is unfair; without reward, it is meaningless - Bobby Jones.  \u2028","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Ivan Morris \u2013 Golf's future seems to be uncertain","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Limerick Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169816942","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Limerick Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.limerickleader.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200972642","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The other teenager, a 15-year-old boy, was found not to have taken part in the killings and was given a nine-month curfew order.\n\nImage copyright South Wales Police Image caption Frank Lewis had a previous conviction for torturing a sheep The incident left sanctuary owner Teresa Ahmad and her volunteers heartbroken.\n\n\"The ones they took were old cats,\" said volunteer Nicky Morgan.\n\n\"They didn't even have teeth, so they couldn't have defended themselves against what was happening.\"\n\nBut the sanctuary was consoled by the \"overwhelming amount of public support\" and the response to a GoFundMe page which collected almost £20,000.\n\n\"I've seen the best of humanity and the worst of humanity all in a short space,\" said Ms Ahmad.\n\nSix months on she said: \"I don't feel that we have won. \n\n\"I attended court on Monday and I'm relieved he's in custody and that he was handed quite a lengthy sentence.\n\n\"But I just feel so sad because the cats aren't here and we can't bring them back.\n\n\"Everyday we think of how they suffered and what they must have gone through.\" Image caption The surviving cats were found in a cage in a field behind the sanctuary Image caption The cat on the right was a survivor.

This is our modest way of reflating the Lagos economy, creating jobs and getting our youths gainfully occupied. Those of you here today, the first beneficiaries of this initiative, will be the agents through which our country can overcome its current economic challenges \u201c. \n \nAlso on Thursday, the state government launched a mobile app called Citizens\u2019 Gate. The purpose of the app is to help citizens better interact with their government via an online platform and remove the need to want to visit the physical office of any government establishment. \n \nCommissioner for Science and Technology, Mr. Olufemi Odubiyi, who made the announcement at a press conference said the platform would make it easier to make suggestions to the government and communicate their concerns.

Like I have always said, we have an end to white collar jobs, so the future and now is for those who are creative, innovative and those who can use their energy and talent to create employment \u201c. \n \nGovernor Ambode said that the creative industry is an asset to any state and Lagos would continue to support and encourage the growth of its own. \n \n\n \nAlso in the course of the week, the state government began the process of awarding contracts for the construction of 181 roads in the 57 local governments of the state, as promised by the governor last week. \n  \nFollow @ynaija on Twitter \n -- \n  Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tolu Omoyeni"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Local government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Eye on Ambode: Lagos governor presents over N1bn to 705 beneficiaries of ETF, more","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"YNaija.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"561999471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"956"},"name":"YNaija.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ynaija.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://citizensgate.lagosstate.gov.ng/#/","https://twitter.com/ynaija"],"sequenceId":"695200975575","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Hunt Dumont to set aside the verdict and have a new trial ordered. \n   \nAfter a two-month civil trial, Bailey was awarded $50,000 in damages and an additional $37,403 on Tuesday, Dec. 20, to cover lost wages when she took a nine-month leave of absence in 2014 after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, after a Morris County civil jury found that she had suffered emotional distress and was a victim of harassment because of her gender by higher ranking officers in the department. \n   \nBailey received a separate check for $40,000 from the township to cover lost wages in 2014. \n   \nHarrison claimed in his motion that the jury was incorrectly told by the judge that Bailey had participated in three counts of \"protected activity\" under New Jersey Law Against Discrimination . \n   \nTwo of the instances were separate conversations in 2010 and 2011 between Bailey former Randolph Police Chief Robert Mason in which she said it was unfair that female officers be penalized for using sick days to take care of sick children at home according to court documents. \n   \nThe conversations took place after Bailey was passed over for a promotion to sergeant in consecutive years. \n   \nThe third instance was Bailey's continued efforts to seek that promotion while she maintained a good faith despite her belief that gender discrimination existed within the department. \n   \nAttorneys Richard Murray and Omar Lopez, who represented Bailey in the trial, have opposed Harrison's motion. \n   \nAccording to court papers, Murray said that Harrison \"failed to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that there has been a miscarriage of justice that warrants a new trial.\" \n   \nIn the court papers, Murray argues that Dumont's legal charge to the jury and on the verdict sheet were correct, despite Harrison's claims. \n   \nHarrison wrote that the three acts and evidence in the trail did not establish protected activity under Law Against Discrimination and that the only protected activity was the filing of the 2012 lawsuit. \n   \nHarrison claimed that Bailey's supervisors did not treat her any differently than they would treat any of the male police officers in the department and called witnesses at the trail to support his claim. \n   \nThe verdict sheet did not specify which actions of the ranking officers originally named as defendants by Bailey were found to be offensive or discriminatory towards Bailey and resulted in the award. \n   \nBy the end of the trial, Randolph Township was the sole defendant in the case although when she originally filed the lawsuit in 2012, Bailey had sued Mason, current Randolph Police Chief David Stokoe, Lts. William Harzula and Christopher Giuliani and former Township Manager John Lovell. \n   \nIn the trail, Bailey alleged that she had been passed over for the promotion to sergeant because of her gender and that after questioning Mason about the results of her sergeants exams, which she did not pass, she was intimidated by Mason. \n   \nShe testified that Mason pressed his body up against hers and that she was the target of internal affairs investigations and corrective action mandates, which she alleged were not endured my male officers on the force. \n   \nDuring the trial, the jury found that Bailey did not prove that she should have been promoted to sergeant. \n   \nA date has not yet been set for the judge to hear Harrison's motion for a new trial.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Randolph Police Department files motion for new trial in discrimination case","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morris","zipCode":"07970","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Mount Freedom","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Randolph Reporter","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175680066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Randolph Reporter","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://newjerseyhills.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.randolphnj.org/","http://www.randolphnj.org/POLICE","http://www.nj.gov/oag/dcr/law.html#LAD"],"sequenceId":"695200976121","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Museveni, the servant who despises his employers -- Uganda's citizens . \n \n[Uganda: Commentary] \n \nThis week at a televised event to celebrate the 31-year anniversary since the day he and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) seized power, Uganda's ruler Gen. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni angrily declared to the citizens that \" I am not your servant .\" \n \nIn an electoral democracy, which Uganda is constitutionally, the nation's leader is indeed a servant of the citizens and is supposed to serve at the pleasure of the voters. \n \nGen. Museveni knows that as president of Uganda, not only is he a servant, he's the most senior, or supreme servant, as head of the government comprised of junior servants. \n \nGen. Museveni is well aware of this as fact; one need only recall his own words from 1986 when he first seized power to confirm this: The sovereign power in the land must be the population, not the government. The government should not be the master, but the servant of the people. \n \nSo, why would Gen. Museveni now suddenly declare to Ugandans that \" I am not your servant ?\" \n \nIs Gen. Museveni finally telling Ugandans openly what the citizens know anyway? That he is in fact a military ruler and that the constitution, the political campaigning, the election, the swearing-in, are all mere formalities or window dressing? If that's the case, he should explicitly state so and allow the citizens to decide on how to also openly confront that reality. \n \nPerhaps Gen. Museveni has had some sleepless nights, bothered by the many challenges to his legitimacy since there is reportedly strong evidence that he and hand-picked election commission chair Badru Kiggundu rigged last February's presidential election? \n \nUgandan election observers, the observer teams from the European Union (EU) and the Commonwealth, and even Gen. Museveni's primary foreign benefactor, the United States, did conclude that the February 18, 2016 vote was not free, fair, or credible. Dr. Besigye even invited an election audit which Gen. Museveni has rejected. \n \nSo perhaps Gen. Museveni is acknowledging that he's not the legitimate president, and therefore can't possibly be Uganda's supreme servant, since the vote was rigged. Dr. Kizza Besigye and the millions who voted for him as flag-bearer of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) party have been saying this all along. \n \nOn the other hand, if Gen. Museveni still means something else when he states \"I am not your servant,\" might he be admitting that he has not lived up to the compact with Uganda's citizens, when he took the presidential oath and oath of allegiance last year and after previous elections? \n \nGen. Museveni did declare, while holding the holy bible, that \"in the name of the Almighty God\" he \"solemnly\" affirmed to \"faithfully exercise the functions of the President of Uganda\" and \"uphold, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and observe the laws of Uganda\" and also \"promote the welfare of the people of Uganda.\" \n \nClearly, Gen. Museveni has not lived up to the presidential oath and oath of allegiance . Let's consider one instance where he's clearly violated the oath of office and constitution since his last swearing in on May 12, 2016. \n \nGen. Museveni promised to \"promote the welfare of the people of Uganda\"; yet, the nation's armed forces on November 27, 2016 stormed the palace of King Charles Wesley Mumbere, hereditary ruler of Uganda's Rwenzuru people resulting in many deaths . Reports of those killed range from 60 to over 100; this was not promoting the welfare of Ugandans. \n \nGen. Museveni knows that violating the presidential oath of office and the constitution is treason. Yet, ironically, it was Gen. Museveni who ordered King Mumbere arrested, locked up, and charged with treason. (He also ordered Dr. Besigye arrested and charged with treason for declaring that it was he who won the 2016 presidential election ). \n \nSo if by saying \"I am not your servant\" because Gen. Museveni either knows he did not win the elections or because he has violated the constitution since he took the oath of office, then he may have a point. Only a legitimately elected citizen can be president of Uganda; and country's supreme servant. (Citizenship is a sensitive topic that will not be discussed today). \n \nYet perhaps Gen. Museveni means something else when he asserts he's not a servant; the nation's economic well-being? In addition to him swearing on the bible to \"promote the welfare of the people of Uganda\" he has also on numerous occasions, unsolicited, vowed to lift Uganda to \"middle income\" status. \n \nOf course a good servant of the people would deliver on a promise to improve the standard and quality of living of the citizens. One such servant who kept that vow was Lee Kwan Yu, the late prime minister of Singapore.  He ruled from 1959 to 1965, before the country was independent or separated from federation with Malaysia; he continued in power from 1965 to 1990. \n \nWhile nominal income measures for countries, unadjusted for standards of living or for net-foreign economic interactions, are not the best barometers, they still provide some useful insight into a country's economy. \n \nIn 1965, Singapore's estimated nominal gdp per capita was $500 (World Bank); by the time Lee Kwan Yu retired in 1990 it was $12,766 (IMF), almost 26 times more. The prime minister and his ruling party transformed Singapore from a low-income to wealthy country. \n \nWhen Gen. Museveni seized power in 1986, Uganda's nominal gdp per capita was $342 and 30 years later in 2016 it was $623 (IMF); less than 2 times more. (Even if Gen. Museveni's economists come up with rosier statistics they will never come anywhere close to Lee Kwan Yu's accomplishments). \n \nSo, when Gen. Museveni declares to Ugandans \"I am not your servant,\" perhaps he's conceding what the citizens already know; that he will never serve them the way Lee Kwan Yu did the citizens of Singapore. \n \nGen. Museveni might claim that it's unfair to compare his performance with that of the leader of an Asian Tiger -- this is the term used to refer to the first newly-industrialized countries that in addition to Singapore included Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. \n \nIn that case, consider Ghana's performance then: When Museveni seized power Ghana's nominal income was $711 (IMF); today it's expanded by nearly 2.5 times to  $1,551 and Ghana is a low middle-income country. (The World Bank defines lower middle-income countries as those whose average income ranges from $1,026 to $4,035; in East Africa the only other country that meets the measure is Kenya at $1,522). \n \nIn truth, Gen. Museveni knows that he will never transform Uganda into a middle-income country. While campaigning for the 2016 vote  he promised voters free hoes to till the soil. How would Uganda transform into middle income in Gen. Museveni's lifetime while offering hoes to his citizens in the 21st century? \n \nGen. Museveni, in his burst of megalomania --which has been frequent-- also added, \"I am just a freedom fighter; I am fighting for myself, for my belief; thats how I come in.\" In his mind, he is engaged in a personal feud with Gen. Idi Amin and President Milton Obote, two rulers who are now both dead and who were deposed in 1979 and 1985, respectively.  At least he was honest in conceding that his involvement in the freedom struggle was never about Ugandans; it was, in his words, \"for myself.\" \n \nGen. Museveni also said: \"If anybody thinks you gave me a job, he is deceiving himself. I am just a freedom fighter whom you thought could help you also.\" This statement clears up another critical issue; the source of his wealth. \n \nOrdinarily, full-time leaders are paid by the treasury from funds from the citizens; the tax-payers, who employ the president. Since Gen. Museveni does not own proprietary intellectual property, such as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, or Jeff Bezos's Amazon, he has opened himself up to speculation. Unless he offers clarification, Ugandans may wonder whether embezzled state funds or loot from the Congo may account for his fortune. \n \nGen. Museveni's declaration that \"I am not your servant\" should not be taken lightly. \n \nIf he claims he's the legitimate president, there's no debate he is a servant; albeit, a bad servant who has refused to be fired, by  constantly rigging elections and rejecting the will of the voters; his employers. \n \nOn the other hand, if Gen. Museveni is admitting he's not the legitimately-elected president of Uganda, then he's right to confess that he's therefore not the country's supreme servant. \n \nHe would then have to explain why he's in State House.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Singapore news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Uganda news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Gen.

British Prime Minister Theresa May signed a $125 million fighter jet deal with Turkey on Saturday (28/01) and briefly cautioned Ankara on human rights following last year's failed coup, in a visit squarely aimed at boosting trade between the NATO allies. \n\nMay, in Turkey a day after meeting with United States President Donald Trump in Washington, avoided criticizing his sweeping ban on people from certain countries seeking refuge in the United States. She visited both countries for the first time as prime minister, promoting trade deals that would strengthen her hand in talks to leave the European Union. \n\nSpeaking to reporters at the presidential palace in Ankara alongside President Tayyip Erdogan, May called Turkey one of Britain's oldest friends and touched on human rights, a sore point for Erdogan, who accuses the West of not showing enough solidarity following a July 15 military putsch attempt. \n\n\"I'm proud that the UK stood with you on the 15 July last year in defense of democracy and now it is important that Turkey sustains that democracy by maintaining the rule of law and upholding its international human rights obligations as the government has undertaken to do,\" she said. \n\nRights groups and some Western politicians have been more critical. More than 100,000 people have been sacked or suspended following the failed coup and some 40,000 jailed pending trial. Ankara says the measures are needed to root out supporters of the putsch. \n\nAt a joint news conference later with Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, May was asked more than once about Trump's sweeping ban on people seeking refuge in the United States. She said Washington was responsible for its own policies on refugees. \n\nMay had previously said the nature of the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States meant the allies could speak frankly to each other when they disagreed. \n\nIn her Turkey visit, as in the United States, it was clear her priority was on securing trade. She said the UK and Turkey had agreed to form a joint working group for post-Brexit trade and would step up an aviation security program. \n\n'Open for Business' \n\nThe two countries signed a defense deal worth more than 100 million pounds ($125 million) to develop Turkish fighter jets. \n\nMay said the deal, which involves BAE Systems and TAI, or Turkish Aerospace Industries, working together to develop the TF-X Turkish fighter program, showed \"Britain is a great, global, trading nation and that we are open for business.\" \n\nYildirim said the two countries plan to sign a free-trade deal once Britain leaves the European Union, while Erdogan told reporters that he discussed steps towards defense industry cooperation with May, and that he hoped to increase annual trade with Britain to $20 billion from $15.6 billion now. \n\nMay's government is keen to start laying the groundwork for bilateral trade agreements for when Britain leaves the European Union, a process that will take at least two years after triggering the formal divorce talks by the end of March. \n\nThe United Kingdom was the No. 2 destination for Turkish exports in 2015, buying $10.6 billion in goods, according to IMF trade data. Only Germany imports more from Turkey. \n\nThe countries also discussed the fight against militant groups. Yildirim said he requested legal action against supporters of the coup, who he said are active in Britain. \n\nReuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Human rights news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Middle Eastern business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"In Turkey Visit, Britain's May Pushes Trade, Mentions Human Rights","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"ID","country":"Indonesia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jakarta Globe","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"169658055","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Jakarta Globe","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thejakartaglobe.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://jakartaglobe.id/news-international/turkey-visit-britains-may-pushes-trade-mentions-human-rights/#show-hide","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/human-rights","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/bilateral-trade","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/turkish-president-tayyip-erdogan","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/british-pm-theresa-may","http://jakartaglobe.id/tag/turkey-coup","http://jakartaglobe.id/international/british-lawmakers-urge-may-tackle-trump-climate-change/","http://jakartaglobe.id/international/redefining-special-relationship-trump-may-talk-trade/"],"sequenceId":"695200978792","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:00:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img.thejakartaglobe.com/2017/01/2017-01-28T160335Z_638962338_LR1ED1S18LKET_RTRMADP_3_TURKEY-BRITAIN-1024x700.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 35 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Chatham","zipCode":"31405","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Savannah","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WJCL.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607684195","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WJCL.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wjcl.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200981455","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Pichai in an e-mail to staff said the ban on foreign nationals will hit at least 187 Google employees. \n\n\"We're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,\" the Wall Street Journal quoted Pichai as saying in the email. \"It is painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\" he said. Google has recalled around 100 of its affected staff from overseas, the BBC reported. \n\n\"Our first order of business is to help Googlers who are affected,\" he said. \"If you re abroad and need help please reach out to our global security team...We wouldn't wish this fear and uncertainty on anyone and especially not our fellow Googlers,\" Pichai wrote. \"In times of uncertainty, our values remain the best guide.\" \n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella also spoke out against the ban, saying in a LinkedIn post, \"As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic.\" \n\nNadella also shared an internal memo from Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, whose memo said, \"As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called \"Dreamers\". We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\" \n\nNadella, until recently, had said he wasn't perturbed by Trump's warning on US jobs. \n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, in a strong internal memo said, \"In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration -- both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\" \n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also expressed concern over Trump's decision to severely limit immigrants and refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries, saying America is a nation of immigrants and should be proud of it. \n\n\"Like many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,\" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. \n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey called the order \"upsetting\" in a tweet. \n\nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting.

That means this ban will impact many innocent people\u2014an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump's first business advisory group meeting.\" \n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings in a Facebook post called the order \"Un-American.\" \n\n\"Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\" \n\nOn Friday, Trump ordered \"extreme vetting\" of people entering the US from seven Muslim-majority countries including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. The controversial move, signed a week after he was sworn- in as the President, fulfills the vow Trump made on the campaign trail to limit Muslim immigration to the US. On Saturday, a Federal judge passed an order to temporarily block parts of the ban following chaos and protests at airports, providing some relief to stranded immigrants. \n\nImmigrants make up much of the workforce in Silicon Valley, including many executive roles, and the tech industry has long advocated for more open immigration laws in the US, saying they need more skilled foreigners to fill technical jobs. \n\nThe new restrictions will have a major impact on American technology companies that hire skilled staff from all over the world on special H1-B visas, mostly used by Indian IT firms. \n\nWith PTI inputs \n\nMORE:  Business   Donald Trump","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Other Tech CEOs Slam Trump On Immigration Ban....","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Huffington Post India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"548514509","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24465"},"name":"Huffington Post India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.huffingtonpost.in","publisher":"The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Incorporated"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://t.co/HdwVGzIECt"],"sequenceId":"695200982495","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Lots of local players, which is good, and they\u2019re contributing pretty well to the team, so I\u2019m happy to continue down that path, but that\u2019s obviously going to take a bit of time because they\u2019re all young. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a longer path, or you could go down the path of trying to entice some Matildas here, which obviously costs you more money.\u201d\n\nDeans said there was a clear correlation between spending and success in the W-League, where Canberra, Perth, Sydney FC and City finished in the top four.\n\n\u201cI think Perth would spend a little bit less than others, but definitely I think the top three would be Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come back to us who are probably at about 50 per cent of the cap.\n\n\u201cI enjoy trying to develop our own players, but I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that when we come up against a team, like on Friday night, that\u2019s got five or six Matildas and four internationals, you\u2019re going to be a fair way off the mark.\u201d\n\nDeans, who is keen to coach the team next season, said the NNSWF-run Emerging Jets program was also a factor in determining how to operate the W-League side. \n\n\u201cThe argument is that we\u2019ve got this fantastic academy program which is producing some good players, and we\u2019re bringing them into our W-League team.

Internet telephony offers services and benefits unparalleled by traditional phone service. \n\nMany small businesses today are making the switch over to voip business phone systems. There are plenty of advantages to using such a hosted voip service provider , but a lot of small businesses are overlooking some of the most valuable features. Beyond options like voicemail, call waiting, toll-free numbers, call forwarding, and remote operation, companies will discover a host of other features that can help any small business. \n\n1: Voicemail to Email Transcription \nVoicemail to email transcription transcribes voicemail messages to text and sends them to a preferred email. Employees don't need to furiously scribbling names, numbers, and addresses. \n\n2: Call Screening \nCall screening is an often-forgotten feature of the VoIP business world that can come in handy. It allows businesses to look at a number on the caller ID and choose how to treat it. \n\n3: Coaching Tools \nInstead of giving employees advice after ending phone conversations with customers, the systems allow recommendations during the call. \n\n4: Auto Attendant \nAn auto attendant is one of the hidden gems of having hosted phone service.

In 2015, the White House statement said, \"On the tenth International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the American people pay tribute to the six million Jews and millions of others murdered by the Nazi regime.

On the contrary, the Holocaust was the culmination of millennia of hatred and discrimination targeting the Jews \u2013 what we now call anti-Semitism,\" Guterres said. \"...Anti-Semitism is alive and kicking.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 35 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Palm Beach","zipCode":"33410","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Palm Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WPBF","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"name":"WPBF","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wpbf.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201025887","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Labour has built houses before. We've done it before and we'll do it again,\" Mr Little said to rousing cheers from a room full of party faithful. \n   \nHe also committed to reversing health cuts, protecting the environment and creating a better future for the next generation for Kiwis through improved wages and an end to poverty. \n   \n\"We are ready to win, we are ready to go. We are ready to build that better New Zealand. Today we are ready to lead the next government of New Zealand,\" he said. \n   \nMr Little said anyone who had climbed the ladder of opportunity had to keep it there for those who follow. \n   \n\"That's the Kiwi way. That's what we do,\" he said. \n   \n\"That means giving a damn every time.\" \n   \nThose were sentiments shared by Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei who revealed she was inspired by \"mana wahine, fierce women, women who stand up for what they believe in\". \n   \nShe honoured activists Helen Kelly and Jeanette Fitzsimons who pursued meaningful change when the odds were against them. \n   \n\"The Green Party will do what's right, even when it's not easy,\" Ms Turei vowed. \n   \n\"We have the skills, knowledge and values to help shape Aotearoa; to make our great little country even better.\" \n    \nGuy Williams at joint Green and Labour state of the nation event \n \nSource: 1 NEWS \n   \nMs Turei said she would draw inspiration from women who were activists, solo and working mothers, women who protect their whanau from violence and \"the women who raised me and who I have raised\". \n   \nMr Little will also draw from his personal life, including his battle with prostate cancer. \n   \n\"It made me think about seizing opportunities, about making the best of this life,\" he said. \n   \n\"I've faced tough fights before and this is simply one tough fight we have to win,\" he later added. \n   \nBoth also took moments to criticise Mr English. \n   \nMs Turei described him as the \"architect of the housing crisis\", while Mr Little took aim at his decision not to attend Waitangi Day commemorations at Te Tii Marae next week. \n   \nHe claimed while New Zealand got a new prime minister last year the nation was still without a leader. \n   \nLabour and the Green Party signed a memorandum of understanding last year, committing to work together in the lead up to this year's election. \n   \nNo date has been set but it's expected to be in the latter half of the year, with September 23 thrown up as a possible date. \n   \nMr English is expected to announce the date as early as next week.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Labour and Greens create history with joint state of the nation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"ONE News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694975","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"34"},"name":"ONE News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tvnz.co.nz","publisher":"Television New Zealand"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201027944","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pierce","zipCode":"98405","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tacoma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tacoma News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661174","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3846"},"name":"Tacoma News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thenewstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201028210","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion.\n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed.\n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory.\n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d\n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport.\n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided.\n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d\n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.\n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d\n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million.\n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official.\n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.\n\nAs the measure\u2019s far-reaching impact became clear, and the airport chaos mounted throughout the day, Trump denied it was a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and said the process was going smoothly. \u201cWe were totally prepared,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban.\u201d\n\nThe move has hit the technology industry, which employs thousands of foreign-born workers, many from Muslim-majority countries. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday slammed Trump\u2019s executive order in a memo to employees, saying about 100 employees were affected, and advising those traveling abroad to reach out to the company\u2019s immigration teams for assistance.\n\nInvestors and start-up employees are worried as well. Tech workers from countries such as Egypt and Jordan fear the list could soon expand to include their countries.\n\nThe entertainment world felt repercussions, too. It\u2019s uncertain whether Iranian filmmaker and Oscar nominee Asghar Farhadi will be able to attend next month\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony, though there are artistic waivers to the ban.\n\nRelatives wondered when they would see loved ones again. Iranian American Milad Sharifpour, a physician at Emory University in Atlanta, was worried for his brother, Ali Reza, a green card holder who was in Tehran visiting family when the directive took effect. \u201cI am sad, I\u2019m upset, and I feel very frustrated,\u201d Sharifpour said.\n\nMany feared that what they intended as temporary trips abroad could become prolonged ordeals. A Syrian clarinetist who lives in New York and holds permanent U.S. residency was in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for a concert when the order took effect.\n\nIt left him unsure whether he would be able to go back to his Brooklyn apartment, he said, \u201clet alone all the concerts and residencies I have in the U.S. in the coming few months.\u201d\n\nHe asked not to be identified, because he will soon be trying to return to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI am not sure how to describe how I feel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is certainly not about me; it is about so many individuals whose lives were deeply affected.\u201d The United Nations human rights agency issued a statement calling the long-standing U.S. refugee resettlement program \u201cone of the most important in the world.\u201d It called on the Trump administration to ensure the U.S. \u201cwill continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\u201d the group said.\n\nAcross the United States, refugee advocates scrambled to ascertain the status of those who were already en route or about to leave when the order came down. A total of 30 refugees were scheduled to arrive in Atlanta next week from Somalia, Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAll had gone through months of security checks.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said J.D. McCrary, executive director of the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Atlanta office. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with anything like this ever happening on such a mass scale in the entire history of this program. Slamming the door on those fleeing persecution is deeply un-American.\u201d\n\nIn Congress, reaction to the immigration chaos tended to break down along party lines, with vociferous criticism from Democrats while Republicans largely remained silent.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Trump had chosen a \u201cdark path,\u201d while both Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco said the Statue of Liberty would have wept.\n\nOne of the few Republicans to speak out against the directive was Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said the order could play into the hands of jihadist groups by being excessively sweeping in nature.\n\n\u201cWhile not technically a Muslim ban, this order is too broad,\u201d Sasse said in a statement.\n\nAirports overseas and in the U.S. found themselves at ground zero for the spreading chaos. Five members of one Iraqi family, along with a Yemeni, were prevented from boarding flights in Cairo.\n\nAt the Frankfurt airport in Germany, a major hub for travel from the Middle East and onward to Europe and the U.S., more were stranded. A German radio network quoted federal police as saying that 20 people from all seven countries on the list were stuck in the airport\u2019s transit zone, unable to board flights for the U.S.\n\nIn Atlanta, a growing cluster of family members and lawyers gathered Saturday at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after at least five permanent U.S. residents who had traveled to Iran on vacation were detained by federal immigration officials.\n\nMansour Kenareh, 55, an Iranian software engineer who lives in Suwanee, Ga., said his brother-in law, his wife and their 10-year-old child had been detained after returning from a vacation in Tehran to visit family.\n\n\"They have green cards, they have bank accounts, they have a house here,\" Kenareh said as he paced the arrivals hall of the international terminal after an unfruitful visit to a Customs and Border Protection office. Officials, he said, had detained the family for more than five hours, even though they had lived legally in the U.S. for more than a year. \n\nSarah Owings, an immigration attorney, said that she had not been allowed to meet with the detained immigrants at the Atlanta airport. \n\n\u201cThese are people who live here; they have houses, they have dogs, cars,\u201d Owings said. \"This should not be happening. They can't send back a permanent resident without a hearing.\"\n\nLate Saturday, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said that all 11 people who were detained at the airport had been cleared and released.\n\nIn Europe, there was blowback from U.S. allies, who have absorbed a wave of refugees over the last two years and are already deeply unhappy with Trump for disparaging the NATO alliance and predicting the breakup of the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhen he rejects the arrival of refugees while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him,\u201d said French President Francois Hollande.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, well aware of Trump\u2019s evangelical Christian base of support, said pointedly, \u201c\u2018Love thy neighbor\u2019 is part of this tradition, the act of helping others.\u201d\n\nOn social media, users bemoaned what they said was a blow to what remained of the world\u2019s respect for American ideals.\n\n\u201cFascism USA 2017,\u201d tweeted Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian American author and activist.\n\nThe prospect of reciprocal measures was raised almost immediately \u2014 a factor that could potentially affect Americans including aid workers, tourists and business travelers. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry, condemning Trump\u2019s order, said Saturday that Iran \u201creserves the right of reciprocity,\u201d official outlets reported.\n\nTrump\u2019s move could also dampen hopes for negotiating the release of U.S. citizens held in any of the affected countries. Several Americans of Iranian descent are imprisoned in Iran on spy charges.\n\nHave the women\u2019s marches started a movement?

I\u2019m not the most gifted player in the world but I put my body on the line and my opinion across. Thankfully the managers have seen my strengths and utilised them. \n \n\u201cMy body is feeling good. At my age that might mean having an ice bath after training and icing my knee, after the injury there was more rehab to keep myself in tip-top shape. It is paying dividends at the moment. \n \n\u201cOn Thursdays I do pilates with our physio. I try to get stronger core muscles and more flexibility.\u201d \n \nCraig started the campaign in central defence but since the return to fitness of Shaun Hutchinson and recent signing of Jake Cooper from Reading he has shifted to left-back. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to moan if I\u2019m starting games,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be happy if I wasn\u2019t. \n \n\u201cJake came in on Friday morning and the pitch wasn\u2019t the greatest, we could only do 20 minutes outside. He introduced himself, did his song that night \u2013 which got him involved in the group. His was horrendous! But it\u2019s part of integrating into the squad. \n \n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know half of us but gave a really good account of himself at Bradford. About the only unfortunate thing was his header hitting the crossbar. He had a very steady debut.\u201d \n \nJed Wallace is a more familiar addition to the Millwall squad for the remainder of the season. The on-loan Wolves winger impressed on his first stint with the South Londoners last season. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s a very confident lad \u2013 most wingers are,\u201d said Craig. \u201cHis last time here was very successful. He came in and did exceptionally well \u2013 he chipped in with a few goals and his work-rate was second to none. Jed knows when to track back and go forward.\u201d \n \nCraig played a handful of games for the Lions in the 2003-04 campaign where they reached the FA Cup final. \n \nBut he was in the stands for the 3-0 defeat to Manchester United. \n \nNow comes a chance for the current Millwall side to move another step in the tournament \u2013 and knock out Premier League Watford. \n \n\u201cThey are a big scalp for us and we\u2019ll certainly be up for it,\u201d said Craig. \u201cThe league is our priority but sometimes it is nice to take your mind of that. This is more or less like a free game for ourselves. \n \n\u201cWe can go out and express ourselves. As soon as it is over we\u2019ll switch straight back to preparing for Walsall on Wednesday.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Tony Craig on 15th season as a pro - Millwall captain reveals reasons for his longevity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Greater London","zipCode":"SE20","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Bromley","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"LondonNewsOnline.co.uk","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606039184","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"LondonNewsOnline.co.uk","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201039308","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:56:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/t-craig-09874.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

A fantastic tournament for the likes of Scotland and Canada but a poor finish for the All Blacks Sevens after showing such promise yesterday. The series now heads to Sydney next weekend with South Africa well and truly sitting top of the table after a commanding weekend. \n\n   The new kid on the All Blacks Sevens' block is already proving he's one to watch. \nSource: SKY   \n8:50pm: South Africa 26 v Fiji 5 - Cup FINAL \n   \nIt's a glorious gold for South Africa as Seabelo Senatla achieves his own personal milestone in become the top try scorer of all time for the Blitzboks with 180. They're Champions in Wellington for the first time since 2002, and they stretch their lead at the top of the HSBC 2016-17 Sevens Series standings. \n   \n8:40pm: Halftime: South Africa 7 v Fiji 5 - Cup FINAL \n   \nTwo points and a Fiji yellow card is all that separates the two teams. Both giving it their all so far! \n   \n8:18pm: Scotland 28 v Canada 22 - 3rd Place \n   \nScotland the Brave!  Canada held the lead with 30s to go but James Fleming seals the day with his third try of the game and carries Scotland to bronze. They are already celebrating on the pitch and can you really blame them? The hat-trick hero says it was a full squad effort that produced this weekend's result. \"It was an enjoyable game, it was a whole squad effort. We have been building for the last two years, new coach, consistent squad, and Twickenham gave us belief. We\u2019re looking forward to the next one. We are hitting quarters and semis consistently now and it is awesome to have the squad we do.\" \n   \n7:48pm: NZL 12-17 ARG \n   \nTRY! Pumas win it at the death as NZL choke up the ball with pass to who knows inside their own half. The ball goes to ground and Argentina grubber it on and they're in as the hooter goes.

All Blacks Sevens with a costly turnover i ntheir own 22 after they are penalised for not releasing the pill. Argentina jump on it and score far right corner. Game on with a minute to go! \n   \n7:42pm: NZL 12-7 ARG \n   \nTRY! Curry's in after the ABs Sevens get a penalty inside Argentina's 22 for offside. The setpiece is a double cut and Curry comes onto the second change of direction at pace and there's no stopping him 5m out. NZ back in front! \n   \n7:39pm: NZL 5-7 ARG \n   \nKoroi shows another piece of magic to get into open field before delivering a no-look flick pass to Curry. Curry is brought down on Argentina's forty and he knocks it on! Halftime. \n   \n7:37pm: NZL 5-7 ARG \n   \nTRY! Argentina keep attacking up the middle of the field and it pays off as the black wall crumbles. good forty metres gained from relentlessly running off the rucks and it results in a try under the posts. \n   \n7:32pm: NZL 5-0 ARG \n   \nTRY!

Kenya was up 19-12 with seconds to go before a costly turnover gives Australia the ball in Kenya's half. Australia apply pressure and get a penalty close to the line. They take it quickly and dot down right in the left corner for a tough conversion. The drop kick goes up and it's beautiful, it's got the length but it curls away from the right post and it's just wide! Kenya claim the trophy in another stunning final! More of this to come please! \n   \n6:46pm: Russia 12 v Samoa 19 - 13th Place FINAL \n   \nTietjens' men finish on a high note in another physical match. Samoa had nearly double the tackles than their European opponents but they didn't budge in the final moments. Samoan captain Tila Mealoi wrapped up their weekend saying they are still developing under the Kiwi coach. \"I'm proud of my team, it's quite young and there are a few new guys in the team. We are really happy and really proud. We have given a springboard to the new guys, and we are now working on some structure with Sir Gordon. There is a big improvement in our fitness, which is the first thing we are looking at.\" \n   \n6:03pm: Canada 5 v South Africa 21 - Cup SF \n   \nThe Blitzboks were just too fast. Ans when Canada realised that and went physical, the South Africans beat them at the breakdowns too. Clinical performance from South Africa as it has been all tournament. We are in for two thrilling matches to close the tournament. The final will be at 8:30pm. \n   \n5:43pm: Scotland 12 v Fiji 19 - Cup SF \n   \nHeartbreaking for the Scots. They held a five point lead with two minutes to go but the Flying Fijians find the line twice. You can't help but feel for the Scots. They were playing brilliant rugby but their opponents find a second gear and took the lead with 30s to go before a penalty on the hooter saw them tap and gap for another try to secure it with a statement. Brilliant match regardless. Up next is Canada and South Africa. Can the Canadians do the unthinkable? \n   \n5:13pm: Argentina 19 v France 14 - 5th Place SF \n   \nSo it'll be Argentina that takes on the All Blacks Sevens in the 5th place final. The Los Pumas Sevens made twice as many tackles as France but never let that defence fall in crucial times.  \n   \n4:50pm: NZL 24-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! Stowers goes in in the far right corner on the fulltime hooter and that's a performance much more like yesterday's dominance. All Blacks Sevens looked the better team the entire match and discipline let England down big time. Easily man of the match has to go tou youngster Koroi. His first ever Sevens Series and he is proving to be quite the playmaker. NZL now wait on the winner of Argentina v France to find their opponent for the 5th place final. \n   \n4:42pm: NZL 17-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! That might just be the nail in the coffin! Beautiful skip pass again from Koroi and it's Iopu-Aso is over the chalk in the left corner.  \n   \n4:38pm: NZL 12-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! Set piece inside the 22 off a penalty tap and Ware is the benefactor this time from another great pass by Koroi. The youngster is playing superb! That takes us to halftime. \n   \n4:33pm: NZL 7-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! The captain's in under the posts! Brilliant hands on a play that started in their own 22! Koroi breaks away and gets a flashy pass off to his skipper to score. Great start! \n   \n4:30pm: NZL 0-0 ENG - 5th Place SF \n   \nWe're back underway in the Cake Tin with the All Blacks Sevens hoping to make fans happy again after a tough loss to Fiji this morning ended their hopes of defending their Wellington title. ENG to kick off. \n   \n3:42pm: Australia 24 v Wales 10 - Trophy SF \n   \nMcDermott and Taylor have led a fiery performance by the Australians to book a Trophy final with Kenya after seeing off Wales.

That ends USA's tournament while Kenya now wait to face either Australia or Wales. \n   \n2:55pm: Tietjens' Samoa get the job done convincingly with a 35-7 win over Papua New Guinea . Too many line breaks to keep track of and it's an easy win. They'll face Russia for 13th place. \n   \n2:36pm:  Russia come out ahead of Japan in a physical 15-5 clash. Russia smothered Japan's chances by keeping ball in hand for most part of the 13th place semi final. They will now play the winner of this next match between Papua New Guinea and Samoa. \n   \n2.05pm - South Africa 45 v France 0 - Cup QF \n   \nThe Blitzbokke have thrashed the French 45-0, looking to be the hot favourites in the tournament now with NZ going down to the Fijians earlier in the afternoon.   \n   \n1.47pm - Canada 17 v Argentina 12 - Cup QF \n   \nThe dream run for the Canadians continues after they held out a last attempt by the Argentinians.  \n   \n1.22pm - New Zealand 10 v Fiji 26 \n   Joeli Lutumailagi scored two long range tries in his side's 26-10 Cup quarter-final win over NZ. \nSource: SKY   \nNew Zealand score a consolation try through Tim Mikkelson with the Fijians marching their way to the Cup semis with a dominant win over NZ. \n   \n1.18pm - New Zealand 5 v Fiji 26 - Cup QF \n   \nTRY!

There are a variety of tools, software, and \u2018systems\u2019 available geared towards helping people (and companies) become far more efficient with time management. Unfortunately, not every employee or client has great time management skills and it doesn\u2019t appear to be something heavily focused on at any level of education. So, what that means is there is greater pressure on you as the Managed Service Provider (MSP) to keep your act together. \n \nTime wasted by MSPs means you\u2019re missing out on potential revenue from new and existing sources. What can you do? Well, a number of things actually. Let\u2019s take a look at the ways in which you, as the MSP, can become better at time management and make more money. \n Better Project Management  \nShort of telling you to simply stop wasting your time, one such way of wasting less time is becoming a better project manager. It is absolutely critical projects go off without a hitch and clients understand the timeline put in place is what will be followed. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to look into project management resources , such as what SPC International offers, but you still have to actually follow the steps. Better project management allows you to stick to firm deadlines, impress clients with how on top of things you are, and be able to move seamlessly from one project to the next because everything has been properly planned out. \n  \nHow Do We Waste Time at Work?: \n 48% surfing the web  33% socializing with co-workers  30% conducting personal business  19% making personal calls  15% taking long lunch breaks  *Source: Time Doctor   Create and Follow an Effective Managed Services Marketing Plan  \nWe\u2019re sure you\u2019ve heard this from others, as we have many times ourselves, but for some reason some MSPs seem to believe marketing is easy. Hate to break it to you, but it\u2019s not. For starters, you are going to waste a lot of time cold calling and sending out emails without much success because you likely haven\u2019t properly identified your target audience \u2013 the people who are most likely to be interested in your services as an MSP. Then of course there\u2019s figuring out what type of marketing you should be doing (direct response should probably be at the top of your marketing to-do list). Needless to say, it isn\u2019t as easy as it may seem. \n \nCreating a successful Managed Services marketing plan is the first step in producing consistent, dependable leads that can lead to consistent business growth. No more cold-calling, no more wasted efforts on activities that cost you more in time and money than what it gives back. \n Take a Break\u2026Seriously  \nIt may seem counter-productive, but taking a break every once in a while is actually a good thing. As an MSP, it can be easy to get caught up in the mountains of things you believe you have to do or accomplish in any given 24-hour period. Instead of getting caught up in a vicious cycle of exhausting all mental and physical energies each and every day, force yourself to only work on one thing at a time, and to actually stand up and walk away for 5-10 minutes every once in a while so you don\u2019t burn out. \n \nCountless studies on productivity have concluded that we are far less efficient workers when we\u2019re taking on too many things at once. Instead of focusing on doing one thing really well at a time, we end up doing a mediocre job on three or four different projects because we\u2019re jumping from one to the other before really completing anything. \n \nSo there you have it. If you want to become a more productive MSP and make more money as a result of wasting less valuable time, this is a good place to start. \n \nWant to learn more marketing and sales techniques to sell on value and increase your profitability during difficult economic times?

Too many Northerners, abolitionists, and others, who were supposed to be sympathetic to the plight of enslaved black folks, mitigated their white guilt by selectively hearing happiness in the harrowing sounds of what W.E.B. DuBois called the \"sorrow songs.\" Douglass exposed the lie in his brilliant way, arguing - to paraphrase - that slaves sing most when they are most sad. \n\nAlmost ironically now, some of the brightest, most visceral moments of black joy are embedded in the black church - not in the pulpit, but in the voices of so many black choirs. The black joy of a spiritually uplifting \"sorrow song\" moves us to tears, sends chills through our bodies, and for some, entices them to move, dance, and shout with abandon. This is black joy: a physical-spiritual connection made through our own artistic cultural production formed historically in the belly of our own program of resistance. We are still here. And we sing and we shout to remind you as much as to celebrate the unlikely fact of our very existence. \n\nIn some religious contexts, joy is that blessed form of happiness and solace that can only be derived from a reservoir of spirituality and an abiding faith in an almighty and all-knowing God. Black joy acknowledges this awesome belief in things unseen, but it is also predicated on the facts of our enduring fortitude in the face of transatlantic slavery and the long history of brutal white supremacy, and the cruel crimes of antiblack racial violence. Our collective black head is \"bloodied, but unbowed.\" \n\nMaybe punching a Nazi is not necessarily a joyous occasion. But when black Twitter remixed the video syncing/replaying the punch to the beat of Biggie Smalls' \"Hypnotize,\" the result was, well, the result was hypnotic - and some modicum of black joy was had by all who played and posted it. \n\nThe sounds of black joy will always be what's most remarkable about this counterintuitive concept - the laughter of a child, the sobs of joy for the first black president; the clanking and banging rhythms of a black chef preparing a meal in a cluttered kitchen. Black joy must be as mundane as it is aspirational in order for it to be at all. \n\nUltimately the counterintuitive, oxymoronic nature of black joy might very well be the key to understanding its most potent meaning. Joy in the face of the long history of pain is, for some, what is most remarkable about the black experience on these stolen lands. We don't attain or achieve black joy. We eke it out of this American project. We squeeze every bit of joy out of what at times and throughout history has been the silencing force of our spiritual voices. We sing (sometimes) because we are happy. \n\nJames Braxton Peterson is the director of Africana studies and associate professor of English at Lehigh University; author of several books, including \"The Hip-Hop Underground and African American Culture: Beneath the Surface\"; and host of WHYY's \"The Remix,\" which explores the intersection of race, politics, and popular culture. jbp211@lehigh.edu","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"A joyful chorus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201051494","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"caption":"Fatin Dantzler of the husband-and-wife duo Kindred the Family Soul will be the subject of a Black Joy article next month.","url":"http://media.philly.com/images/20170129_inq_cu1peterson29-b.JPG"},{"caption":"Poet Kavindu Jointe found freedom in the words of Nina Simone on a Taiwan mountain, in Wednesday's Inquirer.","url":"http://media.philly.com/images/20170129_inq_cu1peterson29z-c.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

Due Amici (\"Two Friends\" in Italiano) really is made by two Italian friends, including Gino Razzi from Penns Woods, along with Panorama staff members who helped pick, crush, and blend it in honor of the restaurant's 25th anniversary.

Barone \n\nis a writer in Doylestown \n\nLet's take a walk. \n\nWe all know what that means. I am inviting you to go out with me, on foot, and the arriving is entirely secondary to the walking. It makes every bit as much sense to take a walk to the store as it does to take a walk around the block, right back to where we started. \n\nPope Francis is a big fan of walking. He said, \"When you are walking, anything can happen.\" It's catching on, too. One of the most famous walks in the world, the Camino de Santiago in northwestern Spain, attracts more pilgrims than ever, and the 500-mile trek has existed for more than a thousand years. I was there a few years ago - my wife's family is from Galicia - and marveled at the mishmash of humanity ambling to the end point, the Cathedral of St. James. \n\nWalking is an attention-getter. If your boss says, \"Come to my office,\" you sense something formal or instructive is about to be related. If, instead, the boss comes up to you and says, \"Walk with me,\" you might detect an imminent moment of intimacy, revelation, even vulnerability. \n\nA walk is an empty thing. We fill it as we go. That squirrel crossing our path, grabbing an acorn and scurrying up a nearby tree could not have been planned. You simply encounter it, feel it, perhaps try to figure out a meaning for it. \n\nEven walks with purpose have this quality of emptiness, a waiting container that will be filled by whatever stands in the path. A friend who attended a political march and rally was rocked, not by the affirmation of her reason for being there but by the overwhelming encounters with so many different people and passions. \n\nA walk is also about the future. You may glance side to side, at your companion maybe, and you might even look back for a second, but your eyes are forced forward. Your orientation is toward where you are going, not where you are. In the Boy Scouts I sometimes took night hikes in which my only illumination was a measly flashlight trained on the ground directly in front of me. \"It's all you need,\" Mr. McCusker would say, correctly. \n\nWalking is a deceleration of life. I slow down to a walk; I don't speed up to a walk. That means I am choosing to invest precious time and effort to the trip. It can be momentous. If I am walking the 10 miles to work instead of driving, I am doing something astonishing. If I commit to the 470-mile \"Camino\" across Spain or a portion of the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail, I am likely making a life-altering investment. \n\nWalking is a shedding. Ask any college student about the care it takes to strut around campus all day, making sure that backpack is not too cumbersome. When you walk, you ask, seriously and not frivolously, Do I really need to take this with me? \n\nIt's no wonder that many religions make walking sacred. The Hajj. The Kumano Kodo. The Camino de Santiago, the Stations of the Cross. One of the most revered speeches of our history, Dr. King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, took place after a walk. When we humans want to memorialize a cause or an event, as often as not we do it by walking - from the Thanksgiving Day parade to the Walk to Defeat ALS. \n\nUltimately, walking is a gift. To fully realize this, imagine a doctor saying you'll never walk again, or helping a loved one rehab a knee replacement, or witnessing a child's first step. \n\nSo, let's take a walk, you and me. You'll meet your future, squirrels and all. You'll be fascinated, bored, excited, confused, exhausted, exhilarated, and, finally, at rest. \n\nAnything can happen. Like life, for instance. \n\norby114@aol.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Commentary: Let's take a walk together","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201053143","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But the people at FINsix Electronics have liberated the masses from the massive (chargers) with the diminutive new Dart Laptop Charger. Compatible with most PC laptops and notebooks, thanks to the nine included interchangeable power port tips that connect to the detachable six-foot cable, the charger is a mere 2.75 inches long by 1.5-inches wide and 1-inch thick. Using something called high-frequency switching technology, the developers managed to shrink the innards of the typical mid-cable brick while retaining the standard 65-watt output power. While they were at it, they added an in-line 5-volt, 2.1-amp USB port, so you can charge your cellphone or other device while powering up your laptop. The charger also has a two-prong plug, (no more need for a three-prong outlet). And the Dart's versatile 100-240VAC input means you won't need a voltage converter anywhere in the world (just the right-shape plug adapter). The Dart doesn't work with those cutting-edge USB type-C laptops (such as the new MacBooks, Chromebooks, and similar tech-forward models). But FINsix is about to roll out the Dart-C so you, too, can take a load off. (Whatever laptop you're toting, be sure to check the company website compatibility guide to make sure your model isn't among the unfortunate 5 percent that just can't get along with a Dart.) \n\nFINsix Dart Laptop Charger in blue, magenta, gunmetal, orange, or silver is $99.99; Dart-C, available soon, will also cost $99.99; optional USB type-C cable for standard Dart charger will be $34.99; at www.finsix.com .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"PC industry news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Slimmed-down laptops get a charger to match","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["TravelTourism","Recreation","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.finsix.com/"],"sequenceId":"695201053319","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Bob was concerned, though, that chiseling off chunks of plaster was damaging his hands. \n\nThe new homeowner wasn't wimping out: His hands are his livelihood. Now 59, he has played piano at area bars, restaurants, and hotels since his teens. \n\nTo the rescue, armed with a power chisel, came younger brother Dennis Egan, who removed the plaster and repointed the fieldstone. \n\nDennis is not musical, Bob says, but has other talents. \"[He] does carpentry, woodwork, stone masonry, everything.\" \n\nHe also removed plaster from the first-floor fireplace and repointed that stone. He installed a first-floor bathroom and a new kitchen with maple cabinetry, Corian countertops, a Moravian tile backsplash, and a greenhouse window. \n\nSometime in the late 1940s or early '50s, a dining room with a glass-door corner cabinet was added to the house. Dennis built a duplicate cabinet for an adjacent wall. \n\nUpstairs, the brothers removed a drop ceiling and uncovered rotting beams. \n\n\"There were squirrels nesting, and termites,\" Bob recalls. \"We replaced seven beams.\" \n\nDennis added closets in the second-floor and attic bedrooms, using period board-and-batten construction and wrought-iron hinges and clasps. He built a second-floor bathroom in a tight space to preserve an original fireplace. \n\nBob chose to veer from 18th-century décor, painting woodwork white rather than a Williamsburg pastel. The kitchen is avocado. Other rooms are a neutral fawn, to set off colorful paintings by area artists. \n\nThe unadorned lines of the Mission-style dining room set and living room chairs complement the Colonial architecture. A red pull-out couch accommodates extra guests. Two leaded-glass lamps and a collection of handcrafted amber and blue cocktail glasses in the china cabinets add sparkle. \n\nDennis built a deck at the back of the house, accessed by sliding-glass doors from the dining room. The deck now overlooks a swimming pool, a pool house and a vintage two-seater outhouse. \n\nPrevious owners had replaced the original winding staircase from the living room to the second floor with straight-run stairs. A friend, Paul Rowan, crafted a new winding staircase, making a template of cardboard and rope first to make sure everything fit. \n\nWith the removal of the old stairs, Bob had space for his 1897 Bechstein studio grand piano. A smaller piano is in the garage, which he converted to an office and rehearsal studio for his business, Bob Egan Entertainment. Bob also books performers, including, singers, string quartets, jazz trios, and DJs for weddings and social events. \n\nThere is never a concern that music might disturb the neighbors. The house is on more than two acres, and adjoining properties have even more wooded acreage. \n\nBob grew up in Warminster with five younger siblings. At age 10, he had his first piano lessons at St. Joseph's School. At the nuns' urging, his parents bought a piano - \"an old upright, tuned and delivered for $119,\" Bob recalls. \n\nAfter graduating from Archbishop Wood High School in Warminster, Bob studied music at Bucks County Community College and at what is now the University of the Arts. By then, he was playing piano on weekends at the Swan Hotel in Lambertville. \n\nIn his living room hangs a print of the Chelsea Bar in New York. \"I bought it because it looks just like the Swan Hotel when I started there in 1977,\" Bob says. \n\nA painting by local artist Robert Beck shows patrons gathered around Bob at a piano, accompanying a young singer. The setting is Odette's, a celebrated restaurant on the Delaware in New Hope. \n\nFor almost 20 years, until a series of floods forced Odette's closing a decade ago, Bob produced the restaurant's cabaret. Though he sometimes sings while he plays, \"I don't call myself a singer,\" he says. \"I prefer working with singers.\" \n\nA few weeks back, Bob hosted a party in his charming farmhouse. On a Sunday, his day off, he was at the piano, playing for his guests, accompanying singers, and having a wonderful time.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sally A.

Once in a great long while, we will have a huge blow-up. It doesn't get physical, but my husband will start dropping the F-bomb. Last night, such a dispute occurred - he swore and stomped around, and the kids could hear. We have household rules about cussing - but he lost his temper. \n\nHe is under stress at work, and I think this contributes a great deal to his loss of control. \n\nToday, I get the silent treatment. It will pass by tomorrow - at least it usually does. What to tell the kids? \n\nAnswer: You tell the kids what you always tell the kids when one of you screws up. You say you're sorry - in this case, he says it - and admit the mistake by name. \"I lost my cool, no excuses. You deserve a better effort from me.\" \n\nIf he refuses, you need to tell the kids you're sorry you argued, you'll work with Daddy on it, and it's going to be OK. \n\nKids - people, I should say - are naturally inclined to lie their way out when they're busted, so push against that by making it clear that mistakes aren't big horrible things that must never be said out loud. Normalize the admission of fault, normalize a show of love for family members at their least lovable times. \n\nThis is the whole purpose of \"household rules\" and the adults who serve as their enforcers, beyond just keeping a household in line. Kids need to see their trusted adults make the effort to follow those rules themselves and demonstrate humility and grace when their efforts fall short. \n\nConscientiously raised children are ones who have been told and shown how to conduct themselves when it's their turn to mess up. Doing the wrong thing isn't an \"if,\" it's a \"when,\" for everybody - and the consequences of a mistake tend to get worse when we try to deny, shift blame, or cover up. \n\nSo you have a duty here to set a crucial example of taking responsibility up front. \n\nBecause the problem you're writing about is a recurring one, you also have to take responsibility beyond just a \"Sorry, my bad,\" from Dad. He really must do better, and that means conceding that he needs a healthier way to manage his stress. Day-to-day mitigation, that is, instead of ignore-ignore-ignore, BOOM, silence - no stage of which is healthy. \n\nThis is his step to take, of course, and you can't take it for him - but you can be the one who calmly and lovingly insists you both take a hard look at your coping methods. Wait till the emotions of the most recent eruption have cooled, then step in, with love: \"Ignoring things till we have an explosive fight isn't good for the kids to see. I'd like us both to learn how to manage our day-to-day stresses better. Will you commit to this with me?\" \n\nQuestion: Husband and I are buying a house. The area that both of us want to live in is 15 to 25 minutes from my parents, and three hours from his. They used to live in the area but moved away. \n\nThe problem is, his parents expect us to get a house with a full second bathroom (rather than a half), and at least four bedrooms, because we want kids, and his parents want their own dedicated room. \n\nFor the amount we want to pay, that just is not possible. \n\nHusband and I are both fine completely ignoring it for now, but how do we handle it once we're at closing and they throw a fit?

Unless we find a way to restore, revive, and rebuild the American family, no initiatives developed by the Trump administration can hope to achieve the renewed greatness he has promised. \n\nTrump's egotism was revealed when, in his inaugural address, he failed to call on the American people to take on the responsibility to \"Make America Great Again.\" A civilization's greatness percolates up through society.

They penned thousands of thoughtful letters to family, friends, political allies, and foreign leaders. They dashed off countless essays to newspapers in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Four of them were engaged in composing 18th-century America's two longest, most learned political works: the Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison, and John Adams' Defence of the Constitutions of the United States (both appearing in 1787-88). \n\nOf all the Founders, Adams wrote the most and was the most concerned for the future of America's new republican governments. The difficulties that he foresaw bear directly on the current state of American politics. \n\nAdams expressed his first disagreement with his Revolutionary colleagues even before the Declaration of Independence. He supported the same republican architecture - a two-house legislature, an executive branch, and an independent judiciary - shared by most American leaders, but with an important distinction. He was firmly opposed to the executive councils that several states substituted for the imperial governors whom they had just expelled from office. \n\nSo committed was Adams to the necessity of a single strong executive that in 1775 he labeled Britain's constitutional monarchy a republic, in which the king was simply \"the first magistrate.\" He finally got his chance to show America's new state governments how executive power ought to be expressed by creating a powerful governor, annually elected by all voters and with a veto over all legislation, in his finest creation, the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780. This document, the most similar of the early state constitutions to the U.S. Constitution that followed it, is now the oldest functioning written constitution in the world. \n\nAdams' second major difference with his countrymen developed more slowly but came to dominate his political writings from the 1780s until his death. \n\nBefore the Revolution, Adams had given little thought to the political role of America's provincial aristocracies, but the War for American Independence created unprecedented opportunities for a few men to make fortunes by supplying the war effort. Adams soon became alarmed at the ambition and avarice of many of these wealthy men. This led him to three broad conclusions: Aristocracies of birth, wealth, and talent existed in every society; the ambition of many aristocrats threatened the political stability of every republic; and the talents of aristocrats could be safely employed by republics that developed ways to control their natural avarice and ambition. \n\nLooking to the future, Adams vacillated between predicting disaster for an American republic that refused to recognize and control its aristocracy and hoping that America could develop this essential control. Most of his Revolutionary colleagues, including Jefferson, Madison, and even Washington, denied that the new American republic, whose federal constitution forbade the creation of titles of nobility, still had an aristocracy, or that they, no matter how many slaves or acres of land they owned, were aristocrats. Adams knew better, but his constitutional solutions - making America's president stronger to counter aristocratic power, and making the Senate, which he saw as the natural center of aristocratic power, weaker - would probably have been unequal to the challenge. \n\nMoving to the present day, one can readily imagine that of all the Founders, Adams would be the least surprised - and Jefferson the most - to see the citizens of our republic become so vastly unequal in wealth, as men of great fortunes have come to dominate the executive branch, the Senate, and even the House of Representatives. This has happened before in America, in the late 1800s and again in the 1920s, and each time political action effectively resisted this development. But since the 1970s America's aristocracy of wealth has become as powerful as ever. \n\nAdams probably would be surprised to see how thoroughly the executive branch, which he hoped would be America's principal guardian against aristocracy, has become increasingly enmeshed in that same power. But he would still teach us that there are only two broad defenses against this perennial threat: as effective and universal a system of public education as we can possibly devise; and eternal vigilance against the powers of an aristocracy - whether we call it an oligarchy, a plutocracy, or a power elite - that most Americans still refuse to acknowledge.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Commentary: Education and vigilance can guard against oligarchy","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201054965","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When their massive demonstrations failed to budge Beijing, they tried a very different tack. \n\nTo understand their achievements, a little history is needed. Hong Kong, with its fabulous harbor and elegant skyscrapers set against Victoria Peak, was handed back to China by its British colonial masters in 1997. China agreed to let the city retain its capitalist economy along with many democratic freedoms for 50 years - including legislative elections, an independent judiciary, and a free press. Under this \"one country, two systems\" dispensation, the chief executive of Hong Kong was ultimately supposed to be chosen by \"universal suffrage.\" \n\nBit by bit, China has encroached on those freedoms - squeezing educators, the judiciary, and the media - even kidnapping four booksellers who printed books critical of the Beijing government. \n\nBeijing's advance rejection of fully democratic elections for the chief executive in 2017 led tens of thousands of Hong Kong students and other pro-democracy activists to take to the streets in the 2014 Umbrella Revolution. For 79 days the activists peacefully occupied major thoroughfares, clearing their trash each day and using umbrellas to fend off tear gas and rain. \n\nUltimately, the activists lost. China stood firm, the protesters dispersed, and Beijing further curbed Hong Kong freedoms. \n\n\"After the Umbrella Revolution, people were discouraged. They felt helpless,\" recalled Nathan Law, a slim, bespectacled 23-year-old. Then head of the Hong Kong student union, he was a key protest organizer. \"Support for the democratic movement had grown, but people were tired of expressing that by protesting,\" he said. \n\nDistraught, divided among themselves, the organizers could have given up. There was much finger-pointing between more radical elements and traditional democracy activists. \n\nBut finally, says Law, the various factions took the long view - they would try to change the system from within. \n\n\"A core group of people became very active in electoral politics,\" Law told me. They organized new pro-democracy parties (including Demosisto, which Law chairs) in order to run for seats for Hong Kong's Legislative Council last September. \"This was David vs. Goliath without the slingshot,\" says Margaret Ng, a Hong Kong lawyer and longtime democracy activist. \n\nThe young people helped organize the largest voter turnout since 1997, which handed pro-democracy forces 55 percent of the popular vote. Beijing-imposed rules prevented them from gaining a majority of the 70 seats, but the 29 they won are sufficient to block government changes to parliamentary rules or Hong Kong's constitution. \n\nMoreover, unlike previous pro-democracy candidates who sought to work within China-imposed rules, six people under age 40 were elected on platforms that called for self-determination for Hong Kong. One of them was Law, the youngest of them all. \n\nThe story doesn't end there, however, and the struggle has only gotten tougher. \n\nUnder Beijing pressure, two of the six young lawmakers have been expelled from the council for failure to swear allegiance to Beijing using the mandatory oath. Four others, including Law, have been taken to court on charges that they, too, failed to deliver the oath properly - even though they had already been officially sworn in. \n\n\"I said every word of the oath,\" Law recalled in his legislative office, whose windows look out at ships in the harbor. \"But I also quoted words from Gandhi, saying, 'I will not obey a regime that murdered the people.' \" \n\nIf Law loses his case, he will have to pay onerous court costs and return all the salary he has received. His parents are blue-collar workers who don't have money to help him. \"I could be bankrupt before I graduate from university,\" he says. \"This is an example to others in the future.\" \n\nWhen I asked him how he sleeps at night, he responded with incredible calmness. \"I'm not blindly optimistic,\" he said. \"But it is important to recognize that we are fighting a long battle and everything we do gains a little for the future. I am not afraid of being defeated as long as we have the courage to continue the war.\" \n\nWas he worried that the election of Donald Trump would mean less U.S. support for democracy movements elsewhere? \"People here believe in liberalism and freedom,\" he said, \"and are a bit disappointed in the U.S. elections, but I still have to see how it goes. \n\n\"Democracy has a self-remedying capacity, checks and balances, and you can kick people out who rule badly. It is time for that factor to shine.\" \n\nLaw's message should be taken to heart by those who fear a Trump presidency. Hong Kong activists swapped protests for participation in electoral politics despite immense odds. They were successful but now must keep struggling. They deserve our support, and U.S. government attention. As Margaret Ng put it: \"Hong Kong is not a sideshow. It is the only city in China with rule of law.\" \n\nMore than that, with their determined entry into local politics, Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists offer a road map for how their American counterparts should proceed. \n\ntrubin@phillynews.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Trudy Rubin"},"topics":[{"name":"Beijing news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Worldview: Trudy Rubin: Hong Kong activists set example for U.S. counterparts","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201055142","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's the lens that should be used to look at any idea from Washington as President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. \n\nNot much is known about what a possible replacement would cover, but the early signs are not good. The number of people who would lose health care ranges from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's estimate of 18 million to the almost 30 million estimated by the Urban Institute, a liberal public policy think tank. \n\nThat looming catastrophe seems to have had no impact on Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) or Reps. Frank LoBiondo (R., N.J.), Patrick Meehan (R., Pa.), and Ryan Costello (R., Pa.). They thoughtlessly voted to begin dismantling Obamacare without having a replacement in hand. \n\nIt's hard to believe the lawmakers were thinking about everyday families when they voted. Maybe they were thinking more about their well-heeled constituents, the ones in households averaging $2.2 million in annual income, who stand to pay about $50,000 a year less in taxes if the ACA is killed. \n\nThe health-care industry also expects to benefit handsomely if the cost-cutting measures now required by the ACA are repealed. That's why it showered politicians with $264 million in campaign contributions and invested an additional $385 million on lobbying efforts last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Losing Obamacare would free employers to cut or stop subsidizing employee coverage. \n\nIt's not surprising that insurance companies that haven't picked up as much revenue as they expected from the larger customer base guaranteed by the ACA have joined those attacking the law. But must they misrepresent the truth? \n\nA federal judge blocked the proposed $37 billion merger between Aetna and Humana after determining that Aetna lied when it said it pulled out of 11 states because it was losing money under Obamacare. Fortunately, the Justice Department prevailed on behalf of consumers by arguing that the merger of two insurance behemoths would reduce competition and raise costs. \n\nHealth-care consumers will lose if the ACA dies without a comparable replacement. Analyses show 700,000 people could be denied health care in New Jersey; in Pennsylvania, it's 1.1 million. Rising costs could lock out even more people and residents of states that continue to provide expanded Medicaid coverage may pay higher taxes to cover that cost. \n\nThere's little proof that repealing the ACA would do more than shift costs from corporate and wealthy interests to middle-income and poor families. Any replacement is likely to harm people if it's not affordable and doesn't provide comprehensive care. \n\nToomey, LoBiondo, Meehan, and Costello are voting without asking the right questions. They don't have a clue as to how to make sure their constituents have access to quality health care, and they don't seem to care.

When the ice on the Delaware and the Schuylkill would freeze, and skaters would glide among refreshment booths and ox-roast spits. \n\nOr the ponds at Eighth and Arch or Ninth and South would offer an afternoon's glide. Or the rinks that cropped up during the 1860s (the West Philadelphia Park at 32nd and Walnut, the Eastwick Park at Gray's Ferry, say) would offer wintry, less risky entertainments. \n\nPhiladelphians \"are the best and most elegant skaters in the world,\" the Revolutionary Army Capt. Alexander Graydon is said to have claimed. I'm not sure how anyone would judge such a thing, but it is true that strapping blades to one's feet and heading off toward speed and lift is an elegant thing, or at least I found it to be, decades ago, when I was young. \n\nI'd gotten my start on a frozen Boston pond. I'd had my first lessons at a rink in Wilmington. But it was at the Philadelphia Skating Club & Humane Society in Ardmore where I began to call myself a skater - an aspirational denomination if ever there was one. \n\nAt the club, I devoted myself to the discipline of figure eights and the sound of scribes cutting the ice. I lived private sessions and private lessons, drank the snack bar hot chocolate while the Zamboni huffed, and competed in regional competitions with the sometimes reckless speed of my footwork, spins, and jumps. My father would drive me to the rink in the early dark, before school, and my mother would drive me in the afternoons, and on weekends I lived there, in my homemade dresses and my putty-colored tights, among friends and at least one rival. \n\nOlympic gold medalist Scott Hamilton would show up from time to time. Scott Hamilton! Dick Button had been there in the past. Susie Wynne was yet to come. And in a pair of glass display cases sat the iron skates of another century, denoting the history of this place that had, in 1861, merged the instructional ideals and rescue-mindedness of the Humane Society and the Skaters Club. Out on the Schuylkill, operating from the building now occupied by the Philadelphia Girls Rowing Club, the Humane Society would protect skaters from \"roughs,\" teach them the art of the twirl, and employ a short wooden reel, a cord of some 60 feet in length, and ladders to save those who had fallen through a broken patch of ice. \n\nBy the late 1930s, the Society had moved to the building where, out there in my sharpened blades, my mother sometimes watching from the lounge above, a high school friend sometimes standing on the edge, I could believe in my own beauty, soar to my own heights, lose myself inside the songs that played, over and again, and again. I wanted loveliness. I wanted to be someone, and sometimes, when I hit the angles right, when the ice was clear, when the music was loud, I was. Or allowed myself to think I was. \n\nA few days after watching the City Hall skaters, I returned to Ardmore, to the rink that, despite all the transmutations of my self, my definitions of beauty, my nicked and dented dreams, has not changed. That parabolic roof still arches high. Those glass-block windows still mute the sun. The bleachers are still sparse, and the ice still runs continuous to the unbarricaded edge, where the coaches still stand in their warm boots and coats, calling out for sharper diagonals on the footwork and more height on the double axel. \n\nFran Mycek, whose father ran this place before Fran did, is still there, too, 39 years into running, with his wife and with the help of his children, the membership and public sessions, the skate shop, the Zamboni, the refrigeration system. He remembers the skaters I ask him about. He still takes care of Scott Hamilton's blades. He regrets, as I regret, that competitive skating has become more about athletics than grace. \n\nI stand on the edge as the handful of skaters in their black pants and simple tops lean into their songs, lift off of the ice, count the rotations on their spins. I wear a heavy coat and heavy shoes, a camera on my shoulder, a second lens in a strappy bag, a purse, for I am a writer now, encumbered by paper and pen. I am weighted, in other words, and they are speed, they are youth, they are hope, they are near, they are far, they are almost impossible to photograph, but I stand there, clicking and then not clicking, until I stop and simply watch, and very much want. \n\nI look up, toward the lounge, in search of my mother. I look across, toward the door, for the boy who sometimes came. I take the whole smell and sound and light of it in, that crisp hard knock on my lungs, and time is elastic. Finally, leaving, I look for my father's car in the parking lot, wish for his question: \"How did it go?\" \n\nI call him instead, on my way home. \"Dad,\" I say. \"I was there.\" \n\nb.kephart@fusion-communications.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Delaware Valley news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Gliding into the past and dreams of youth","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://junctureworkshops.com/"],"sequenceId":"695201056326","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"caption":"The old rink, the Philadelphia Skating Club & Humane Society, has not changed.","url":"http://media.philly.com/images/20170129_inq_cu1kephart29Z-c.jpg"},{"caption":"General manager Fran Mycek and his family go way back with the rink.","url":"http://media.philly.com/images/20170129_inq_cu1kephart29-a.JPG"},{"caption":"The parabolic roof still arches high decades later at the Philadelphia Skating Club & Humane Society in Ardmore.","url":"http://media.philly.com/images/20170129_inq_cu1kephart29-e.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

In fact, American would have been well within its rights to wait two months before returning the money. \n\nLet's pause for a moment to consider the absurdity of this situation. An airline is allowed to keep your money for two months - can you say \"interest-free loan?\" - while the rest of us must pay our bills promptly. Oh, and how long does it take American to withdraw the money from your son's account? Seconds. \n\nSomething is just not right with this. American should have returned the money. In seconds. \n\nThis isn't an American problem or even an airline problem. Corporate America creates rules that favor it and allow it to benefit from holding on to your money for a few extra weeks. I've asked executives about the sluggish refund process, and they've told me, with straight faces, that the problem is exacerbated by credit card billing cycles and overly cautious accounting processes. I think that's nonsense. If they benefited from speedy refunds, they would have figured out a way to send you the money instantly. But they have no motive, so here we are. \n\nA brief, polite email to one of American's customer service executives might have shaken a check loose from the accounting department. I list names, numbers, and emails on my consumer advocacy site: elliott.org/company-contacts/american. \n\nI contacted American on your son's behalf and it informed me that your refund had been processed - hopefully in time for him to avoid paying a big credit card bill. \n\nChristopher Elliott's latest book is \"How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler\" (National Geographic).

It was harbored by the most brilliant political mind of the Founding generation: John Adams. Unlike Roosevelt, who was chiefly a political practitioner, Adams was a profound student and theorist of the power of wealth, a political philosopher who analyzed the danger of oligarchy with subtlety and rigor. \n\nThroughout his career of thinking and writing - a career that coincided with a life of political leadership - Adams sought to convince his fellow Americans that the power of wealth was among the chief threats facing the republican order. \n\nThe power of the rich is often understood in simple terms of financial transactions. It is well-known, for example, that the rich buy power by purchasing media space, funding lobbyists, and contributing to campaigns. John Adams believed that the power of wealth was far more complex and extensive. \n\nAdams thought that the rich tended to be acquainted with men of professional success and high educational attainment, and that these talented and successful contacts \"will be connected with them and attached to them.\" Will Conway, a presidential candidate in the TV drama House of Cards , defines power as \"the people you collect.\" John Adams would add that wealth makes it much easier to collect people. \n\nApart from their powerful networks of peers, the rich also possess top-down, hierarchical networks. Rich people often sit atop a social pyramid, with many less well-off individuals dependent on them for material needs. \n\n\"It will be easily conceived,\" Adams wrote, \"that all the rich men will have many of the poor, in the various trades, manufactures, and other occupations in life, dependent upon them for their daily bread.\" \n\nEvery rich man could claim to be a provider - or, in modern terms, a \"job creator\" - and this claim would add weight to his political opinions. \n\nMost uniquely, Adams thought that wealth generates power because wealth glitters. A strange and unique feature of Adams' writings is his frequent mention of feminine beauty alongside wealth as a source of oligarchic power. He noted that Socrates had called beauty \"a short-lived tyranny\" and that Diogenes called it \"the best letter of recommendation,\" and Adams argued that it was not only beautiful women who wielded power on account of their beauty but also, and perhaps especially, their male relations. \n\nAdams discussed beauty alongside wealth because he was at pains to point out that wealth, like beauty, owed its power in large part to its glaring distinction. Like beauty, wealth is \"acknowledged to glitter with the brightest luster in the eyes of the world.\" Adams feared that ordinary citizens would look with admiration upon the glaring wealth of the richest citizens, and that this admiration would be a potent source of oligarchic power. \n\nIn sum, the richest citizens - alongside those born into the best-known families - would wield a dangerous amount of power in America. They were, in Adams' words, \"the most difficult animals to manage of any thing in the whole theory and practice of government.\" \n\nConservatives and progressives alike have characterized the Founding Fathers as preoccupied with the danger of populism. Conservative admirers have depicted a pantheon of dignified patricians who loved liberty but feared the untrammeled mob. Meanwhile, progressives have depicted a class of privileged elites who struggled to suppress the rising tide of popular democracy. \n\nJohn Adams did fear populism, and he sought institutions that would contain the threat of demagoguery. But as much as he feared the specter of populism, he feared the specter of oligarchy more. \n\nThis fact makes his legacy all the more important in our time. If Donald Trump campaigned as a populist firebrand, he is governing as oligarch-in-chief, a billionaire who refuses to resolve conflicts of interest and who has appointed a cabinet of billionaires and multimillionaires whose net wealth is greater than the combined GDP of the world's poorest 39 countries. \n\n\"One of the great concerns that I have,\" Bernie Sanders exclaimed a few days after the November election, \"is that we are moving toward an oligarchic form of society.\" If that concern seems outside of the American mainstream, it is only because we have forgotten our history.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Commentary: Adams saw power of wealth as threat to the nation","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201058169","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

My sister Dana McAllister, Marcia, and I would spend time together on weekends going bowling and enjoying family dinners and fun times. \n\nAfter her studies at Plymouth Whitemarsh High School, Marcia returned to Rio to attend college and begin a career as a piano professor. This was pre-Facebook, so we rarely heard from her again, but for an occasional card at the holidays. \n\nFast-forward 32 years to 2012. I had such fond memories of befriending an exchange student I decided to become a host parent. From August 2012 to January 2013, I hosted a 16-year-old Brazilian girl, Isabella Corbi Silva, at my home. \n\nIn a strange twist of serendipity, I got a friend request on Facebook from Marcia just after Isabella left the United States. \"Come to Rio, you will like it here,\" she wrote. We emailed each other often, but traveling out of the country wasn't in the cards for me. \n\nAfter three years, I made a plane reservation for two weeks in August. The timing lined up with the 2016 Olympics in Rio, my birthday, and a three-week vacation break for Marcia. \n\nBefore the trip, I wanted to learn the language and rented a Portuguese CD to learn some basics: obrigado (thank you) and bom dia (good day) were my go-to phrases. \n\nMy plane left JFK Airport for the 10-hour flight from New York to Rio. With all the planning behind me, I finally had time to think about what was ahead. I hadn't seen Marcia in more than 30 years. \n\nWould we get along? Would I like Brazilian food? Would I understand the language ? \n\nMarcia greeted me at the airport with a big smile and hug. Right away, I felt at ease. Her small apartment faced the lagoon not far from Ipanema Beach. Each day was filled with new adventures: strolling the famous streets of Rio, shopping at the Olympic store, seeing the famous Christ statue and the amazing views at Sugarloaf. There was never a dull moment. \n\nI was exhausted at night. The views from all over Rio left me mesmerized. I was welcomed by her family and friends. A bike-riding adventure started with a breakdown and ended with a windstorm and the kindness of a stranger to repair the bike again. \n\nAs for my concerns about whether I would enjoy the food? I enjoyed it all, particularly a Brazilian treat, brigadeiro , a type of bonbon, in a variety of forms, including gelato, ice cream, and hot chocolate. \n\nDuring our adventures, we met people from all over the world: France, Poland, England and more. During our tour of the favela , or shantytown, we witnessed living conditions that were well beyond cramped. The residents struggle each day and, unfortunately, never leave their neighborhoods. We traveled by cab, bus, subway, car, and on foot. My birthday was memorable: I witnessed an Olympic rowing race; (Germany won), walked on the beach, and bought a sundress from a beach vendor. Then we had lunch next to the beach and listened to a band playing samba music. \n\nAlthough it was winter in Rio, the weather was just right, 65 to 75 degrees each day. \n\nMarcia loves to shop, and we managed to see every mall as well as a movie (in English with Portuguese subtitles) and a concert. I was constantly converting the prices in my head. We shared many laughs, fun times, and great memories. Yes, it was a long time coming but our friendship was renewed and I look forward to seeing her here in the U.S. in August. \n\nDid a travel experience move you, change you, or give you great memories?

When my CNN program ended on Capitol Hill at 7 p.m., I ran to make the Northeast Regional, Amtrak train No. 182, which left Union Station on time at 7:20 bound for Boston. On board with me were 600 women who had just marched against President Trump. \n\nThere were no empty seats on the festive train. Many women wore hand-knitted, pink pussy hats and homemade signs dotted the overhead luggage compartment. An animated welcome on the PA from a conductor was greeted with applause, a first in my many trips aboard Amtrak. \n\nRachel Barany was my seatmate for two hours. She was headed home to New York City, having spent the day marching with her daughter, a junior at Johns Hopkins. Meanwhile, her older daughter was doing likewise with her husband in New York City. Barany told me she teaches history to fifth and sixth graders at Friends Seminary, a Quaker school near Union Square. She was tired from an exhilarating day spent with five mothers and daughters, one father and a son, and a \"wonderful ragtag group of Hopkins friends.\" \n\n\"Our numbers continued to grow as more and more kids found each other at the march. . . . There were a good number of us on the mall, after the rally - that we couldn't hear, but no matter,\" she said. \n\n\"Two big gifts,\" she told me, were \"getting to know the kids in this setting and hearing so much from passersby about their concerns and hopes for the country.\" \n\nWhile I was en route to the café care on a beer run, it occurred to me that if there were 600 exuberant guys aboard, many having a drink after an emotion-filled day, it would have been a much different train. There would probably have been arguments and fights, even if they were united in purpose. After all, common desire for Eagles victories didn't eliminate the need for Judge Seamus McCaffery to preside for years at the Eagles Court in the basement at Veterans Stadium. And there is this statistic: According to the federal Bureau of Prisons, as of Dec. 24, the U.S. prison population was 93.3 percent male and 6.7 percent female. \n\nThe following day, my observation was reinforced by countless news reports about the attendance at the more than 600 marches around the world and the absence of arrests. In Washington, there were 500,000 marchers and none were locked up. (That number is not subjective. More than 470,000 people had taken the Metro, the Washington subway system, by 1 p.m., a weekend ridership record. By comparison, on Friday, Inauguration Day, there were 193,000 trips by 11 a.m., according to Metro. The swearing-in was at noon.) In Philadelphia, city officials estimate that 50,000 people participated, and the Police Department told me that none were arrested. The crowds were huge all over - 20,000 in Houston, 60,000 in Oakland, 60,000 in Atlanta, 100,000 in L.A., and 120,000 in Boston. But according to CNN, police reported only four arrests in 21 American cities. \n\nSo I decided to share my wonderment with Steven Pinker, the Harvard psychologist who has published extensively on crime. He told me that the difference in violence is one of the most robust sex differences, and that on average (across societies) men are 11 times more likely to kill other men than women are to kill other women. In his book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Decline , he wrote: \n\n\"Though in many primate species, including humans, both sexes jockey for preeminence, usually against members of their own sex, it seems to loom larger in the minds of men than in the minds of women, taking on a mystical status as a priceless commodity worth almost any sacrifice. . . . \n\n\"And men are, of course, by far the more violent sex. Though the exact ratios vary, in every society it is the males more than the females who play-fight, bully, fight for real, carry weapons, enjoy violent entertainment, fantasize about killing, kill for real, rape, start wars, and fight in wars. Not only is the direction of the sex difference universal, but the first domino is almost certainly biological. The difference is found in most other primates, emerges in toddlerhood, and may be seen in boys who (because of anomalous genitalia) are secretly raised as girls.\" \n\nFifteen minutes past Wilmington came the announcement: \"Next stop, Philadelphia's 30th Street Station.\" Around me women gathered their belongings, many retrieving signs, including my favorite: \"March Like a Girl.\" \n\nWhen the doors opened the platform quickly became a sea of pink. At the top of the escalator there were hugs and handshakes and people headed their separate ways. The station was busy for a Saturday night, but like the march, without incident. I headed for my car without looking over my shoulder. \n\n\"This doesn't mean that a train full of drunken post-demonstration men would inevitably fight, but the odds would certainly be higher than in the train you rode on,\" Pinker told me. \n\nBut chances are, if I'd been with 600 guys, the theme song wouldn't have been \"Peace Train.\" It would have been \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting.\" \n\nMichael Smerconish can be heard 9 a.m. to noon on SiriusXM's POTUS Channel 124. He hosts \"Smerconish\" at 9 a.m. Saturdays on CNN.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michael Smerconish"},"topics":[{"name":"Delaware Valley news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Smerconish: After the march, all aboard the Peace Train","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201066552","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Lincoln (telegraphy), FDR (radio), and JFK (television) precede the 45th president on that list. \n\nIn the 18th century, however, it was another medium that allowed partisans to (relatively) quickly and cheaply reach their supporters: the pamphlet. A grisly example of this is the 1763 Conestoga Massacre and ensuing \"Paxton Pamphlet War.\" \n\nMuch is rightly made of William Penn's overtures to Native Americans. Unlike many of his colonial counterparts, Penn negotiated in good faith to create a \"peaceable kingdom.\" \n\nThe Quaker's sentiments were far from universally shared. Settling on Native American lands in violation of established agreements, the deluge of Europeans soon sundered whatever goodwill remained. The French and Indian War and Pontiac's Rebellion didn't exactly improve relations, either. \n\nOn paper, the governor's writ extended throughout the colony. In reality, for those living along the Susquehanna Valley frontier, the Philadelphia-based government might as well have been on the moon. \n\nChiding the pacifist city-dwelling Quakers as weak, effete, and unsympathetic to their problems, a militia of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of the Paxtang settlement (today's Harrisburg suburbs) took matters into its own hands in 1763. \n\nThe \"Paxton Boys,\" as the band of brigands came to be known, marched to the nearby settlement of the Conestoga tribe and murdered every man, woman, and child they encountered. The mob then broke into the Lancaster jailhouse - where many Conestoga had sought safety - to continue their brutal campaign. A vow to march on Philadelphia soon followed. \n\nThe 250-plus strong banditti were halted in Germantown by none other than Benjamin Franklin. With a promise to read the Paxton Boys' pamphlet of concerns in Philadelphia's legislative chamber, the \"demonstrators\" disbanded. \n\nThe incident, however, was far from over. \n\nA heated debate between Paxton supporters and detractors kicked off in the era's media of choice: pamphlets, broadsides, and political cartoons. By the end of 1764, the \"Paxton Pamphlet War\" made up more than a fifth of all material printed in Pennsylvania. \n\n\"At its crux, the Paxton revolt presented a crisis of representation through which backcountry settlers rebelled against an authority that they held to be unfit, unresponsive, or simply indifferent to their needs,\" said Will Fenton, the Albert Greenfield fellow at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. \n\nThe fault lines were manifold: European vs. Native American, settler vs. city-dweller, \"Presbyterian militancy\" vs. \"Quaker passivity.\" \n\nPaxton supporters called attention to the greed and hypocrisy of \"crooked\" Quaker merchants and politicians, taking up arms to defend themselves against the Paxton Boys but opposing military aid for those on the frontier. \n\nIn one popular cartoon, prominent Quaker Abel James hands out tomahawks to the Conestoga while another member of the Society of Friends embraces a bare-chested Native American woman. \n\nAnti-Paxton politicians, for their part, ridiculed the Scotch-Irish settlers for their vulgarity and lack of education. Racialized as \"more savage than the Indians themselves,\" the frontiersmen are depicted as ignorant with a \"backward\" manner of speaking. \n\nThe Conestoga \"would even have been safer among the Negroes of Africa, where at least one manly soul would have been found, with sense, spirit, and humanity enough, to stand in their defense,\" Franklin wrote, employing racist stereotypes in order to elevate the peaceful Conestoga and scold those sympathetic to the Paxton Boys. \n\nIn the end, none of the murderers was tried or convicted. \n\nA Ph.D. candidate in English, Fenton worked over the past year to create the Digital Paxton project (digitalpaxton.org), a free resource featuring dozens of the pamphlets and cartoons, as well as accompanying essays and transcriptions. \n\nFor him, the contemporary parallels are clear. \n\n\"The term elite , weaponized in the 2016 election, figured heavily in the Paxton debate,\" said Fenton, while \"many pamphleteers stoked debate anonymously, in much the same way that provocateurs hide behind Twitter handles.\" \n\n\"In the context of the Brexit vote and the rise of right-wing nationalist movements across the West, [we] would do well to study this incident and to critically engage pamphleteers' zero-sum views of race, class, and cosmopolitanism,\" he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Delaware Valley news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"When pamphlets were media of choice","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201068307","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"caption":"A cartoon reflects the divide between Quakers and other colonists, who felt the Quakers were unsympathetic to their problems.

Lionel Messi\u2019s crew are within striking distance of Real Madrid, and a victory over Real Betis on Jan. 29 will get them closer to first place. Can they do it? Tune in to find out.  \nGoing into Week 20 of the 2016-17 La Liga season, Real Madrid remains on top of the table, but Sevilla and Barcelona are gaining on Los Blancos. While Cristiano Ronaldo , 31, and his team take on Real Sociedad , and Sevilla is busy with Espanyol , Lionel Messi , 29, Neymar , 24, and Luis Suarez , 29, will see if they can take a chomp out of Real Betis \u2013 and Real Madrid\u2019s lead.

Even when his rival, Ronaldo, loses, he overshadows the Barca superstar. Real Madrid were on a record-setting 40-game undefeated streak when they ran smack into Sevilla. After losing to Sevilla for the first time in this La Liga season, they fell 2-1 to Celta Vigo in the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal. Many expected them to bounce back, but in the second game, Celta held Ronaldo\u2019s crew to a 2-2 draw. Real has been eliminated from tournament! \n \nReal Betis was in the news, as the team\u2019s left-back, Riza Durmisi , 23, has drawn the eye of Liverpool . Riza has a £17million buyout clause on his contract, meaning that he would come at a hefty price. These reports of the Reds\u2019 interest come after the team\u2019s manager shot down the idea that he\u2019s shopping for more players in that position. \n \n\u201cWhat I can say is that I didn\u2019t think for a second until now about another left-back,\u201d Jurgen Klopp, 49, said earlier in January, according to This Is In Anfield . \u201cWe are always looking for players but in this moment we have two left-backs\u2014 [James Milner ] is one and Alberto Moreno the other.\u201d \n \nIf Riza goes all Wu-Tang on Barcelona and scores like he\u2019s powered by the Shaolin, he might be too attractive of an offer for Jurgern to pass up.

Gentry said he felt badly for Portland G Damian Lillard and C.J.

Frank Sargeant    \nCrappies are not hard to catch if you know where to find them. The problem often is finding them--with the traditional method of lowering live minnows around channel edges and underwater structure, it's possible to go all day and never hit that motherlode of keepers, particularly in cold weather. \n \nTrolling, on the other hand, allows covering lots of water and hopefully by the law of averages eventually coming across that big school of keeper-size crappies that will fill the cooler. Guide Mark Collins at Weiss Lake, among other experts, frequently relies on the tactic at this time of year. \n \nCrappies for the most part hang out in deeper water during the winter in North Alabama, typically suspending in tight schools at depths of 12 to 16 feet, often off the edge of river ledges or where blackwater creeks dump into the main lakes. \n \nThey have to eat, and so they're often found close to balls of shad or other bait. The shad are easier to see than the crappies on a sonar--they often form schools that stretch for many yards, making an obvious cloud on the depthfinder screen. \n \nAreas where there are several of these schools are made to order for winter trolling. The trick is choosing the right weight of lure and the right gear so that it gets down to the fish. Crappies don't generally eat large baits--jigs of 1/8 to 1/32 ounce, tipped with tiny soft plastics from 2 to 2.5 inches long, are pretty much the universal lures for trolling. \n \nThe right speed is critical--most gasoline outboards won't idle slowly enough to allow crappie trolling. An electric trolling motor, set at a power that produces 1 to 2 mph--about half of walking speed--is a part of success. (The GPS systems on most sonars these days will accurately measure speeds as low as you care to go, and allow you to repeat that speed both upwind and down.) \n \nSo is combining lure, line weight and line length to put the lure down where the fish are. The lighter the line and the more that's let out, the deeper a given lure will run. Six-pound-test gets deeper than 8 at the same speed and distance from the boat. \n \nMost crappie trolling experts put out a spread of four to six rods, each with a slightly different offering set at a different depth. Bladed baits like the RoadRunner--a winter favorite--run a bit shallower than straight jigs like the Gene Larew or those from Wally Marshall. \n \nColor matters with crappies. Some days they want only white-and-chartreuse, other days only black-and-chartreuse, some days pearl-and-blue. It's a good idea to set out a selection of colors, then switch all the rods to the color that produces first. \n \nOnce you see that one rod is producing with a given lure weight, color and line length, all the rigs can be set out at that length and you can get down to the work of filling the cooler. \n \nWhen the bite slows down in trolling, it's also possible to use the sonar to get right on top of the school, anchor and drop live minnows down to just above the crappies. On a big school, it usually doesn't take long to finish off the 30-fish limit with this tactic. \n \nTrolling is not only a winter tactic, but it also works in early spring as the fish begin their move towards the shallows to spawn. And, it becomes effective again in summer as the shallows heat up, pushing the fish back to the channel edges.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Frank Sargeant"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Winter trolling for crappies on North Alabama lakes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hudson","zipCode":"07311","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jersey City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Birmingham News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"355402167","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7113"},"name":"Birmingham News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://al.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201077200","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

So when he made the runs and was fighting with the defender, that was a very important moment for me.\" \n \nThe injury had been Welbeck's second affecting the same knee since joining Arsenal in 2014 and Wenger was relieved the player had not shown any psychological ill-effects. \n \n'Delighted' \n \n\"He worked very hard,\" Wenger said of the 26-year-old Welbeck. \"He went through some moments of very deep disappointment when he had the setback and we had to go in again in the knee, when you are a professional football player that is very difficult. But after the first disappointment he worked even harder. \n \n\"He is highly respected inside the club because he has shown so much dedication and never moaned. He has worked very hard and everybody is delighted for him.\" \n \nBut even Wenger had his doubts over whether Welbeck would come back a second time. \"You wonder and I wondered,\" he admitted. \n \nThe dominant overall display of his team, which featured encouraging performances from Jeff Reine-Adelaide and Ainsley Maitland-Niles in midfield, meant Wenger could relax in the directors' box during the first game of his four-match touchline ban for pushing fourth official Anthony Taylor during the 2-1 league victory over Burnley on January 22. \n \n\"Yes, it was pleasant to watch,\" he said. \"We had individually strong performances, and collectively as well. It was a good opportunity to see some players who came back like Welbeck and see some young players in midfield who did very well.\" \n \nBoth managers had made 10 changes to the teams that had played their previous matches but Saints' young side was no match for Arsenal's more experienced XI. \n \nBut with his side reaching a Wembley final by beating Liverpool in the last four of the League Cup at Anfield in midweek, Southampton manager Claude Puel insisted he had little choice over his team selection. \n \n\"It was difficult today,\" said Puel, a former protege of compatriot Wenger. \"At the start the players were nervous and every situation was difficult,\" the Frenchman added. \n \n\"The second half was better but without reward. \n \n\"Before the game we had nine players not available and to play always the same players is not possible. \n \n\"Of course I'm disappointed for the young players, but it's a good lesson for the future.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Arsenal news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Premier League news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"FA Cup: Arsene Wenger 'delighted' with Danny Welbeck after 5-0 thumping of Southampton","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"232003819","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"Firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201082253","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The two held unofficial talks in New York last November shortly after Trump's U.S. presidential election victory. \n \n\"I want us to have a frank exchange of views on the economy and security in our meeting,\" Abe told reporters after speaking with Trump on Saturday for 42 minutes. \n \nA Japanese government official quoted Abe as telling Trump that he \"hopes the United States will become a greater country through (your) leadership,\" adding Japan wants to \"fulfill our role as your ally.\" \n \nTrump told Abe the United States considers Japan an extremely important partner, and feels the alliance between the countries is of high importance, the official said. \n \nThe two leaders also committed to deepening the bilateral trade and investment relationship, according to the White House. \n \nDuring the call, Abe explained to Trump the contributions of Japanese automakers to the U.S. economy, the official said without elaborating, while another government source said Trump asked Abe to urge Japanese companies to create more jobs in the United States. \n \nSince his inauguration, Trump has accused Japan of conducting trade practices in the automobile sector that are \"not fair\" to U.S. companies. Trump administration threats to impose a 20 percent tariff on various products made in Mexico and shipped to the United States could also adversely affect Japanese automobile and auto parts makers with plants there. \n \nAfter Trump criticized Toyota Motor Corp. this month for building a second vehicle assembly plant in Mexico, Japan's biggest automaker quickly announced it would invest $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years. \n \nTrump and Abe did not specifically discuss the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal from which Trump withdrew the United States through an executive order this past week, according to a Japanese official. \n \nTrump has said he favors bilateral deals over the TPP, which he called a \"disaster\" for the United States, while Abe has hailed both the TPP's promised economic benefits and strategic importance in setting a fair standard for regional trade.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 38 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Palm Beach","zipCode":"33410","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Palm Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WPBF","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"name":"WPBF","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wpbf.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201088809","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Generations of excited fans came with a line the lead up to the Baltimore Convention Center for Orioles FanFest, where a fan could get a chance to see a little of everything \u2014 and lots of it in orange and black.   Including a suit worn by diehard O\u2019s fan Ryan King.    \u201cA lot of orange, I love to see that,\u201d says King.    He\u2019s wearing a bright orange suit, complete with orange top hat.   \u201cOnly a few occasions I bring it out, it\u2019s for formal wear: FanFest, opening day, and god willing, post-season,\u201d he says.   While as eye-catching as it is, the day was not about decked-out fans, but the Orioles players too. And everywhere you looked you saw fans getting a chance to meet the players they to root for all season.   Those same fans also got to see some of the faces they see every day on WJZ .  As part of our continuing community commitment, many of WJZ\u2019s on-air staff, like Rick Ritter, Bob Turk, Devin Bartolotta and Tim Williams took pictures with O\u2019s fans.   FanFest is a day that many wait for all year.   \u201cAnd get a lot of free stuff too, which is good.\u201d says Ihotsky.   Orioles FanFest has been around since 1988.

Beauty mares can strike at any time, as the following cautionary tales reflect...\n\n\"Other people probably wouldn\u2019t put it down as a \u2018disaster\u2019, but probably the most upsetting thing that has ever happened to me was when a hairdresser cut off all my hair to chin-length without asking me. I was about 26, and my hair was probably a few inches below my shoulders. I was pushed by a PR to go and see a \u2018celebrity\u2019 hairdresser I hadn\u2019t met before, (big mistake), and I explained that I was thinking of having a long bob, probably cut to the bottom of my neck. The hairdresser and I got chatting about his family and his love of football and before I knew it, he had lopped off one side above my chin level. He finished the whole head and stupidly I left without saying a word to avoid confrontation. What could I do about it anyway I thought as I kicked through my lovely hair strewn all over the salon floor?\"\n\n\"When I got home I sobbed to my husband when I looked in the mirror and realised how damn short it was and how I couldn\u2019t get it to reach into a ponytail. Weirdly, a few months later, I went to a product launch that the hairdresser was an ambassador for. He came up to me and said \u2018I\u2019m so so sorry but last time I saw you I realised I cut off all your hair without you asking\u2019.I guess at least he admitted it but I learned right then that we can\u2019t underestimate how much our hair is part of the way we feel about ourselves. I also learned that no matter how famous a hairdresser, always ask them to show you exactly how much they are about to cut off (i.e, get them to point to precisely where they are cutting it) before they begin.\"\n\n\"I was broke and a student - a deadly duo when it comes to the world of beauty experimentation. I remember it vividly - the sun was shining and it was a slow Saturday afternoon and so with time on my hands and a pair of scissors in them, I tentatively tried to channel my inner stylist and seek as much bang for my buck as possible. In fact, for no buck at all, but oh how I wished I\u2019d dug a little deeper and asked somebody, anybody to stop me in my snip-happy tracks. \u2018It\u2019s just a trim\u2019 I said, \u2018It\u2019ll only take a second\u2019 I told myself. However, fast forward ten minutes later and there I was, looking in disbelief at the mound of black hair that sat in my sink and my reflection in the murky mirror in my halls of residence. With the cool air conditioning caressing the bottom two thirds of my forehead like a summer breeze, and the remnants of my thick but stubby fringe bouncing up almost in shock at the actions of its foolish owner, I knew that this was one of those moments I\u2019d look back on and laugh about someday. And I think I\u2019m just about able to do that now. Just.\"\n\n\"Let's face it, bikini waxes aren't pleasant at the best of times. That pulsating pain, red raw skin and slight sting of the aloe vera aftermath are best quickly forgotten. Unfortunately, there's one bikini wax \"experience\" I'll never forget.\"\n\n\"It all started when I couldn't get an appointment with my regular salon and decided to nip round the corner to a place that could take me right away. I did have my suspicions when I turned up and the receptionist said that the beautician was running late and, after sitting in the waiting room for 20 minutes, then guided me through to one of the treatment rooms and announced that she (the receptionist that is) would do the wax for me to save time. In hindsight I should have legged it then and there, but I suppose I just assumed she must have the appropriate training or naturally wouldn't be offering!\"\n\n\"Sadly, I was sorely(!) mistaken. As she began applying the wax haphazardly to my delicate bikini line I remember thinking how incredibly hot the wax seemed, but with true British reservedness and not wanting to offend, I sat tight, tried to think about my upcoming holiday, and let her continue. Sadly, my daydream was abruptly interrupted with the shrill shriek of the beautician (a.k.a. receptionist) who was holding her hands over my bikini line in shock. I sat up with a start to see what all the commotion was, only to find that her last swipe of the wax strip had quite literally skinned me alive! My bikini line was now bleeding profusely. In a panic she started bundling cotton wool all over me, which only made things worse as it stuck to all the residual bits of now blood soaked wax. She then ran out of the room to go and find the (presumably) qualified beautician who duly came running in and helped to stem the flow. After many sheepish apologies they graciously announced that there would be no charge for the appointment - I should think not!\"\n\n\"Not only was I physically and emotionally scarred, but my poolside glamour was entirely ruined by their hack job - a true beauty disaster!\"\n\n\"My fascination with fake tan began young, perhaps because the thought of turning my Celtic skintone full-on Gisele in a matter of hours seems like pure MAGIC. As usual, with any magical or miraculous concept or product, the reality is never as slick as you\u2019d like to imagine.\"\n\n\"One particular and definitively non-slick faux glow incident that sticks out in my mind was when I was around eleven (told you I started young) and went on a faraway holiday with my Dad. I was determined to return looking all mysterious and tanned, so I set off to The Body Shop on landing and spent my pocket money on the darkest self-tan on the shop floor. I believe I applied it with a Holiday Inn flannel, leaving it to develop overnight. On waking, I was a patchwork quilt of mahogany, ghostly white and random dribbly bits, plus the flannel action had created a very odd, dappled cheetah kind of effect. What\u2019s worse, it STANK (this was the mid 90s), and once the itch set it, it dawned on me that I must also be allergic to it. Suffice to say that adding red, angry bumps to the mix didn\u2019t enhance my supermodel \u2018glow\u2019.\"\n\n\"Bless my Dad, he said nada, zilch, nothing, which probably indicates how dire the situation actually was. For some bizarre reason I also decided to get some cornrows put in on that holiday, and then I burnt my head in the sun and started to peel between the braids. It\u2019s fair to say that the playground was NOT my catwalk when I got home, but in a very trite and cheesy ending to the tale, I also learned that attempting pretty much a 360º on your looks to impress others is no way to live.\"\n\n\"I was sent to trial an (expensive) new salon in Kensington about six years ago and asked for a bit of colour to cover up the emerging grey at my hairline and \u2018a couple of highlights\u2019 to perk me up. The colorist wanted to go a bit lighter, so I asked him to show me the equivalent colour in a magazine. He picked out a beach picture of a woman emerging from the the sea Ursula Andress-style with darkish wet hair, but nevertheless how I imagined my own might look with highlights. Clearly he was looking at this woman thinking, \u2018when dry, her hair will look yellow, like Big Bird.\"\n\n\"I naturally have mid-brown hair, and you can imagine my horror when he started blow drying the balayage to reveal the new \u2018Easter chick\u2019 me (that\u2019s chick as in yellow fluffy thing, not hot babe). I was so shocked that I didn\u2019t say anything; I was rather taken in by the swankiness of the salon, wondering whether everyone else thought it was \u2018fabulous dahling\u2019 and I was just not on-trend enough to appreciate that particular shade of jaundice. By the time I got home, I had scraped my hair back into a ponytail (the balayage had left my roots dark) hiding as much of the yellow as I could from my family. Scraped really was the operative word; my hair was so bleached that my comb got stuck in it. That\u2019s how it remained for a few weeks until I plucked up the courage to go back to the salon to have a vegetable dye to turn it back to brown and spent the next two years growing out the poor condition.\"\n\n\"Note to self: stick with a colourist you trust before you say yes to a new look. I now go to Charlie Double at colour specialists Four London and would trust her with my life.\"\n\n\"In my humble opinion, I have avoided quite a few beauty disasters thanks to having two older sisters who made their mistakes first - I could live vicariously through them as they covered their entire eyelids in liquid eyeliner, pulled out their eyelashes and wore a concealer three shades too dark (no offence sisters). I\u2019ve had my fair share of beauty experiments (white eyeshadow, anyone?) but they were so of their time that I\u2019m not sure I could call them disastrous.\"\n\n\"For me, a beauty disaster is when something goes horribly wrong, such as the many mishaps involving my sensitive skin; the worst I can think of is a trip to a plush London spa, where I was treated to a complimentary leg scrub, wrap and massage just in time for summer. They used really, really, REALLY strong essential oils and products and as it was one of my first press visits I was too nervous to question anything, and the scrub (with a bristle brush of some sort) was so abrasive and the oils so potent that I could feel the tingles as I laid there trying to look relaxed. My legs promptly erupted into the worst allergic reaction I\u2019d ever seen, and not only did my GP struggle to prescribe anything that would help in time for the hot weather, but my skin was left blotchy and marked for years to come. It was a long time before I would go bare-legged again and I swore off spas (not that that\u2019s particularly hard) for years until I felt brave enough to try another treatment - but I\u2019ll never be able to fully relax at a spa again!\"\n\n\"This is almost ten years ago now but the memory still feels FRESH, and I mean vivid. Some friends invited me to a \"Holi\" party (Hindu festival of spring, also known as festival of colours). I knew a little bit about what happened at this festival, but being a newbie in Bombay, where I was living at the time, I don\u2019t think I really understood the full story. Some friends had given me a gentle reminder to apply some oil to my hair beforehand to protect my blonde locks. \u2018Oil in my hair? I don\u2019t want to look like a greaseball when I arrive at this fabulous colour party..!\u2019 I thought to myself as I swiftly ignored this (key) piece of advice. \u2018They\u2019re just messing with me..I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\n\n\"So I arrived at with my hair perfectly coiffed, only to be greeted by an assault of pigment powders\u2026that\u2019s right PIGMENT. Blue, orange, yellow, green..you name it, I was covered in it. Then for the final blow (to complete the cultural exchange) \u2013 a bucket of pink water over the head..whoosh! All mega lolz until I got home that night and couldn\u2019t for the life of me wash any of the colour off my body or hair. I literally looked like Rainbow Brite\u2019s scraggy sister. For months I think people were wondering a) why in god\u2019s name I had dyed my hair pink and b) how had it gone so badly wrong. For future reference - the clue is in the name: PIGMENT!\"\n\nWhat the worst/ funniest thing that\u2019s happened to you beauty wise?

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 39 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201099020","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Proving you don't always get what you wish for. \n \nRETRO DREAMING \n \nTwo finals between the most compelling thirty somethings 'rivals' in the game, unseen for ten years in grand slam finals. Even if nothing else happened, Roger and Rafa in the final was enough but on top of that: Serena and Venus played a final; thirties were the new twenties with all finalists and most of the quarter-finalists aged thirty something; the world number one got beaten by a serve volleyer; oh and Ash Barty was playing WBBL cricket this time last year. \n \nTHE RETURN OF THE SERVE VOLLEY \n \nThe Zverev brothers made the biggest statement of this Open. Sascha because at 19 he has a game, as he showed in losing to Rafa, that will take him to tennis' peak. And Mischa because he played a game against Andy Murray that made many wonder if serve volley was back. \n \nIn Melbourne the courts and balls were faster. So Ivo Karlovic set a new Australian Open record for most aces in a match (75 against Horacio Zabellas). Games were taking less time than Rafa takes picking at his undies. \n \nTHE EFFIN' COMEBACK \n \nEff me if she didn't f'n make the f'n semis. FFS. Lucic-Baroni delivered the most candid on court post-match interview making her first quarter final in twenty years. \n \nAsked how she persisted for so long against so many obstacles she replied: \"Eff everything and everybody whoever tells you you can't do it. Just show up and win in your heart.\" \n \nShe then won her next match and this time tearfully hinted more at the back story for why the woman dubbed the next Steffi Graf had not realised that potential for 20 years. \n \nTWEET TWEET \n \nRoger does everything the best, even tweets. Federer tweeted a video of his new boy band \u2013 him, Gregor Dimitrov and Tommy Haas - singing \"How to say I'm Sorry\". \n \nALL ADVICE WELCOME, NOT HEEDED \n \nIf losing after imploding on the court wasn't enough Mark Philippoussis giving career advice on how to right his career has to be Nick Kyrgios' penny drop moment. \n \nHis meltdown loss to Andreas Seppi came after being up two sets to one and a break. Afterwards he admitted, finally, that hey being the only player in the top 100 without a coach might not be the smartest move. \n \nWHO ARE YOU WEARING? \n \nEven Daria 'Dasha' Gavrilova did a double take when she appeared on court against Timea Bacsinszky wearing identical outfits. \n \n\"It's a bit weird, but what can we do?,\" she said. \n \nIt sent social media buzzing in the way only the truly irrelevant can and was only outdone by Mirka Federer's jumper choice - a pink and green Gucci number with the words L'aveugle par amour, (\"blind love\", or \"blinded by love\") written on it. Big in central europe but not so pleasing to tennis fans it seems. \n \nTHE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT?\" \n \nThings got testy on court between bustling Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka who is ordinarily as deadpan as a fondue bowl. \n \nTsonga muttered about Wawrinka giving him greasy looks. \n \n\"I looked at you when? Did I look at you at all? It's a tennis match. You've got to calm down, relax a bit.\" Wawrinka protested quite reasonably. \n \n\"There's no worries,\" Tsonga said. But plainly there is. \n \nThe pair both live in Switzerland and had been close but things went awry a few years ago after Stan's first slam when Tsonga was quoted in L'Equipe saying \"If Stan can win a slam, then I deserve one too\". \n \nADIEU \n \nAnd with that we bid adieu to Australian Open 2017. Welcome back next year when Pat Rafter and Pete Sampras are favourites to play in the final on a green court.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michael Gleeson"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017: The hits and misses of the tournament","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201102569","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Aggies played strong defense from start to finish, in a game fueled by over 100 young Aggie fans in attendance that were a part of the morning kid\u2019s clinic hosted by the coaches and players. \n\nAfter guiding the Aggies to their eighth straight win, head coach Mark Trakh commented on the game saying, \u201cWe spread the ball around well against the zone defense and came up with big shots to win today.\u201d \n\nThe game opened up slow on the offensive end throughout the first half, as each team\u2019s defense made scoring tough. In the first quarter, NM State forced 10 turnovers and Utah Valley forced six as each team shots under 35 percent from the field. After forcing four steals and adding three blocks, the quarter ended tied at seven. \n\nThroughout the second quarter, the scoring totals from each team improved, but the defensive play from each squad kept the game close. NM State was able to end the half ahead, 22-21. \n\nThe one point lead was built off of strong play in the paint, outscoring the opponent 10-2 and seeing strong production off the bench leading the Wolverines, 10-1.  Heading to the locker room, the Aggies saw nine players contribute to the scoring, led by Gia Pack with five points. \n\nNew Mexico State came out with a different mindset in the second half, looking to run things around. The Aggie defense ran press throughout the quarter, forcing the Wolverines to make mistakes, which the team capitalized on. \n\nBrooke Salas, in particular, took over in the third quarter as she put up 14 points in ten minutes, including nine of the Aggies final 11. The play from the sophomore guard allowed the Aggies to finish the quarter on an 11-2 run and head into the final quarter ahead, 48-36. \n\nMuch like the first three quarters, the fourth was all about defense as the Aggies held the Wolverines scoreless until the 6:58 mark. Aside from strong defense, the major point of the fourth quarter came when senior Moriah Mack knocked down her fifth basket of the game. This play late in the fourth made Mack the 22nd player in NM State history to score 1,000 career points, joining fellow teammate Brianna Freeman who accomplished the feat on Jan. 7 against Chicago State. \n\nThe team was able to close out the game on top of Utah Valley, 63-46. The victory saw the Aggies outscore the Wolverines with points in the paint (28-16), points off of turnovers (15-6), second chance points (18-11) and points off the bench (14-6). \n\nThis victory moves New Mexico State to 15-6 overall and a conference best, 7-0 in WAC play. The team\u2019s next contest will see them travel to take on Chicago State on Saturday, Feb. 4, at 1 p.m. MT. This will be the second time the two teams have squared off this season, as the Aggies brought home a 100-63 victory earlier in the month.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andy Morgan"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NMSU WBB Adds Another Victory on a Historic Night","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"El Paso","zipCode":"79902","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"El Paso","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ElPasoProud","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"545618025","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"ElPasoProud","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.elpasoproud.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201106083","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Thundering Herd (12-8, 4-5 C-USA) led 17-12 after 10 minutes of action but the Miners (6-14, 3-5 C-USA) had a +20 differential (30-10) in the second quarter to cruise into the locker room armed with a 42-27 advantage. The cushion swelled to as many as 21 (56-35, 4:40 3Q) and the visitors never truly threatened the rest of way. \n \n  \n \nSparkle Taylor (25 points, four assists), Tamara Seda (15 points, 12 rebounds), Zuzanna Puc (12 points, 11 rebounds), Katarina Zec (career-high tying 11 points, career-high five assists) and Lulu McKinney (10 points, six assists) keyed the charge for the Miners. \n \n  \n \nUTEP shot 40.8 percent (29-71) from the floor, won the boards (46-45) and converted 19 Marshall turnovers into 28 points to secure a big bounce-back win. The Miners racked up 23 assists on the 29 made field goals while also committing only 13 turnovers. \n \n  \n \nShayna Gore tallied a game-high 26 points to pace the Herd, but no other Herd player had more than 11 points. \n \n  \n \n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our team and we needed this win,\u201d UTEP head coach Keitha Adams said. \u201cTo have five players in double figures, that was huge. We had a great second quarter; it\u2019s probably the best 10 minutes of basketball we\u2019ve played this year. I thought it was a gut check game. Our young team is starting to understand our system and gaining a lot of experience.\u201d \n \n  \n \nThe 30-point burst was the Miners\u2019 second-highest scoring total in a quarter (32 vs. WNMU) this year and ranks four on the program\u2019s single-game records. \n \n  \n \nJakeira Ford (five points), Ax Bernard (three points, two rebounds) and Faith Cook (two assists, no turnovers) made some contributions at key times to help buoy the starters. \n \n  \n \nIt was back-and-forth play for most of the opening frame, with three ties and three lead changes, before Marshall used consecutive three pointers (McKenzie Akers, 1:35 & Gore, 00:39) to surge ahead by five (17-12). The difference remained five (19-14, 9:28 2Q) before a Taylor jumper and an old-fashioned three-point by Ford (assist to Cook) knotted the contest at 19. \n \n  \n \nMarshall nailed another triple to regain the lead but UTEP ripped off eight straight points to vault back ahead. The Miners were just getting warmed up, though, with a 9-0 run late in the quarter essentially delivering the knockout punch. \n \n  \n \nThe visitors had aspirations of mounting a comeback, but UTEP kept its composure even as the Herd made some charges. Marshall managed to trim the deficit to eight on a pair of occasions but it could get no closer. \n \n  \n \nThe Miners will now face the daunting task of playing four straight league road games for the first time since 2005-06 (initial year in C-USA). Upon conclusion of the trip, UTEP will have had seven of nine away from home. The sequence starts at UAB at 6 p.m. MST/7 p.m. CST Thursday, with Duke Keith on the call for 600 ESPN El Paso.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"UTEP WBB Thunders Past Marshall, 84-74","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"El Paso","zipCode":"79902","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"El Paso","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ElPasoProud","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"545618025","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"ElPasoProud","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.elpasoproud.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201106323","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2013 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2013 were taken by the Indian President \u2026\u2026(deleted),\u201d it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Rajiv\u2019s mediation efforts to resolve \u201cthe conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo.\u201d Besides Gandhi\u2019s possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \u201cabrupt departure\u201d from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\u201cAlthough we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv\u2019s tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\u201d it said while listing out several other possibilities including \u201chis death from natural causes or by accident\u201d. \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \u201cto resign out of frustration\u201d, saying \u201cwe see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\u201d. \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \u201cWe suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate \u2014 as we do \u2014 that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\u201d \n \nIn a section called \u201cImplications for the United States\u201d, the report says, \u201cWe believe (Rajiv) Gandhi\u2019s death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession. We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv\u2019s assassination.\u201d \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv\u2019s policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology among others, and their outcome. \n \n\u201cAlthough some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\u201d it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \u201cnational government\u201d taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act. \n \nPTI","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"CIA assessed Rajiv Gandhi assassination 5 years before he was killed","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Siasat Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169680243","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Siasat Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.siasat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201108133","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sonia-Gandhi.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

scored 25 points and Dominic Artis added 24 points and 11 rebounds, as UTEP handed Marshall its first loss at home this season, 91-68, on Saturday night at the Cam Henderson Center. \n \n  \n \nThe Miners (6-16, 4-4 C-USA) got a much-needed split of their road trip while notching their first road victory of the season. \n \n  \n \nMarshall (13-9, 6-3 C-USA), which entered the game tied for second place in C-USA, fell to 11-1 at home with only its third loss in the last 24 games in Huntington. \n \n  \n \nThe Herd was held 20 points below its season average.    Marshall, averaging a C-USA best 10.6 three-pointers per game, shot 3-for-25 from beyond the arc.   The three triples were a season low for the Herd. \n \n  \n \n\u201cI just thought we caught them on a night, they probably looked at our record and thought we stunk, and for the most part we have this year,\u201d UTEP coach Tim Floyd said.   \u201cI thought when they got it close and missed a couple of free throws it really hurt them.   They had some really nice open looks that they couldn\u2019t get down, including a missed layup, shots that Marshall normally makes.\u201d   \n \n  \n \nBut give the Miners credit, they trailed only once at 2-0 and, after seeing a 15-point lead dwindle to three early in the second half, they went on a 12-0 run and were in command the rest of the way. \n \n  \n \nWillms had some road trip.   After scoring 27 points at WKU on Thursday, he made 11-of-15 shots against the Herd while adding seven rebounds for the Miners, who absolutely throttled Marshall on the glass (45-29).   Willms averaged 26.0 ppg for the week, made 24-of-31 shots in the two games and will be a strong contender for Conference USA Player of the Week on Monday. \n \n  \n \nArtis was 11-for-16 from the floor while collecting 11 rebounds.   Omega Harris scored 13 points and Paul Thomas 11 for UTEP, which held on despite being forced to mix and match lineups in the second half with Thomas, Willms and Kelvin Jones all in foul trouble. \n \n  \n \nJones was key off the bench with five points, five rebounds and two blocks in 13 minutes, and Deon Barrett came alive at the right time, scoring seven points on perfect shooting (2-for-2 FGs, 1-for-1 3FGs, 2-for-2 FTs) in 21 minutes. \n \n  \n \n\u201cWe got a really nice floor game out of our two guards tonight, Artis and Harris,\u201d Floyd said.   \u201cBest floor game they have had this year.   They did a nice job.   Kelvin Jones gave us some great minutes when Paul Thomas fouled out.   We went with the two bigs during that stretch and I thought he really helped us on the defensive boards.   He didn\u2019t hurt us defensively.   We worried about chasing them with those two big guys, and they were able to stay between them and the basket for the most part.   He made a couple of nice feeds inside to Matt.\u201d   \n \n  \n \nWillms has gotten his conditioning in order and established himself as a dominant force in C-USA this week. \n \n  \n \n\u201cMatt is emerging as a player.   This kid has got as much talent as any big guy in the country,\u201d Floyd said.   \u201cHe has just never been able to play.   He hasn\u2019t had an offseason for four years with knee [injury], and then he had a Joel Embiid foot injury.   He has never been able to lift, never been able to work out in the summer.   He didn\u2019t practice for the first two months of the year and is kind-of rounding into shape.   I have been telling people he\u2019s a great talent and he had a great weekend.   He is developing into a fine young player.\u201d \n \n  \n \nThe Miners got off to a great start, jumping out to leads of 8-2, 16-6 and 22-8.   Marshall trimmed it down to 10 (45-35) at halftime. \n \n  \n \nThe Herd outscored UTEP 14-7 over the first five and a half minutes of the second half and cut the deficit to three (52-49) on a layup by Terrence Thompson, who scored 25 points with 10 rebounds. \n \n  \n \nUTEP\u2019s ensuing 12-0 run featured six points from Artis, who scored 14 in the second half. \n \n  \n \nAfter Marshall pulled within nine (64-55) with 8:35 to go, the Miners scored five in a row to put it away. \n \n  \n \nUTEP\u2019s 91 points were a season high.   The Miners shot 60.6 percent in the first half, 57.8 percent for the game, and scored a whopping 60 points in the paint. \n \n  \n \nMarshall\u2019s starting guard tandem of Stevie Browning, Jon Elmore and Austin Loop, averaging 48 points between them, were held to 21 combined on 4-for-24 shooting from the field and 2-for-17 from three. \n \n  \n \n\u201cI thought that we closed pretty hard [on the three-point shooters],\u201d Floyd said.   \u201cWe just really respect their range.   They put 108 [points] on us last year.   It seemed like 200.   And we just really respect their range and I thought we did a pretty good job of closing and getting underneath them to where those shots, they didn\u2019t have the same rhythm maybe that they\u2019d had in the past, although a lot of them were open.   They had some open looks.   They just had one of those nights from the floor I think.\u201d \n \n  \n \nThe Miners will be home for four straight games, starting on Thursday when they host defending C-USA regular season champion UAB.   Tip-off is at 8 p.m. on \u201cJeep Jackson Tribute Night.\u201d   Fans are encouraged to wear white.   UTEP will host last year\u2019s C-USA Tournament champion and NCAA Tournament participant Middle Tennessee on Saturday at 6.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Miners Round Up Herd in Huntington,

Australian Test opener Matt Renshaw is seeking the counsel of former great Matthew Hayden for tips on how to conquer spin in India as he embarks on his first Test tour. , Renshaw is not allowing himself to be daunted by the prospect of playing on the dust bowls of the subcontinent against the world's No.1 Test nation.\n\nSince recovering from concussion, the youngster has been gearing his game for the examination by spin he will face against Virat Kohli's rampaging team. His preparation has included batting on an \"extreme\" turner at Cricket Australia's National Cricket Centre in Brisbane which was designed to exaggerate the conditions he will confront in India.\n\nRenshaw is due to fly to Dubai on Monday for Australia's pre-tour camp but not before consulting fellow Queenslander Hayden, Hayden famously mastered the sweep shot after weeks of intense practice with his brother on a specially made dusty pitch in Brisbane. His haul of 549 runs at 109.8 in three matches is the second most by an Australian in India, behind only Kim Hughes, who hit 594 runs from a six-Test series in 1979/80.\n\nWhile Australia failed to end their drought in 2001, Hayden's success on that campaign instilled great confidence in his teammates for the successful 2004 mission.\n\n\"I got his number off Andy Bichel, so I might give him a call to get a few quick pointers before I head off,\" Renshaw said. \"I'm not as experienced in the sweep shot as him. [\"I'll have] a fair bit more practice over the next couple of months.\n\nDespite honing his craft on the bouncy Gabba wicket, Renshaw says he is confident against spin, although there are no players in Australia in the class of Indian duo Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.\n\n\"I'm not too bad against spin in Australia but I've never experienced spin in India, so it's hard to say [how I will go],\" Renshaw said.\n\nUnder the watch of Queensland coach Phil Jaques, Renshaw has been preparing on a pitch that is offering more spin and bounce than what he will get in India and, in his own words, \"didn't go too badly\".\n\n\"If it's harder there, it can go into a game and it gets a bit easier,\" Renshaw said. \"There's a wicket at the NCC in the indoor nets that turns a lot more, it's a bit less realistic than the Mumbai wickets at AB [Allan Border] Field. It's not the worst thing to practice on.\"\n\nRenshaw's lack of experience on the subcontinent can be seen as a negative, though the glass half full view is it means he does not bear the scars of previous failures.\n\n\"I think it helps that I've not been there. It's a challenge. I like to get up for challenges and to love the contest,\" he said.\n\nRenshaw said he would not be concerned if asked to field in close again despite suffering concussion after being hit on the helmet at short leg during the Sydney Test.\n\nThe injury resulted in him becoming the first player to be withdrawn from a Test under Cricket Australia's stringent concussion rules.\n\n\"If I have to do it in India I wouldn't be too mentally scarred from it. I'd be trying to get a couple of catches in there and win a series,\" Renshaw said. \"They [the doctors] just said I need to stop headbutting the ball.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Matt Renshaw to consult Matthew Hayden for tips to play spin in India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2300","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Newcastle","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Newcastle Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666508","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"107"},"name":"Newcastle Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports","Cricket"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theherald.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201110301","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:40:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It said a number of civil servants\u2019 entrance examinations had failed to observe existing regulations, leaving the process exposed to bribery and corruption.\n\nIssues such as \u201cserial\u201d termination of contracts of hundreds of teachers, teachers/instructors contracted for a year not being paid, as well as scandal-ridden appointments and dismissal of teachers in provinces like Thanh Hoa, Nghe An and Ca Mau were highlighted in the report.\n\nThese issues had been a source of public criticism and disgruntlement among teachers, the report said.\n\nIt also said 26,750 teachers in public schools were \u2018redundant\u2019 (3,194 in primary schools; 21,005 and 2,551 in secondary and high schools, respectively) in several localities, while 45,000 teachers were still needed (32,600 for kindergartens; 7,824 for primary schools; 2,800 and 1,800 for secondary and high schools) in other areas.\n\nThai Binh and Quang Nam provinces had more than 1,000 \u2018redundant\u2019 teachers, while Nghe An and Thanh Hoa had a \u2019surplus\u2019 of 1,742 and 2,188 secondary school teachers. Meanwhile, HCM City and the northern province of Son La were struggling with a deficiency of thousands of kindergarten teachers. In Bac Giang and Nghe An provinces, the shortage was even higher at 2,000 and 3,300 teachers, respectively. Primary schools throughout the nation are struggling to find teachers. For instance, Ha Noi needs nearly 3,000, while Son La and Gia Lai provinces could use another 1,100 teachers each.\n\n\u201cThe mobilisation from or transfer of teachers between schools remains fraught with difficulties, due to the mismatch between the required posts and teachers\u2019 qualifications, or wide socio-economic development gaps between one locality and the other,\u201d Tu said.\n\n\u201cHaphazard signing of contracts with teachers by local governments, going against regulations, have sparked public protests. Relegating redundant teachers from secondary and high schools to kindergarten and primary schools without giving them any professional training has proved problematic, most notably in Thanh Hoa Province,\u201d he said.\n\nTu also noted that at present, foreign language was not a mandatory subject in primary schools, so foreign language teachers (mostly for English) were not on the state payroll, but on contracts.\n\nIn addition, he said, documents that set out regulations on training for teachers and managers of educational institutions were not satisfactorily comprehensive. Training programmes and materials, delivery methods, organisation of activities, or even procedures for reviewing and assessing the training that teachers and managers receive, were still outdated, not matching actual demand.\n\nArbitrary imposition\n\nThanh Hoa is one of the provinces worst-hit by the shortage of teachers, said Pham Thi Hang, Director of the provincial Department of Education and Training. She said decisions on policies or transfer of teachers must be done based on localities\u2019 inputs, not arbitrarily imposed from the top.\n\nShe said that in the 2011-2016 period, the province\u2019s payroll quota \u201chit a freeze point\u201d and the provincial department of home affairs didn\u2019t adjust this quota; so, in order to meet with changing number of students, the education department \u2018aggressively\u2019 pushed for transferring teachers from where there is a surplus to where there is a shortage.\n\nHang said that at present, the education sector did not have enough say in hiring and using educators. \"The Ministry of Home Affairs manages the recruitment and the Ministry of Finance controls the funds and monetary allocation while the education sector has to bear the ultimate responsibility for the quality of educators.\" This has posed many difficulties for the provincial education department, she said.\n\nCan\u2019t act in haste\n\nMinister of MoET, Phung Xuan Nha, stressed that \u201cteachers\u2019 quality decides the quality of education.\u201d\n\nSince the State Budget is limited, part of the investment would have to be sourced from localities themselves as well from the private sector, he said. \n\nHe said while plans were made after due consideration of all aspects, factors like unexpected fluctuations in the population, migration, the emergence of industrial parks and export-processing zones, among others, led to unforeseen changes in number of students in all grades, and the ministry was still trying to resolve this issue in the long-term with better forecasts and master plans.\n\nThe Minister also cautioned the provinces over the practice of transferring teachers from grades where there is a surplus to where there is a shortage, for example, from high school down to kindergarten schools. It might be an effective temporary solution, but quality must come first, and transferred teachers must be trained and equipped with proper skills, he said.\n\n\u201cYes, the shortage is serious, but it\u2019s not something that has come up only recently. Actions taken in haste, without careful consideration and planning, will result in potentially damaging consequences down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nIn order to ensure fairness in transferring redundant teachers, Hang said that localities in Thanh Hoa Province had been instructed to build a transparent set of standards and criteria against which teachers would be assessed by a qualified council.\n\nRegarding this year\u2019s agenda, the education minister said that the ministry would place a stronger focus on training managerial-level officers \u2013 first and foremost, directors and deputy directors of provincial and municipal departments of education and training.\n\nHe believed that with knowledge, skills, and experience in education management gained through proper training, managers would become more efficient and effective.\n\nMinister Nha pledged to conceive and organise a unified professional training programme that would be implemented nationwide for transferred teachers, instead of having to build one each year. \n\nrelated news VNS","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Vietnam news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Too many, too little: a teaching conundrum","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"VN","country":"Viet Nam"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"VietNamNet Bridge","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169769228","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"21"},"name":"VietNamNet Bridge","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Education","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://vietnamnet.vn"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201110523","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img.cdn2.vietnamnet.vn/Images/english/2017/01/24/11/20170124110716-edu1.jpg?w=100&amp;h=69"}],"video":[]}}

It is completely free, and is held the first weekend in April. There are 23 stages with local music around the French Quarter, lots of great Louisiana cuisine, and fantastic arts and crafts.

I wouldn\u2019t miss this charming festival held on the grounds of the old Sunset High School the first Saturday in May. There is a plethora of vendors selling Louisiana art, local and regional products, and of course lots of plants and herbs native to Acadiana.

Everyone loves them,\" said no-one. Anywhere. Ever. Proving you don't always get what you wish for.\n\nRETRO DREAMING\n\nTwo finals between the most compelling thirty somethings 'rivals' in the game, unseen for ten years in grand slam finals. Even if nothing else happened, Roger and Rafa in the final was enough but on top of that: Serena and Venus played a final; thirties were the new twenties with all finalists and most of the quarter-finalists aged thirty something; the world number one got beaten by a serve volleyer; oh and Ash Barty was playing WBBL cricket this time last year.\n\nTHE RETURN OF THE SERVE VOLLEY\n\nThe Zverev brothers made the biggest statement of this Open. Sascha because at 19 he has a game, as he showed in losing to Rafa, that will take him to tennis' peak. And Mischa because he played a game against Andy Murray that made many wonder if serve volley was back.\n\nIn Melbourne the courts and balls were faster. So Ivo Karlovic set a new Australian Open record for most aces in a match (75 against Horacio Zabellas). Games were taking less time than Rafa takes picking at his undies.\n\nTHE EFFIN' COMEBACK\n\nEff me if she didn't f'n make the f'n semis. FFS. Lucic-Baroni delivered the most candid on court post-match interview making her first quarter final in twenty years.\n\nAsked how she persisted for so long against so many obstacles she replied: \"Eff everything and everybody whoever tells you you can't do it. Just show up and win in your heart.\"\n\nShe then won her next match and this time tearfully hinted more at the back story for why the woman dubbed the next Steffi Graf had not realised that potential for 20 years.\n\nTWEET TWEET\n\nRoger does everything the best, even tweets. Federer tweeted a video of his new boy band \u2013 him, Gregor Dimitrov and Tommy Haas - singing \"How to say I'm Sorry\".\n\nALL ADVICE WELCOME, NOT HEEDED \n\nIf losing after imploding on the court wasn't enough Mark Philippoussis giving career advice on how to right his career has to be Nick Kyrgios' penny drop moment.\n\nHis meltdown loss to Andreas Seppi came after being up two sets to one and a break. Afterwards he admitted, finally, that hey being the only player in the top 100 without a coach might not be the smartest move.\n\nWHO ARE YOU WEARING?\n\nEven Daria 'Dasha' Gavrilova did a double take when she appeared on court against Timea Bacsinszky wearing identical outfits.\n\n\"It's a bit weird, but what can we do?,\" she said.\n\nIt sent social media buzzing in the way only the truly irrelevant can and was only outdone by Mirka Federer's jumper choice - a pink and green Gucci number with the words L'aveugle par amour, (\"blind love\", or \"blinded by love\") written on it. Big in central europe but not so pleasing to tennis fans it seems.\n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT?\"\n\nThings got testy on court between bustling Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka who is ordinarily as deadpan as a fondue bowl.\n\nTsonga muttered about Wawrinka giving him greasy looks.\n\n\"I looked at you when?

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 40 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Greenville","zipCode":"29609","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WYFF4.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659149","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"107"},"name":"WYFF4.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wyff4.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201151672","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Santi Cazorla has been missed since falling foul of injury, and the Ox surprisingly gave us something special in the role yesterday. \n \nTheo Walcott was a key member of our starting XI earlier in the campaign, which saw Alexis showcase his immense talents as a centre-forward, and I cant help but think that with the England and Arsenal winger back in the side, Giroud may well find himself demoted back to the bench in favour of that system. \n \nLucas Perez is another player who has really opened my eyes in his recent outings, combining extremely well with his fellow forwards, as well as showing a keen eye for goal, but Arsene currently seems reluctant to over-use him which is a shame. \n \nWhich of our FA Cup team do you think most deserves a shot at a permanent first-team role in the coming weeks?

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\"\n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State.\n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said.\n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone.\n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range.\n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded.\n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended.\n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room.\n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\"\n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks.\n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one.\n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game.\n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state.\n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98506","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Olympian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658445","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"962"},"name":"The Olympian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theolympian.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.theolympian.com/sports/nba/article129442759.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=Curry%2c%20Warriors%20clobber%20Clippers%2c%20144-98&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129442759.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129442759.html&title=Curry%2c+Warriors+clobber+Clippers%2c+144-98","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129442759.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fsports%2fnba%2farticle129442759.html&description=Curry%2c+Warriors+clobber+Clippers%2c+144-98&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2ftheolympian%2ffaceb","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.theolympian.com/sports/nba/article129442759.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/"],"sequenceId":"695201171690","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.theolympian.com/static/images/theolympian/facebook.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Profits were up 9 percent to $965.3 million, or $6.61 per share. Profits in the fourth quarter \u2014 October to December \u2014 rose 2 percent, with revenue of $2.9 billion. Though the figure is about 3 percent higher compared to the same period in 2015, the reported net income of $255.5 million was down 4 percent.     \n \nEarnings per share this year are anticipated to rise between $6.85 and $7.05, in the range forecast by analysts.   \n \nStanley Black & Decker shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 71 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $125 in Thursday morning trading following the financial report. \n \n\u201cAs we look ahead, we are expecting another strong year in 2017,\u201d said President and CEO James M. Loree. \u201cCertainly, there are significant challenges from a currency and geopolitical perspective, but we are confident in our ability to manage through these uncertainties and focus on solid execution.\u201d \n \nStanley Black & Decker wrapped up 2016 with word it was selling most of its mechanical security businesses to dormakaba for $725 million. The sale, which included the commercial hardware brands of BEST Access, phi Precision and GMT, came at the end of an industrious year for the city manufacturer. \n \nIn August, Stanley confirmed it was relocating 200 white collar jobs from Myrtle Street to its world headquarters complex on Stanley Drive and an office building in Southington. \n \nEmployees were scheduled to move from the five-story, 125,000-square-foot office complex at 480 Myrtle St. to a renovated building on the headquarters campus. An additional subset of workers associated primarily with the hand tools division transferred to an office building on West Street in Southington. \n \nThree months later, the company said it was set to acquire the tool division of Atlanta-based Newell Brands Inc. for $1.95 billion. The unit includes the industrial cutting, hand tool and power tool accessory brands Irwin and Lenox. \n \nStanley Black & Decker is the world\u2019s leading provider of tools and storage. The origins of the company in New Britain date to 1857.

This is the Bible. \nMany of us own this remarkable book but we only read a few pages of it. \n \n\nWe forget that this Book is our passport to being considered worthy of being accepted in God\u2019s heavenly kingdom. \nIf you happen to read many prophecies of the Bible, do you happen to read Matthew \u2018saccount of Christ\u2019s Olivet prophecy  in Chapter 24 verse 6, about the unprecedented preaching of God\u2019s Word as one of the signs that we are now in the very last stages of earth\u2019s calendar? \n \n\nLet us read Matthew\u2019s account: \n\u201dAnd this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\u201d \nTake note of the words \u2018as a testimony\u2019.These really caught my eye. \n \n\nOne does not need not to be a rocket scientist to discern that whether we choose to ignore it or not, the magnitude of the preaching of God\u2019s Word in the whole world has reached such overwhelming and glorious levels. \nThis is testimony to both believers and non-believers alike, that something is brewing in the air and that many of us, by deliberately ignoring the preaching of the Word on radio, television, churches, in the streets, through the internet, in many crusades, revivals - you name it, when we stand before the judgement seat of God, no one will have any excuse that the Word was not preached to him or her. \n \n\nRevelation 14 verse 6 reveals further testimony and a very sombre warning about an angel flying in the air, proclaiming these chilling words: \n\u201cThen I saw another angel flying in midair and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on earth \u2013 to every nation, tribe, language and people.\u201d \nThe eternal Word of God is not limited to being preached in Swaziland only but in every nook and cranny of the world and in many languages. \nIt is available in some places at a nominal fee, at times free and to all those who thirst for spiritual truths \u2013 at no cost! \n \n\nSadly, we choose to ignore it and leave our bibles in our room dividers or cupboards to gather dust without bothering to page through. \nWe ignore the fact that time is running out fast for many of us and we lose sight of the fact that our appointment with eternity is just on the horizon. \n \n\nWhy do many of us choose to ignore such valuable wisdom? I have no doubt that the hand of Satan is playing a very major role in many minds, influencing us to disregard God\u2019s Word and view it as boring and a waste of time. \nSatan is very adept at blinding many minds because he is, since his fall from Eden, very intent on preventing us from seeing the light of the gospel, which has the propensity to change our lives and enable us to be spiritually linked to the heavenly kingdom. \nRemember that he was cast out from heaven, in the process taking with him a third of the angels because of pride, as a result of his malicious intent of wanting to be like the Most High God. \n\nAlex Lucky Nxumalo \nMANZINI","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"OUR PASSPORT TO HEAVEN","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"SZ","country":"Swaziland"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Times of Swaziland","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169676368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Times of Swaziland","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.times.co.sz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201174038","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You might remember the story of Moses and that of Jesus\u2019 birth. However, for now, let us forget spiritualising this matter. \n \n\nLet us look into the economic aspect of it. I would like to believe that controlling how people reproduce is smarter and proactive than the evil alternative of human harvesting. \nAs wrong as that may sound, it could be possible and it is. \nIt has been done previously in other places, when populations become too much. Wars are just one form of human harvesting. \nThe Holocaust was another. \n \n\nLooking at the populations of Nigeria, India and China, it may be clear that human beings at some level do need to be controlled. \nThese are the same people who are becoming a nuisance everywhere in the world. I once heard one Nigerian Mafia in Midrand, South Africa joking that wherever they go, they take over; they become a country within a country. \nThat is a bad thing, especially when it starts to affect other countries, causing world and economy discomfort. \n \n\nAs the Masters of Psychology and some rich people in the likes of the Rockefeller family once came up with a \u2018mind control\u2019 method to study and to control human beings did, countries like Swaziland could use the formulation of some birth control policies. It is clear that Swazis are poor people. \n \n\nThe poorer they are, the more children they tend to have, and this should not be a laughing matter nor should it be taken lightly by our politicians just so they use it as a campaigning tool. \nMost of the poor people we see around us are people born in numbers in a poor and struggling background. \n \n\nMost criminals too, are highly likely people who grew up struggling, possibly because they were many at home. Now, people are not like livestock. \nOf course the more livestock there is, the better for everyone, except motorists because one can sell and make money as well as slaughter and get meat. Human beings, the more they are, the worse off we become, especially in a tiny country like this one failing to get rich from what we have. \n \n\nThe more we are, the higher the crime and many barbaric acts surface, as we can see already from the disappearing children. \nOur leaders just do not care. The more the population, the more their victims. \nIt is about time people compete with people of their calibre and beat them fair and square. Our politicians are weak. \nThey take advantage of the poor and less privileged. \n \n\nThey are only like greedy, money-hungry, blood thirsty creatures sucking both the government and general populace dry, while trying to enrich themselves and their families. They use the general public as nothing but their ladders to success. As soon as they are in parliament, they deliberately ignore the same people who voted for them - until the next elections. \nThat is such a lame and annoying strategy. The less said about the killing of innocent souls just to win these elections, the better. That is to show how weak they are. \n \n\nTaking other people\u2019s lives and manipulating their spirits to make them more powerful is actually the exact reason they become poor and irrelevant again, as soon as they leave parliament. They do not know that now, do they? \nThat is why we have to stand up and advocate for change. \nThe kind of change we need is not getting rid of the institution of the monarch. \nWhat we have to lobby for is a change in the way we live and the way we conduct ourselves. \n \n\nWe should lobby for change in our policies and implement more meaningful strategies. China, one of our friends, implemented something called a `One Child Policy\u2019, which was a part of the family planning policy for that country. \nAccording to the Chinese government, 400 million births were prevented, now whether that is true or false, I am saying Swaziland should look into it. \nOur country is too small to go on having children at this rate. \nSuch is what our lousy politicians should be working on. They should also be looking into the economics of the country thereof, not the \u2018pre-school mentality\u2019 of \u2018ayes\u2019 and \u2018nays\u2019 we hear on radio. \n\nFalse Prophet \nBY EMAIL","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Swaziland news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"THE CHANGE WE NEED IN SD","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"SZ","country":"Swaziland"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Times of Swaziland","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169676368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Times of Swaziland","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.times.co.sz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201174241","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
