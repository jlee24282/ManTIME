So when her newborn, Thomas, was placed on her chest after birth on Dec. 8, she started worrying right away. \n \n\u201cHe had lumps and bruises on his head and back. That was the first indication that something was wrong,\u201d she said. \n \nThe next problem was baby Thomas\u2019 platelet count. Platelets are cells in the blood that help with clotting and prevent bleeding. An average count for healthy babies is somewhere around 200,000 . Thomas had just 19. \n \n\u201cThey thought it was a lab error so they did it again and it was 15,\u201d Harner said. \n \nThomas was put on a helicopter and flown from Gritman Medical Center in Moscow, where the Harner family lives, to Sacred Heart Medical Center. Doctors were initially baffled by his blood cells, but eventually came back with a diagnosis on Dec. 19: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He started chemotherapy the next day. \n \nSince birth, Thomas has needed about 30 blood transfusions. He\u2019s received platelets, whole blood and plasma to help replenish his supplies after chemo and get his counts back up to where they should be. \n \nHarner has donated blood in the past, but said she\u2019s always assumed it went to trauma patients who were in accidents. Now, she\u2019s working with the Inland Northwest Blood Center to put on a blood drive in honor of her son, who\u2019s still fighting for his life. \n \n\u201cI never realized what blood drives went to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s for cancer patients. It\u2019s for the kid next door.\u201d \n \nThe INBC drive will run Feb. 5-11 at its fixed locations in Spokane and Pullman, as well as a bus that travels to Moscow once a week. Tesia Hummer, a spokeswoman for INBC, said the goal is to replenish the blood Thomas has needed and make sure blood is available for other cancer patients. \n \nAbout 30 percent of INBC\u2019s blood supply goes to cancer patients, and another 15 percent to heart patients, she said. \n \nEspecially for patients receiving multiple transfusions, matching with a blood donor is about more than blood type. People may have antibodies that react to another person\u2019s blood, even if the type is the same. More blood available means a greater chance a donor will be a good match for Thomas, which minimizes the risk of a reaction to the transfusion. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s still always blood, it\u2019s just a matter of how great of a match it is,\u201d Hummer said. \n \nPlatelet donors are especially helpful because they can supply enough for several cancer patients with just one donation. Depending on a donor\u2019s platelet count, they may be able to donate as frequently as once a week, far more often than they\u2019d be able to donate blood. \n \nBaby Thomas is currently in the pediatric oncology ward at Sacred Heart Children\u2019s Hospital. His immune system is nearly nonexistent, so only his parents and medical staff are allowed in the room with him. Harner has spent every night with her son in the hospital, and her husband, Arch, alternates between taking care of their other children in Moscow and visiting the hospital. \n \nHarner said they named Thomas for his dad\u2019s grandfather. When he\u2019s older, they\u2019ll pick a verse from the Book of Thomas to decorate his room with, something the Harners do for all their children. \n \nSpending the first months of her son\u2019s life in the hospital wasn\u2019t what Harner expected. When Thomas was first taken to the intensive care unit after birth, she and her husband thought that might be the end of their son\u2019s life. \n \n\u201cNone of it seems real,\u201d she said. \n \nBut Thomas has shown encouraging signs. His bone marrow tests have shown the cancer isn\u2019t spreading, and she\u2019s hopeful he\u2019ll be in remission soon after his initial chemo is complete. \n \nThomas\u2019 first big smile was at one of his doctors, Harner said. He\u2019s never stopped fighting and protests loudly when nurses try to take his blood pressure. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a fighter. I think he\u2019s got a great shot at beating this,\u201d Harner said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rachel Alexander"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Blood donations important in newborn\u2019s fight against cancer at Sacred Heart in Spokane - Sun, 29 Jan 2017 PST","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spokane","zipCode":"99201","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spokane","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spokesman-Review.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685632","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4935"},"name":"Spokesman-Review.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://spokesmanreview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v29/n2/fig_tab/jp2008141f1.html#figure-title"],"sequenceId":"695203240847","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.spokesman.com/photos/2017/01/27/SRX_CATHERINE_THOMAS_HARNER_t75x75_fsharpen.jpg?c089dee51a6323bd6b38604bb2cb9f7270a1e6f9"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"I973hits.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"498055530","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"I973hits.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.i973hits.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203242947","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It has given a temporary gig to Sen. Doug Ericksen of Ferndale as the transition spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, and flat out hired away Sen. Brian Dansel, of Republic, to be assisting specially at the Department of Agriculture. \n \nThis creates a messaging problem for Republicans, because the GOP-led Majority Coalition Caucus is in danger of violating truth-in-advertising standards because their majority is in doubt. But it\u2019s a math problem for Democrats. \n \nWhen the session dawned three weeks ago, that coalition held a 25-24 edge over the Democrats. With Dansel gone and Ericksen encamped in Washington, D.C., the numbers for any kind of controversial legislative action are 23-24. \n \nThere was a running debate all week whether the Senate was tied or had a majority of one party or the other. \n \nRepublican officials in Northeast Washington, Dansel\u2019s old district, are expected to bring that number up one as early as Monday. That, by itself, won\u2019t give them back control because the number for passing anything in the Senate is 25. \n \nThe Senate has a provision that allows the lieutenant governor to vote to break a tie, and that would seem to favor the Democrats because Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib is a Democrat who came from the Senate ranks. But in order for Habib to vote, there must be a 24-24 tie, and should the prospect of that loom, a single Republican need only be absent from the the hallowed chamber, and voila, it is 24-23. \n \nSo unless at least one Republican will vote with Democrats on something near and dear to a deep blue heart, or two Democrats will vote with Republicans on a ruby red issue, ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 controversial moving out of the Senate any time soon. The penalty for that is a deeply held secret by both parties, but inside sources say it involves being strung up by one\u2019s thumbs and forced to listen to a debate between the proponents of Lean management and disciples of efficiency guru Malcolm Baldridge. \n \nMath lessons forced an interminably long day Friday, which was scheduled to be a \u201cpro forma\u201d session. That\u2019s a fancy term for a legislative quickie, where nothing important happens and no more than one person need show up. Most pro forma sessions start and end within about five minutes. \n \nBut on Friday, all 24 Democrats showed up on their half of the Senate floor, with a lone Republican, Floor Leader Joe Fain, of Auburn, on the other. Rather than doing mostly nothing, Democrats wanted to push a bill to the floor that would give the state\u2019s school districts a one-year reprieve from an impending reduction in their taxing authority. This \u201clevy cliff\u201d delay had passed the House earlier in the week and Democrats said school districts need it signed, sealed and delivered right away to avoid having to figure out two budgets \u2013 one with the current money they\u2019re getting, and one without. \n \nSen. Andy Billig, D-Spokane, said for Spokane Public Schools that amounts to a difference of $10.8 million in the budget, which means two significantly different budgets with the smaller one requiring pink slips to teachers. \n \nFain objected to doing anything but adjourning after a few routine procedures. \u201cThere are no votes in a pro forma session.\u201d \n \nDemocrats then offered a motion to change the rules and make it not a pro forma session. That\u2019s not the way the system works, Fain argued, and is messing with tradition and pushing the Senate to the edge of a cliff. (Note: This is a hyperbolic cliff, unlike the levy cliff, which is merely a figurative financial structure.) \n \nAllowing a change like that would mean that some late night, when he was sitting in the chamber to allow routine matters to be formalized he could change rules as a majority of one, Fain said. \n \n\u201cI could make a rule that all the business of the Senate be conducted in sweat pants,\u201d he said. This did not instill any horror on the part of Democrats, who continued to push for a vote. \n \nHabib, facing his first parliamentary challenge, called a recess to study precedent. \n \nSen. Marko Liias, of Lynnwood, admitted to reporters Democrats were trying to leverage their numbers: \u201cWe can\u2019t be in pro forma every day Ericksen\u2019s in D.C.\u201d \n \nFor several hours, Habib researched and senators negotiated. By mid afternoon, Habib announced that the kind of motion Democrats wanted would take 25 votes, not just a majority of the senators present. As they were mounting another parliamentary attack, Fain noticed one Democrat was missing, bringing the headcount down to 24. There must be at least 25 to conduct any business, and when senators had to stand up and be counted, Habib ruled there wasn\u2019t a quorum, forcing an adjournment. \n \nDemocrats claimed a symbolic victory, contending the daylong parliamentary battle highlighted the importance of addressing the levy cliff, and suggested Republicans released their big school improvement plan because of the threat of their maneuvers. \n \nThat may be true, but the real lesson of the day is that to succeed, Democrats will need to work on their addition skills, because Republicans can rely on subtraction. \n \nSpin Control, a weekly column by Olympia reporter Jim Camden, also appears online with daily items at  www.spokesman.com/blogs/spincontrol  .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jim Camden"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Spin Control: Spin Control: Success in the Washington Senate requires counting to 25 - Sun, 29 Jan 2017 PST","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spokane","zipCode":"99201","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spokane","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spokesman-Review.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685632","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4935"},"name":"Spokesman-Review.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://spokesmanreview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203243266","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Inter Milan coach Stefano Piolo warned Serie A his team was yet to peak after it beat bottom club Pescara 3-0 for its ninth successive victory in all competitions on Saturday.\n\nDanilo D\u2019Ambrosio, Joao Mario, and Eder scored for Inter to jump above Lazio and into fourth place, two points below Napoli and three below Roma. Napoli hosts Palermo on Sunday, a few hours after Roma plays at Sampdoria.\n\nLeague-leading Juventus, which visits Sassuolo, is a point above Roma.\n\nInter visits Juventus next weekend, after the Italian Cup quarterfinal at home to Lazio on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMany players are giving a lot but they can still do even more: We haven\u2019t got to our peak,\u201d Pioli said.\n\n\u201cWe know that the game against Juventus will be important for our position in the league, but first there\u2019s the Italian Cup \u2026 against a great team like Lazio, in a competition we really care about. Our focus has to be entirely on the next match, then we will think about Juve.\u201d\n\nInter dominated but had to survive an early scare before taking the lead in the 23rd minute.\n\nGrigoris Kastanos, who is on loan from Juventus, almost scored on his Serie A debut but Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic parried the teenager\u2019s effort. Valerio Verre fired in the rebound but it was ruled out for offside.\n\nMoments later, Albano Bizzarri tipped Joao Mario\u2019s angled drive around his right post and the resulting corner was taken short, allowing Marcelo Brozovic to whip in a cross which was volleyed into the bottom right corner by D\u2019Ambrosio from close range.\n\nInter doubled its lead two minutes before the break in a move started and finished by Joao Mario, who prodded in Ivan Perisic\u2019s low cross.\n\nInter sealed the match in the 73rd although Icardi looked offside when he ran onto Brozovic\u2019s through ball and pulled back for substitute Eder to side-foot home.\n\nLAZIO 0, CHIEVO VERONA 1\n\nLazio\u2019s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League took a blow as it conceded a last-gasp goal at home to Chievo Verona, whose goalkeeper Stefano Sorrentino was in imperious form.\n\nSorrentino denied Marco Parolo on numerous occasions, as well as Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Lucas Biglia.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s football, it\u2019s cruel,\u201d Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi said. \u201cWe had 15 chances and if you don\u2019t score then invariably you concede in the 90th, with their first chance.\u201d\n\nLazio also missed suspended striker Ciro Immobile, who netted three goals in his last four matches.\n\nJust as it appeared as though the match was heading for a goalless draw, Chievo counterattacked and Massimo Gobbi pulled back from the byline for Roberto Inglese to fire home in the 90th minute.\n\nLazio slipped to fifth, two points behind Inter and four below third-placed Napoli.\n\nThere was an ugly incident at the end of the match as Biglia had to be held back by Lazio staff after being verbally abused and spat at by a Lazio fan. Teammate Mamadou Tounkara was in the stands and also had to be held back as he appeared to try to punch the supporter.\n\nBiglia\u2019s wife was in the same sector.\n\n\u201cThere was a squabble, everyone is entitled to their own opinion,\u201d Parolo said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can say anything about tonight, and even less to someone like Biglia, who apart from being our captain, is someone who always gives his all. We are with him.\u201d\n\nThe police were investigating but the club was unlikely to take any action against Biglia.\n\n\u201cBiglia is our captain, he is an exceptional lad, with outstanding skills,\u201d Lazio club manager Angelo Peruzzi said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that some so-called fan attacked him. That shouldn\u2019t happen at all \u2026 Biglia is our captain, he will remain our captain, because all the squad follows him.\u201d\n\nTounkara apologized on social media.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Serie A news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Inter Milan beat Pescara 3-0 to rise to fourth in Serie A","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203244666","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:59Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Captain Scott Curry restored the host's lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. \n \nBut another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \nHaving won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn't particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. \n \nKoroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. \n \nTalent of the sort that made Manawatu's Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. \n \n\"He's probably better than me,\" Cama said of Koroi. \n  \nThe teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. \n \n\"This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he's been playing for a few years now. There's always things to work on and hopefully he's going to kick on from now,\" said Cama. \n \n\"When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that's when they look forward and make decisions.\" \n \nIt's Koroi's composure that really excites Cama. \n \n\"At this stage I don't have to do a lot. He's got all the talent. If anything it's just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best.\" \n \nKoroi can't quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. \n \n\"I've been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous,\" Koroi said. \n \nIt's just that he hasn't played like a nervous bloke. \n \n\"Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you're a playmaker.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Zealand end Wellington Sevens with defeat to Argentina","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Taranaki Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Taranaki Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203246113","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  \n \nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n \nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their dominant win in Wellington.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sydney or the bush for NZ","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Taranaki Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Taranaki Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203247875","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's great that we are again in a moment like this.\" \n \nAs Nadal and Federer arrived at Melbourne Park as ninth and 17th seeds, therefore, the first drafts of the obituaries of two great sporting careers were being prepared. \n \nThey were hurriedly dropped back into the files, however, as it became apparent the duo were playing vintage tennis: Federer all fluidity and peerless shot-making, Nadal at his brutal best from the baseline. \n \nThe early departures of reigning champion Novak Djokovic and top seed Andy Murray, the players who had joined Federer and Nadal to make up the \"Big Four\", then opened up the path to a grand final reunion. \n \nAlthough it has often felt more like 2007 than 2017 at Melbourne Park this week, even great champions are not immune to the ravages of time. \n \nRecovery Time \n \nAt 35, Swiss Federer is the oldest men's grand slam finalist since Ken Rosewall lost the U.S. Open final in 1974 at the age of 39. \n \nNadal might be five years younger but has been on tour since his late teens and the effort required for his attritional playing style puts tremendous strain on his body. \n \nAnd while Federer has been able to rest up after his three-hour semi-final victory over Stan Wawrinka on Thursday, Nadal must recuperate as best he can after his epic five-hour victory over Grigor Dimitrov on Friday. \n \n\"That's what I'm going to try,\" the 14-times grand slam champion said. \"I did it in 2009. I am seven, eight years older.\" \n \nThat five-set 2009 victory over Federer earned Nadal his sole Australian Open crown and another would make him the only man in the open era apart from Roy Emerson to have won all four grand slams twice. \n \nFederer has four Australian Open titles but just a single French Open crown, his path to Roland Garros glory more often than not blocked by Nadal. \n \nImmediately after his semi-final, as he was finally able to ponder meeting his great rival, the 17-times grand slam champion suggested his 11-23 record against Nadal might have been in part due to them meeting on clay so often early in their careers. \n \nAfterwards, in his news conference, he was less candid, noting only that the pace of the Rod Laver Arena this year allowed him to be more aggressive. \n \n\"Now it's a different time,\" he said. \"A lot of time has gone by. I know this court allows me to play a certain game against Rafa that I cannot do on centre court at the French Open.\" \n \nNadal has a 6-2 edge over Federer in grand slam finals but few are making a call with any confidence over who will win Sunday's contest. \n \n\"I just know that two of the greatest players of tennis are going to square off on Sunday, and it's going to be a freakin' amazing match,\" Dimitrov said on Friday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Rafael Nadal to meet Roger Federer in epic Australian Open final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203250258","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He led Bloomfield with 22 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists. \n \nBy Andrew Bowen \n  \nBLOOMFIELD -- The Cardinals never trailed as they started a new kind of winning streak. \n \nBloomfield (8-9) led from the opening jump to the final horn in a 59-43 victory over Brown County, the Cardinals second straight win on a night that also witnessed the crowning of the Homecoming Court and a celebration of the feats of basketball teams from years ending in seven. It marked Bloomfield\u2019s second straight win after losing six straight. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our kids,\u201d Bloomfield coach Jaime Hudson said. \u201cThey could have easily folded. They kept their heads up. They came to work.\u201d \n \nA.J. Sipes drives past David Norman of Brown County to attempt a layup. \n \nBy Andrew Bowen \n  \nSenior guard Chris Gilmore nearly had a triple double as he led Bloomfield with 22 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists. He said he feels fully recovered from a fractured fibia that caused him to miss several games during the losing streak. \u201cWe really struggled with Gilmore,\u201d said Brown County coach Chuck Hutchins. Hudson said he had a \u201cphenomenal game.\u201d \n \n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m back 100 percent,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt any pain since Christmas. I feel pretty great.\u201d \n \nHis companions in mayhem against the Eagles defense were Isaac Combs who scored 14 points and Turner Royall who nailed three treys on the baseline as he scored all his 11 points in the fourth quarter. Combs grabbed nine rebounds as he almost had a double-double. Gilmore said they are the reason he almost got 10 assists. \n \nTurner Royal looks to pass the ball in the first quarter. He lit up the fourth, sinking three three's and scoring 11 points. \n \nBy Andrew Bowen \n  \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give them credit because they hit the shots,\u201d he said. \n \nHudson said the Cardinals are starting to be more unselfish with the orange sphere. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the (way) we\u2019re sharing the basketball the last two games,\u201d he said. \n \nIsaac Combs puts up a bucket to score two of his 14 points. \n \nBy Andrew Bowen \n  \nThe Cardinals had a ratio of 12 assists to 12 turnovers, but Hudson said he wasn\u2019t overly worried. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing the ball a lot better. Turnovers are going to happen. As last we\u2019re going to the basket and I can handle that.\u201d \n \nGilmore said Friday\u2019s game, in which Bloomfield humbled North Central 83-19, taught the Cardinals the importance of seeing the floor and moving the ball around. He said Friday\u2019s triumph \u201creally opened our eyes. \n \n\u201cTonight it seemed a lot easier to get the guys the ball,\u201d he said. \n \nHudson praised Bloomfield\u2019s defense for holding the Eagles to 16-48 (33.3 percent) from the field and 43 points for the game. He said the Cardinals almost achieved their goal of limiting the Eagles to only 40 points. Gilmore and Combs also led the Bloomfield defense as they both swiped the ball twice and Gilmore blocked two shots. \n \nHunter First drilled four treys as he was the only Eagle to hit double figures. \n \n\u201cI was really pleased with our defense,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThe last two games I\u2019ve been really pleased with the way our kids are playing defensively.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d Hutchins said as his club fell to 3-12. \u201cThey were able to score around the basket. Inside the first half they were able to get inside our zone.\u201d \n \nHe said the Eagles missed Josh Cochran, their leading scorer and rebounder, a 6-foot-10 senior who had to go to Florida to attend a family funeral. However, Hutchins said Bloomfield is a much better team than their six-game losing streak would indicate. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a good team,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot better than their record would suggest.\u201d \n \nGilmore made his presence felt immediately, dishing to Ethan Fitch and Combs for buckets and going up between two defenders for a layup to spur Bloomfield to an 8-0 lead. Isaiah Keefauver buried a trey to put Brown County on the board, but the visitors would score only one more point in the first quarter. Luke Vandeventer sank both his three-pointers and Gilmore put up another layup and Bloomfield had a 16-4 lead after one quarter. \n \nA.J. Sipes sank a seven-foot bank shot and an 18-footer to give the Cardinals a 19-9 lead in the second frame. First began popping treys, but the Eagles would never get closer than 24-16. Gilmore answered with a traditional three-point play. \n \nThat continued for the rest of the game as Bloomfield answered every Eagle attempt at a run. A trey to open the third and Gilmore converts another antique three-point play and Vandeventer feeds Combs for a bucket. First bangs a trey to cut the margin to 36-26 with 2:56 left in the third quarter and Gilmore responds with a short jumper, two foul shots, and an assist. First ends the third with a trey to make the score 42-30 and Royal takes possession of the baseline in the fourth, earning praise from Hutchins for going 4-6 from the field. \n \nBloomfield also posted a romp in the junior varsity game, beating Brown County 53-26 after jumping out to a 17-4 lead. \n \nScorers were: Luke Oliphant, 17; Graysen Medina and Andrew Shelton, eight; Patrick Beard, seven; Ethan Fitch, five; Dylan Richardson, four; Tythan Turpin and Kyler Hudson, two apiece. \n \nThe Cards next play at 7:30 p.m. Thursday when they host North Daviess in their final Southwestern Indiana Athletic Conference game. Hudson said Saturday\u2019s victory will be good preparation for the remainder of the seasoned and the sectional. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re treating this as a nine-game season,\u201d Hudson said of the games after the losing streak. \u201cWe have nine games left and he have to win seven to go 9-0.\u201d \n \nBrown Co. 4 12 14 13 -- 43 \n \nBloomfield 16 13 13 17 -- 59 \n \nBROWN COUNTY (43) \n \nHeminger 0-0 0-0 0, Samples 0-8 0-0 0, Patterson 2-4 1-3 5, Keefauver 2-7 1-2 6 4F, Matlock 0-0 0-0 0, Carter 1-1 0-0 3, Norman 3-5 0-0 6, Scully 3-11 0-0 8 3F, Kegley 0-1 0-0 0, Hudson 1-3 0-1 2 2F, McPheeters 0-0 0-0 0, First 4-8 1-2 13, TEAM 16-48 .333 3-8 .375 9F.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 50 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kansas City Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1100"},"name":"Kansas City Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Environment"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmbc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203252566","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This year\u2019s section dealt with some of the most contentious international issues of our times.\u201dCity of Ghosts,\u201d Matthew Heineman\u2019s powerful followup to the Oscar-nominated \u201cCartel Land,\u201d deals with the courageous investigative journalists of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, who have risked their lives to smuggle out footage of the war crimes being committed on Syrians by ISIS. Jeff Orlowski\u2019s \u201cChasing Coral\u201d exposed the impact of climate change on coral reefs, while \u201cICARUS\u201d tackled Russia\u2019s doping scandal.\u201cQuest,\u201d the understated vérité effort from Jonathan Olshefski, was especially relevant. The film follows an African American family in Philadelphia over the course of a decade. Starting with the election of Barack Obama in 2008, \u201cQuest\u201d climaxes with the arrival of Donald Trump. As the family watches Trump on television, asking black audiences \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d, one member of the household sighs. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how we live,\u201d she says.That fundamental disconnect between powerful leaders and a struggling citizenry wasn\u2019t at the forefront of the films that won the grand jury prizes,[1] but it percolated beneath their surfaces. The Sundance awards, which took place in the midst of nationwide protests against a Trump-approved ban on Muslim countries, ultimately focused more on powerful attitudes than ways in which they might be applied to the current political climate.In \u201cDina[2],\u201d the moving sophomore effort from Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini, the directors follow the quiet life of 48-year-old Dina Buno, a woman who has Asberger\u2019s Syndrome and attempts to rediscover romance after a traumatic experience in her developing relationship with a man named Scott, who has intimacy issues of his own. \u201cWhile it does raises a number of uncomfortable questions regarding the lens through which the \u2018neurotypical\u2019 world looks at people on the spectrum, \u2018Dina\u2019 confronts such delicate topics head-on, wrestling with those bugs until they become features ,\u201d wrote IndieWire\u2019s David Ehrlich[3] in his review.Perhaps just as notably, the movie presents an apolitical view of the world that\u2019s attuned to the value of a balanced society open to a range of personalities and backgrounds. While Dina\u2019s problems ostracize her from the world at large, she finds a way forward in a community steeped in kindness and acceptance. It\u2019s a timeless sentiment, but one that stands as particularly constructive at a moment when the cultural landscape is more fragmented than ever before.\u201cDina\u201d hints at a subtle form of feminist resistance distinguishable from the marches that stretched across the country on Sundance\u2019s first weekend. In the one scene in which Dina and Scott acknowledge the political climate, Dina says she hopes Hillary Clinton will win the presidency. \u201cI\u2019m not really into politics at all,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s a woman\u2019s world now, and Hillary Clinton should be a good candidate.\u201dIf only. But there\u2019s something refreshingly personal about the rousing emotions stirred up by \u201cDina,\u201d a movie that has less to do with who leads the country than with the resilience of the people stuck within its confines.NetflixA similar kind of personal rebellion exists at the center of \u201cI don\u2019t feel at home in this world anymore.\u201d, the directorial debut of actor Macon Blair . Blair\u2019s stylish black comedy features a playfully anarchic turn by Melanie Lynskey as Ruth, a lonely single woman dealing with the fallout after her house gets robbed. Joining forces with her eccentric neighbor , she launches a comically violent path to recover her missing possessions that finds her unexpectedly at the center of an ill-conceived robbery.Blair populates his outrageous farce with idiosyncratic characters who act as though they\u2019re the stars of their own heroic epics. The two-bit criminals who face down with Lynskey and Wood wouldn\u2019t seem out of place in a \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d vignette, and yet Ruth\u2019s own sense of determination to correct her rather unremarkable situation by getting her stuff back imbues the movie with an underlying sense of purpose. As Ehrlich wrote in his review[4]: \u201cOne look between these platonic avengers \u2014 their friendship forged by frustration \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that while the world may be fucked, it\u2019s ours to make of it what we will.\u201dWhen she finally faces down with one of the goons responsible for her situation, he asks her what she hopes to get out of the confrontation, and she\u2019s at a loss for words. It\u2019s a telling moment: How do you explain to a morally bankrupt person that they\u2019re in the wrong? Their exchange is at once hilarious and, as an allegory for the lack of interest in ethical guidelines afflicting the American government at the moment, essentially tragic.Both movies position the problems of our times on a human level often absent from the cluttered media landscape. Neither Dina nor Ruth excel at verbalizing their problems, but they take decisive action to fix them.Sometimes, words are not enough. These Sundance winners present an alternative in people taking action to improve their immediate surroundings. They focus on the commitments of underprivileged Americans to keep living their lives, pushing beyond their immediate boundaries to find some modicum of hope.

Selznick Award, voted on by members as the best-produced movie of the year, often proceeds to win the Best Picture Oscar. The producers are more likely to laud a movie with ambitious scale and scope. So Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d was favored to win, and sure enough, producers Fred Berger, Jordan Horowitz and Marc Platt accepted the prize.\u201cLa La Land\u201d was introduced by John Legend, who debated coming to the event but made a contribution to the ACLU and echoed many political statements made during the course of the night when he said: \u201cWe are the voice, we are the face of America; it is big and free and open to the dreamers of all races and countries and religions.\u201d\u201cDamien Chazelle has made a story about the sacrifices artists make,\u201d said producer Platt. \u201cWe celebrate all the fools who struggle but passionately try to achieve our artistic dreams.\u201d He praised \u201cthe power of cinema fueled by free artistic expression that cannot be denied and has no borders and will never be banned from our hearts, our minds, and our souls. Now we must believe that love can change our lives as it has changed the world.\u201dLast year PGA[2]-winner \u201cThe Big Short\u201d did not line up with the Oscar, as small-scale \u201cSpotlight\u201d took that win, but the year before that \u201cBirdman\u201d won both, and before that \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d tied, with Alfonso Cuaron winning the Best Director Oscar while \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d nabbed Best Picture.ESPNAlso favored to win both the PGA and Oscar was Disney\u2019s animated feature \u201cZootopia,\u201d which took home the PGA Award. And winning best documentary was Ezra Edelman and Caroline Waterlow\u2019s  \u201cO.J.: Made in America\u201d , which is expected to repeat on Oscar night. \u201cOne of the goals of the film was to put back some of the historical context in the telling of this story,\u201d said Wadlow. Edelman thanked ESPN for getting the independence and freedom to make the film: \u201cWe are threatening to build walls and close borders, and I am standing here as a direct descendant of the \u2018Loving v. Virginia\u2019 decision,\u201d he said, also citing \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cArrival\u201d as films of inclusion. \u201cPlease keep telling stories about humanity, about our country, about a world we want to live in.\u201dThe fictional FX series \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d also took home the David L. Wolper long-form television award. The Norman Felton Award for Episodic Television Drama went to Series 1 of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d which beat favorite \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d PGA-nominated \u201cArrival\u201d producer Shawn Levy accepted the award, thanking his \u201cninja ace\u201d Dan Cohen for discovering the Duffer brothers.The Danny Thomas Award for Episodic Television Comedy went to Season 1 of \u201cAtlanta,\u201d which also won at the Golden Globes. The Non-Fiction Television Award went to producers Laura Ricciardi and Noira Demos for Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaking A Murderer,\u201d who thanked Lisa Nishimura for helping them to get the series made after 10 years. \u201cIf there\u2019s a story you think needs to be told, stick with it,\u201d said Laura Ricciardi.\u201cThe Voice\u201d took home the Competition Television award, accepted by Mark Burnett. Live Entertainment and Talk went to \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver.\u201dFull list of awards here.[3]Working the Beverly Hilton ballroom at the PGA Awards were Oscar nominees Damien Chazelle, Matt Damon, Denis Villeneuve, Pharrell Williams, Barry Jenkins, Mahershala Ali, Justin Timberlake, Jeff Bridges, and Nicole Kidman as well as future Emmy contenders Julia Louis-Dreyfus, James Corden, Taraji P. Henson, Ryan Murphy, Rami Malek, Sarah Paulson, Thandie Newton, and Kerry Washington.During the awards show, the Producers Guild also awarded James L. Brooks with the Norman Lear Achievement Award in Television. Brooks made a persuasive argument for how television rewards bravery. Producer Meg Ellison accepted the Visionary Award from Kathryn Bigelow, committing to tell more strong stories going forward.Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman accepted the Milestone Award, presented by Hugh Jackman, who praised him for telling him to \u201cstep up\u201d on the set of \u201cX-Men,\u201d as well as his two pink-hat wearing daughters. \u201cLet\u2019s fight for originality,\u201d said Rothman. \u201cIntegrity is what counts.\u201d His clip reel reminds what great risks Rothman took at Fox on such films as \u201cMaster and Commander\u201d and \u201cRomeo + Juliet.\u201d Let\u2019s hope he finds his stride at Sony and steps up.Producer Irwin Winkler won the David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures, presented by genial collaborators Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese, who made five pictures with him. Jeff Nichols\u2019 biracial romance \u201cLoving\u201d won the Stanley Kramer Award.

The ceremony opened at 7:00PM MT, featuring host Jessica Williams shepherding along the festivities in predictably amusing fashion.Macon Blair\u2019s playful suspense film \u201cI don\u2019t feel at home in this world anymore.\u201d won the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize, while the U.S. Documentary Grand Jury Prize went to \u201cDina.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel at home in the world anymore.\u201d marks the directorial debut of Blair, previously best known for his acting collaborations with director Jeremy Saulnier . The movie stars Melanie Lynskey as a woman who embarks on a darkly comic adventure as she seeks out the identity of the person who robbed her apartment, joining forces with her eccentric neighbor .\u201cDina\u201d is the sophomore effort from \u201cMala Mala\u201d directors Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles, who focus on the life of Dina Bruno, a woman afflicted with Asperberg\u2019s Syndrome who finds an ideal romantic companion with her financé, Scott.In her opening speech, Sundance Institute Executive Director Keri Putnam addressed the current political state of the country with a series of well-received remarks that culminated with one major takeaway aimed at both artists and fans: \u201cWe stand with you and all people risking their lives for their values or seeking refuge.\u201dMany of the speeches delivered over the course of the evening acknowledged the divisive political situation across the country.In his acceptance speech, Blair noted that his parents attended the recent Women\u2019s March on Washington, while a similar march[2] took place at Sundance. \u201cThose things were really hopeful for me,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThey made me feel really good in the face of all this craven, regressive bullshit going on.\u201dActor Gael Garcia Bernal, a member of the U.S. Dramatic Jury, alluded to the current international tensions with the Trump Administration. \u201cToday, especially, I\u2019m from Iraq, from Iran, from Syria, I\u2019m from many other countries as well,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so obvious that we\u2019re so interdependent, so interconnected with everything we do. We think about each other\u2026I invite you on behalf of everyone from Mexico, to come to Mexico.\u201dComedian Larry Wilmore, a member of the U.S. Documentary jury, sounded a similar note of solidarity. \u201cEven though I grew up Catholic, today I am a Muslim, Wilmore said, then joked: \u201cTomorrow, I have to go to the airport, so I\u2019ll be Catholic again.\u201dPraising \u201cDina,\u201d Wilmore added, \u201cAny time when our world seems to be getting darker and more dangerous, this film dares to be simply more beautiful.\u201dFellow juror and documentary filmmaker Robert Greene also hit a topical note. \u201cI texted a few Muslim filmmakers we all know and said, \u2018I\u2019m thinking about you,'\u201d he said. \u201cOne them wrote back, \u2018Keep our friend in mind, because he just arrived to JFK and had been detained.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what to do. It feels really strange to be in this kind of room, although this is a great group of people. One thing you can do is keep telling stories, which is what we do.\u201dWinning the U.S. Documentary Special Jury Award For Storytelling, director Yance Ford added, \u201cNeutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes, we must interfere. That moment is now. We must document and prevent our nation from folding in on itself. Each of us must stand together as pillars of fire in the darkness. The time is now. Summon your courage, Gather your cameras. America needs us.\u201dMeanwhile, filmmaker Eliza Hittman acknowledged the challenges facing women in the film industry while accepting her prize for best director for \u201cBeach Rats,\u201d which new distribution company Neon announced it had acquired moments later. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more taboo in this country than a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to work my way through a system that\u2019s completely discriminatory towards women. Hollywood, I\u2019m coming for you.\u201dDocumentarian Jeff Orlowski won the U.S. Documentary Audience Award and acknowledged the film\u2019s alarming perspective on climate change. \u201cCan we have a shoutout for science?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be political because climate change and science shouldn\u2019t be political. We want this film to be a tool to as many audiences out there. If you know anyone out there skeptical of climate change, please show them this film. We don\u2019t want to make these films. It\u2019s something we feel have to do.\u201dREAD MORE: The 2017 IndieWire Sundance Bible: Every Review, Interview and News Item Posted During the Festival[3]Upon winning the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize for the documentary, \u201cLast Men in Aleppo,\u201d the film\u2019s co-director Firas Fayyad took the stage and commented: \u201cWe are Syrian.

Our capacity will also find a 60-70 per cent jump. \n \nThat is a real challenge for the company. To ramp up, produce, and sell. That is the biggest issue for the company,\u201d the chairman said, voicing concerns. \n \nSteel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh recently inaugurated the new Universal Rail Mill (URM) at SAIL\u2019s Bhilai Steel Plant and flagged off the first rake from the new mill, he said. \n \nThe Rs 1,200-crore URM will take BSP\u2019s total capacity to produce rails at 2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), which will be the largest rail production capacity in any single location for a plant the world-over. \n \nElaborating, he said that the company had a production growth of 17 per cent in the last calender year and he expects an output growth of 15-17 per cent this year as well. \n \n\u201cThis extra production, which is coming particularly when the demand is not growing\u2026.There lies the challenge,\u201d he said. \n \nThe production is growing almost 7-8 per cent but demand is growing by 3 per cent, he said adding the per capita consumption, which is at 61 kg, needs a rapid push. \n \n\u201cWe are also driving mass scale campaign where we are meeting various ministries, consumers, various users to increase the steel consumption.

The entire Bollywood is shocked with the entire incident and everyone is supporting the filmmaker and wants strict action to take against the culprits.  Actor Sushant Singh Rajput went to a whole new level to show his support to SLB. The actor removed Rajput from his surname which is a HUGE step and we hope it will be an eye opener. The actor changed his name to Sushant and wrote on twitter, \u201cWe would suffer till the time we\u2019re obsessed with our surnames.

However the filmmaker released an official statement where he claimed there is NO such scene being shot between Ranveer and Deepika. \n \nSanjay Leela Bhansali has shot two films in Jaipur and despite his love for Rajasthan, for the safety of his crew, we have decided to leave the city post the shocking incident where miscreants damaged property and misbehaved with the crew on the shoot of \u2018Padmavati\u2019,\u201d  \u201cSLB had directed the opera \u2018Padmavati\u2019 to packed houses in Paris and earned worldwide praise for it.

We clarify that there is no dream sequence or any objectionable scene between Rani Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji. We have been carefully researching and making the film\u2026 The attack on the shoot and crew was uncalled for and was extremely damaging to the image of the beautiful city of Jaipur,\u201d the statement added. We are confident that Mewar will be proud of the film made on their revered queen.

The experiment showed that dogs continued to prefer familiar partners. \n \nThe researchers from University of Veterinary Medicine in Austria had earlier showed that dogs share food rewards with other dogs. \n \nUsing a bar-pulling task, the dogs delivered the treats to partner dogs \u2013 especially if these were already known to them. \n \nHowever, the increased complexity of the task influenced the readiness with which the dogs delivered a food reward to another animal. \n \nThe new study confirmed that the chosen method affects the result and is much more dependent on social proximity than had previously been assumed. \n \nFor the study, the dogs had to recognise special objects in form of tokens in order to deliver a food reward to the other dog. \n \n\u201cThis time we not only tested a different experimental set-up but also the level of difficulty. The dogs were first trained to touch a token in exchange for a food reward for themselves,\u201d said Rachel Dale from the university. \n \n\u201cThey were then trained to recognise two more tokens: one that resulted in a reward being delivered to a partner dog and another which did not,\u201d Dale said. \n \nThe researchers tested whether it made a difference to the donor dog if the receiver was familiar or a stranger and whether the presence of another dog was enough to trigger generous behaviour in the test dog even if the partner had no access to the food. \n \nThe test set-up consisted of two enclosures. The test dog was trained to wait on a specific location in one enclosure until the researchers revealed a board containing the tokens. \n \nThe dog could then choose to deliver a food reward to the receiver dog or not. In the first test, either a familiar dog or a stranger sat in the receiver enclosure. The dogs could see each other during the experiment. \n \nIn the second test, the receiver enclosure remained empty but the other dog was present in the testing room. \n \nIn a third test, the dogs were alone in the entire set-up. At the end of each test series, the donor animals could reward themselves by being allowed to touch the token that delivered the food reward to them. \n \nThis was done to ensure that the dogs remained motivated and unstressed and did not become distracted by an unfamiliar dog. \n \nThe experiment confirmed that dogs continue to exhibit prosocial behaviour despite the more complex task. \n \nThe dogs clearly showed a preference for sharing the food reward with a familiar dog. \n \nThe study appears in the journal PLOS ONE. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[],"title":"Dogs prefer to share food with friends: study","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203263072","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_03.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico. \n \nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends. \n \nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long. \n \nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports. \n \nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader. \n \nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion. \n \nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups. \n \nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism. \n \n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\" \n \nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said. \n \nThe story Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blacktown Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699273","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blacktown Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blacktownsun.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203265039","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country. \n \nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely. \n \nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa. \n \nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government. \n \nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban. \n \n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said. \n \n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals. \n \n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\" \n \nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination. \n \n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said. \n \n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\" \n \nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. \n \nAn emergency stay issued by a US federal judge has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country. \n \nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments. \n \nThe story Qantas offers refunds to Australians affected by Trump's 'Muslim ban' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Qantas offers refunds to Australians affected by Trump's 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blacktown Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699273","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blacktown Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blacktownsun.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203265517","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lincoln","zipCode":"88345","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ruidoso","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"RuidosoSearch.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169772491","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"35"},"name":"RuidosoSearch.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ruidosonews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/264420536/ruidoso/sports","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/264420536/ruidoso/sports","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/264420536/ruidoso/sports,","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/264420536/ruidoso/sports","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/264420536/ruidoso/sports","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/264420536/ruidoso/sports"],"sequenceId":"695203286363","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

The wide array of recipes and variations make soup a great fit for any diet. Soup is not only for cold weather days. Soups can be enjoyed year-round as there are both hot and cold-served versions. \n \nYou may be surprised to learn that there are many great health benefits you can gain from eating soup. Here are five reasons soup is a healthy option for any meal. \n \n1. SOUP RELIEVES THE COMMON COLD \n \nThere may be no real cure for a cold, but taking certain measures does help to relieve symptoms. Lots of rest and medication are essential, but eating soup can also help. \n \nSoups with broth help you to avoid dehydration \u2014 a common occurrence when sick. When soup is served hot, the steam decongests sinuses. \n \nWarm fluids from soup also break down mucus, commonly associated with illnesses like the cold. \n \n2. SOUP CONTAINS LESS CALORIES \n \nMost soup recipes contain fewer calories than a meal made with meats and side dishes, such as a meal of chicken and rice. Even soups made with less-than-healthy ingredients, such as cream, can be made using a substitute to create low-fat or low-calorie versions. Use Maggi® soup mixes and add food and vegetables to create a filling meal. \n \nEat soup and you will still feel full while consuming fewer calories. \n \n3. FRESH INGREDIENTS EQUAL MORE NUTRITION \n \nAdding fresh vegetables enhances the nutritional content of soup. For those who take meat, this adds a punch of protein. \n \nPutting vegetables in your Maggi® soups make it deliciously easy to get the recommended daily servings in meal. \n \n4. BONE UP ON FLAVOUR AND NUTRITION \n \nUsing bones with Maggi® soup is a great way to add even more nutrients to the dish. When stewed or simmered, bones and marrow release vitamins and minerals that are said to help with a variety of issues \u2014 from digestive health and better joints to shinier hair and reduced inflammation. \n \n5. YOUR WALLET CAN BE HEALTHIER TOO \n \nMaking a main meal of soup is easy on the pocket. Maggi® soups are fantastic to make for the family when you are trying to conserve money. \n \nDried ingredients that you can add to the soup dish like beans and pasta are usually inexpensive, come in larger quantities, and have longer shelf lives \u2014 allowing more use out of one supply. \n \nAdditionally, soups can be prepared ahead of time and frozen for later meals, thus saving money in the future.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Soup up your health","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203290422","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Dr Gono could not be reached for comment as he was said to be out of the country. \n\nKereke said, \"From my heart, I would want to say to Dr Gono it's good to rediscover each other, mukoma. It's good to rediscover each other, mukoma. Rediscovering in the sense that we had gone so far, lost in our own appetite to fight and fight and fight and fight. \n\n\"More like fighting, but both of you are on a cliff. You can almost imagine what would happen. You are on a cliff and you are busy brawling. You may roll over and the results would be casualties beyond yourselves. It affects family, it affects the image of the country. It affects a lot of other things.\" \n\n\"So I withdrew all my cases from the courts and elected that path where parties should really talk over as a way to get an end to this. And also factually, Dr Gono was able to give credible, plausible explanations on a lot of the grey areas that had caused us problems,\" said Kereke who was in high spirits with a huge Bible by his side. Pressed to explain what really went wrong since the two had an \"excellent\" working relationship at the RBZ, Kereke said: \"I think Dr Gono would be the best person to respond to that. You know, when two parts of the same body are attached and you separate them abruptly, there is trauma. \n\nThere is bleeding. The part that has been amputated will remain with questions, but I want to say all of that is in the past now. \n\nAll of that is in the past.\" \n\nKereke explained how the dispute started, saying at one point when he returned to work from his annual leave, he was shocked when he was denied access into the Central Bank. \n\n\"Just so you know, I went on leave; it was in December. In January, when I drove to work, the doors were closed. No discussion, nothing. So, a lot of the issues about what went wrong, I would not be the best person to answer. \n\n\"But I want to insist again, this is now in retrospect. Whatever it was, I want to believe it's finished now. We are now on the same page. We are now people who have found common ground. \n\n\"We have been communicating through lawyers, wanting to clarify areas where we had differences. I want to say that process went on very smoothly and cordially because either side wanted real closure, to get to the bottom of things. So, yes, we communicated through our legal counsels.\" \n\nKereke added: \"But the moment communication was opened, he was able to say 'Ahhh, munin'ina, you know what, these funds whereas from the information you had, the file which you had, this went to Air Zimbabwe, this went to Zec and so on. \n\n\"We reconciled and I said, 'Ahh, mukoma, this is correct.\" \n\n\"So, there is no issue. We were able to tick line by line all these things and cleared all the grey areas. I came to the conclusion that there was perhaps on the part of my brother . . . he ought to have communicated better so that there was proper synchronisation of information.\" \n\nAsked whether he regrets what he did to Dr Gono, Kereke was emphatic in his response. \n\n\"Very much so. In fact, in my statement, I said things could have been managed differently and better perhaps,\" he said. \n\nKereke went on to explain that he was making the apology out of his own volition. \n\n\"Certainly and for the record, no one talked me into this. It is a matter of wanting to clear my own conscience. It is a voluntary process. It is a process, I want to believe also Dr Gono has to move on with his life, so do I. We needed to clear the air. \n\nCertainly, no one talked me into this . . . \n\n\"We had driven each other to the cliff where everything was embarrassing now. We were losing face even to our wives and to our children. So, sense had to come in. We realised this is not good. \n\n\"And for the country, Dr Gono was governor of the Central Bank, appointed by the country's leadership. On my part, I think I needed to have acted differently regardless of whatever he would have done. Whatever he would have done, I should have acted differently. I think in a way, I wasn't sensitive. Without any shame, I tender my apologies to the country and to Dr Gono. \n\nHe went further to exonerate Dr Gono from all the corruption allegations he levelled against him. \n\nAsked whether Dr Gono was corrupt, Kereke responded: \"He is not. This has come about, you know, when you block dialogue, no pressure moves anything unless it's contained. If you boil water, close it in a can, it blows up the thing. There is no movement. \n\n\"I think we didn't share information as much as we have now done. We didn't explain things because there was that sudden amputation. So, the question was: These things that I have, could they be the ones; the reasons I have been shunted out? Or what is it? But through dialogue, you then see that you join the two pieces together and they make a logical story which is quite plausible . . . \n\n\"Dr Gono and I, we were beyond workmates. We were like brothers. I think that's perhaps the reason why the dispute had to go to such extremes. When you go to brothers who are very close, more like your own arm, you wake up one night, zaaappp, it's taken off. There would be trauma. Any small glitch tends to snobble into a bigger dispute. \n\n\"Having said all this, I tendered my apologies to Dr Gono and his family to say, 'Ahhh, mukoma, let's be sensible. Regardless of whatever you had done, muri mukoma, muri mukuru kwandiri. You are my brother. I am sorry for the way I acted.' He accepted the apology. Likewise, he said, 'Munin'ina, whatever went wrong at any stage in our relationship, know that I have forgiven you and we want to live normally.' \n\n\"That's at our level. But to the country, with a very clear conscience, I want to profusely apologise to the country's leadership and the nation at large. To say really this brawl with Dr Gono risked tarnishing the image of the country. It was not good at all. \n\nWe could have acted better and in a different way. \n\n\"I have an example. His Excellency always says, 'Mukanetsana, even at party level, regardless kuti umwe atora dhongi remunhu or mbudzi, try to resolve the issue quietly muri kumacorner.' I think, in a way, Dr Gono and I hatina kuteerera that advice. Fortunately, we have come to realise that it was the right advice.\" \n\nKereke said he was aware that the dispute had affected Dr Gono's businesses and his standing in the eyes of his partners. \n\n\"I have clearly stated in my statement that, 'Don't look at the brother-to-brother dispute that had come up as a reflection of his integrity, as a reflection of his inability to deliver. Please, see that this was a dispute.' \n\n\"People were throwing sling-shots. If you google the speeches he would give, sometimes the jabs he would give, offensive language that also came from me to him. It affects relationships. \n\n\"So, to the business community, honestly and with all sincerity, take it from the fact that the two parties have now reconciled. \n\nThey did all they did in the midst of a conflict which was mishandled by both parties. We are pleased that it is over.\" \n\nKereke explained that he had chosen to speak through Our Harare Correspondent because of its credibility and remarkably high circulation figures. \n\n\"I think it's about credibility. The tragedy with our media these days is that they can turn something which is virtuous into something awfully terrible, depending on which side of the political equation that journalist is. \n\n\"I know certainly that The Sunday Mail has credibility, believability among the public. It's also about circulation because we want people to know that the yesteryear conflict is no more. We have reconciled. We are one family. \n\n\"If Dr Gono were to bring me on a public holiday, we have the forthcoming Easter Holiday, cooked beef in a lunchbox, I would eat it without doubting or suspecting that there could be something in it. He can bring me a cup of coffee. He knows my sugar levels in tea. I take it without asking. So, it is at that level that we have come to reconcile.\" \n\nAsked what lessons he had learnt from the way he had handled the dispute with Dr Gono, Kereke said: \"First, my advice to bosses is: If a junior has done something which you feel is not in congruence with what you would want, communicate effectively. \n\n\"You don't lock the door and assume you have communicated. So, our separation with Dr Gono created the false impression that we had a lot of bad issues against each other. I couldn't understand why all of a sudden I was shut out. So, it's communication. \n\n\"Secondly, resolve your disputes as much as possible through dialogue. It is the right way. The results are much, much more effective. Look, we could have dragged each other to the courts, but the moment we took the dialogue way, information started to flow, exchanging files which clarified a lot of issues.\" \n\nHe went on: \"And we were saying, 'What was the problem.' All these years fighting when all these grey areas could have been cleared in a matter of a few weeks through proper dialogue. So, my advice would be don't choose the aggressive path of fighting. If anything, embrace each other in the context of your difficulties; put communication and sensibility ahead of everything else . . . \n\n\"It was wrong and very, very bad. And I am sorry for that. . . Let me state it again boldly, handina kufoswa. It's the conscience to want to do the right thing.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Zimbabwe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Kereke apologises to Gono, not to girl he raped","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bulawayo24 News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"431092668","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"256"},"name":"Bulawayo24 News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bulawayo24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203291196","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img.bulawayo24.com/articles/thumbs/65x52/kereke-jailed.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The prevalence of type two diabetes is growing at a frightening rate and we are seeing younger patients with this type of diabetes, which was almost unheard of 20 years ago. \n \nDiabetes can have a devastating effect on the leg and foot. Today, I want to share two stories with you about what my patients have experienced. \n \nPATIENT ONE \n \nWe shall call this young lady Jane for the sake of the article. Jane was a 35-year-old teacher who was an insulin-dependent diabetic. She had been diagnosed at age 13 with type one diabetes. This is where the pancreas stops producing insulin. It is often diagnosed in early childhood and the cause is not yet known. \n \nThe condition had left her with severe numbness in her feet (neuropathy). One evening while dining at home with her family, she became aware of a burning smell. Jane couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on where the smell was coming from. \n \nShe sent one of her children to the kitchen to check if she had left anything on the stove. It was turned off. \n \nThe smell became progressively worse and after about five minutes, her youngest child looked under the table. She screamed out in horror when the source of the burning smell was discovered. \n \nFor the entire meal, Jane\u2019s foot had been resting on a lit mosquito coil and it had literally burnt a hole through her flesh. Jane could not feel a thing due to the neuropathy, even when she looked at her burning flesh. \n \nShe washed the foot with cool water and wrapped it in a bandage and decided to visit me the next day. \n \nNow, what she should have done was to go to her local hospital for emergency treatment, but because of how late it was when the incident occurred and having to take care of two young children, she left it until the following day. \n \nWhen she arrived at my office her foot was swollen, infected and hot to the touch, but Jane could not feel a thing. Of course, this gave her a false sense of security. \n \nIt took four months of intense treatment to heal the foot. Luckily, she only needed to have one toe amputated. Had she waited longer to seek assistance the situation could have been more grave. However, if she had attended the hospital on the night of the injury, we could have been able to save the toe. \n \nThe moral of this story is to immediately seek help if you have any injury or problem with your feet and you are diabetic. \n \nTo be able to feel pain is a defence mechanism. It warns you of danger and alerts you to injury. If you lose your pain sensation you become vulnerable. This can be as simple as a pair of shoes rubbing against a toe where the patient cannot feel it. This can ultimately lead to amputation. \n \nBe aware of your surroundings; wear supportive, roomy footwear and check your feet for injury every night. \n \nPATIENT TWO \n \nWe will call patient two John. John had type two diabetes, which means there is insulin resistance in the cells of the body. \n \nThe cause includes obesity, hereditary factors, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle. John was a well-controlled diabetic patient. He was fairly well educated in the knowledge of how to look after his feet. He knew it was important never to go barefoot as he had neuropathy and could not feel anything up to his ankles. \n \nOne day he went up a ladder to pick fruits from a tree in his yard. As he finished he jumped down the last steps and headed towards the house. He kicked off one of his yard slippers and put his foot in his house slipper. As he tried to kick off the other slipper he noticed that it wouldn\u2019t come off. \n \nHe looked down to see a six-inch nail poking through the top of his shoe and it had wedged his shoe to his foot. He felt no pain at all. \n \nJohn sensibly wrapped the foot with the shoe and nail still attached in a towel and took a taxi straight to the hospital. That night he underwent surgery and his foot was saved. \n \nHe attended my office for the next few months for follow-up treatment and now he is fit and healthy. \n \nThis story had a great outcome. John sought immediate medical help when he saw how serious the situation was. The advice from this story is similar to the last. Wear the appropriate footwear for the job at hand. A flimsy pair of flip-flops were obviously not adequate. \n \nThe good thing is that he sought treatment immediately and didn\u2019t try to deal with the situation himself. I have seen patients over the years who have had a very bad cut and have been trying to self-treat. With the diabetic patient this will often lead to infection and possible amputation. \n \nIn my next article I will focus on how to protect your feet and diabetic foot health education. \n \nAngela Davis BSc (Hons) DPodM MChS is a podiatrist with offices in Montego Bay (293- 7119), Mandeville (962-2100), Ocho Rios (974-6339), Kingston (978-8392), and Savanna-la-Mar (955-3154).

Let\u2019s see what he has been up to. \n \nGareth weighed in at 482 pounds on Januray 24, 26 pounds down from the 508 pounds he weighed in September 2016. When we last checked in with Gareth, he had lost 27 pounds since his start date. \n \nStill reeling from the holiday period that was compounded by his duties as a chef and his effort to deliver superior products for his Christmas cake catering business, this masked a bigger problem \u2014 his food addiction. \n \nBeing faced with food all day has been tough mentally for Gareth, but he is seemingly getting stronger everyday. \n \nAs a result of the constant battle, Gareth gained a few pounds, causing him to slip on his weight loss target, but the coaching by Selena DeLeon of Core Fitness Studios has helped him to get back on his feet and drive his heels down in a new resolution for 2017. \n \nThe support of the followers on social media and from those people who recognise him everywhere he goes has also helped him to regain his mindset and get himself back on track. \n \nOver the 10 days prior to his weigh-in on January 24, Gareth lost five pounds. This was due largely to him eating on time, every 3.5 to 4 hours, increasing his water intake, and committing to walking four days per week. \n \nGareth is now so excited about his progress that he has added a fifth day at the beach where he swims, walks in the water and in the sand for an extra burn. The activity also helps him with his blood circulation problems, which he has developed as a result of the excess weight. \n \nHis carbohydrate portions are now carefully measured \u2014 no more than two fingers of green banana per meal \u2014 and the meats are slowly transitioning from stewed, which is his trade specialty, to grilled and baked instead. \n \nHe needs the daily contact with his coach to stay on top of things, and this communication has helped him tremendously. He knows that he has a weakness, so he keeps his daily food diary and sends it in every night as a rule so that he is held to account. This his has been the one thing that has really made the difference over the 10-day period. \n \nThis is the time of year when most people battle to uphold their new year\u2019s weight loss resolutions and maybe feel the confines of their commitments around about now. One thing that we can remember is that when we feel that we are struggling with our own hurdles of pounds to lose, there is always someone else out there who has to dig even deeper. The support that we all can show Gareth is helping to lift him up out of a place where he sometimes feels deeply trapped, and this also serves us to know that our own goals are also possible. \n \nTake heart in knowing that if it is possible for Gareth to overcome this fight, it is possible for you too. \n \nYour support goes a long way in helping to keep Gareth going on his #journeyof100pounds. Use the hashtag and log on to the \n \nJamaica Observer social media as well as Core Fitness Studios to throw your support behind this young man\u2019s journey back to health and a better life.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Gareth gets back on track","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203295889","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Luis Obispo","zipCode":"93401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Luis Obispo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"San Luis Obispo.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659768","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"316"},"name":"San Luis Obispo.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sanluisobispo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203297481","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Melbourne City coaching staff are hopeful that marquee man Tim Cahill will be fit to take his place against local rivals Melbourne Victory in the third A-League derby of the season next Saturday night, a game that will prove pivotal to the finals hopes of both teams who are currently struggling for form.\n\nThe Socceroo star failed to complete an hour in City's latest disappointing performance against Newcastle on Friday when the A-League's rich kids went down to their rather more humble opponents in a game played at Coffs Harbour.\n\nCity officials on Sunday said that they had no major fitness concerns ahead of the derby save for two players, Corey Gameiro and Steve Kuzmanovksi, who have been out all season with serious injuries.\n\nCahill went off after just 64 minutes of the game against Newcastle, replaced by Anthony Caceres as City tried to get back in the game.\n\nHe had been sore before that match, and at his age - he is now 37 - it is to be expected that the unique demands of the Australian league, with its long distance travelling, matches on hard pitches and in warm conditions, might take their toll. He is, however, City's second highest scorer this season with seven goals and he has managed to net big goals at important times in key matches.\n\nThe veteran forward sat on the bench with his leg iced for the remainder as he looked on while City sought, in vain, to overturn the two-goal lead the Jets had taken through former Victory striker Andrew Nabbout.\n\nBruno Fornaroli's penalty was as close as they came, and while it brought the City skipper's personal goal tally this season to 12 and kept him in second place in the race for the golden boot, it didn't do much else.\n\nCity has fallen into a hole since its season high point, the 1-0 FFA Cup final win over Sydney courtesy of a Cahill header. They are the only side to have beaten the runaway league leaders this season, but since that win, on November 30, they have been poor.\n\nIn nine games since they have only won twice and picked up a possible 10 points out of 27. It is now virtually impossible for them to win the Premiers Plate, and if they do not beat Victory on Saturday then they could be dragged into a dogfight to even make the finals if they continue in their current vein of form.\n\nVictory only has one major absentee for the derby - first choice centre half James Donachie, who was shown a red card in the 2-1 home loss to Sydney that virtually extinguished Kevin Muscat's team's hopes of winning the Premiers Plate.\n\nThey go into round 18 11 points behind Sydney, and while they do meet the Sky Blues once more - in Sydney in early March - they would need the front runners to effect a spectacular collapse to catch them.\n\nVictory does have a handy five-point cushion over the fifth placed Brisbane Roar, whose last-gasp Brett Holman winner against Western Sydney Wanderers lifted them into third spot with 27 points, just one ahead of City.\n\nPerth Glory missed a golden opportunity to close the gap on City to just two points when they surprisingly lost to bottom-of-the-table Central Coast, leaving them five points adrift of City with the Jets just a point behind Glory on 20 points.\n\nWellington and the Wanderers both still also have hopes of becoming involved in the finals race as pressure mounts in the final third of the season.\n\nA defeat in the upcoming derby could make life difficult for City, who have a large number of away games in the final weeks of the campaign, and see the big spending club dragged into a battle for one of the lower level spots in the top six. That wasn't anything anyone was predicting two months ago when they lowered Sydney's colours to win their first ever silverware.\n\nYes, City did have an excuse against Newcastle in that travel problems meant they did not leave Melbourne until 5.30am on the day of the match, ensuring a less-than-ideal preparation.\n\nBut if they fail to deliver to expectations by season's end few will be prepared to cut them any slack given the resources at their disposal.\n\nVictory should make the playoffs without any bother despite their recent slump in form.\n\nKevin Muscat's side, after winning six on the spin, has now crashed to defeat in their last three games.\n\nThey were soundly beaten in Wellington, unlucky to concede twice in the last 13 minutes in Perth when they were leading 1-0, and were stiff not to get something out of the Australia Day clash with Sydney.\n\nWhile the Sky Blues are deservedly top of the pile after their 17-game unbeaten A-League record, Muscat remains defiant and believes that Victory have the weapons to defeat Arnold's men should they clash in the finals.\n\nVictory were the better team in the first hour of the Australia Day game and could, and probably should, have been in front by that stage.\n\nBut their frailty at the back was exposed by Sydney's relentless approach, and Muscat will have to tighten things up ahead of the derby.\n\nBoth teams boast an array of attacking talent - Victory have Marco Rojas, Fahid Ben Khalfallah, Besart Berisha and James Troisi while City can call upon Cahill, Fornaroli, Nicolas Colazo and Fernando Brandan - so there should be goals in this game.\n\nWhether there will be anything as stunning as the world-class drive with which Cahill announced himself to the Australian football public in the first derby - a 4-1 win for City - remains to be seen.\n\nCity has had big problems this season breaking down teams who defend in depth against them, as Newcastle showed on Friday night.\n\nThat is one thing they won't have to worry about on Saturday as Victory will look to take the game to their cross town rivals and establish an early domination, which might leave space in transition for the likes of Fornaroli, Bruce Kamau, Colazo and Brandan.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 56 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203299437","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\" \n \nAnother sticking point is training. \n \nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium. \n \nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1. \n \nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match. \n \nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was. \n \n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said. \n \nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries. \n \nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December. \n \n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said. \n \n\"It was really great. Next week might be asking too much, but at least she's back in the frame now and she's running herself around.\" \n \nW-LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL \n \nCanberra United v Melbourne City \n \nA-LEAGUE ROUND 18 \n \nSunday: Central Coast Mariners v Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium, 5pm.

Police will allege Baccus punched a man during an altercation near Sydney Airport.\n\nPopovic said the matter had no bearing on the preparation or outcome and was quick to brush aside any suggestion of such after the match.\n\n\"We had no dramas. We had no dramas with Kearyn. That was dealt with. He was fine,\" Popovic said. \"He played very well. I thought he had a very good game, like most of the team tonight.\"\n\nWestern Sydney were forced to play with 10 men for a crucial final 10 minutes of the match. The Roar were quick to up the energy on a humid night in Brisbane and had the stroke of luck they needed as the clock ran down and Holman's strike slipped through the hands of keeper Vedran Janjetovic.\n\nDefender Scott Neville was marched after his second yellow card, which was a straightforward booking compared to the first when he was ruled to have made contact with Thomas Broich as he scooted towards the box.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that incident deserved a card, Popovic replied: \"The referee did. That's all that matters, doesn't it?\"\n\nJanjetovic appeared to keep his side in the contest in the second half as he rattled off a series of high-quality saves, making his final play of the night a bitter pill to swallow.\n\nPopovic was sympathetic but said he felt his stopper had little work to do prior to the attempt at saving Holman's 20-yard heave.\n\n\"It's part of football. He's been fantastic since he's come in. He had very little to do today. He saved a few balls from outside the box. They had many shots from outside the box, which shows how good our structure was,\" he said.\n\n\"In the end, it was a shot from outside the box that was our undoing. That's how it goes sometimes.

She did not say whether or not she would demit office before September, but information emerging from within the party suggested that the change would become reality before March. She also did not say whether or not she would step down as Member of Parliament for St Andrew South Western at the same time she vacates the presidential chair. \n \n\u201cThe officers in an informal meeting three weeks ago set a deadline of somewhere between January 20 and 26 for the official nomination exercise of the new leader to take place and for a special delegates\u2019 conference to be held on Sunday, February 19 and have the election,\u201d one former Cabinet minister told the Jamaica Observer on Friday. \n \n\u201cAll plans were being put in place, some were completed, but the party leader kept not turning up to meetings and many of the Comrades got upset. People believe that the party is suffering too much, and it is leaderless,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity. \n \nAnother PNP elected official told the Sunday Observer that a group of parliamentarians debated the idea of informing the governor general that they no longer wanted her to be leader of the Opposition, and would therefore have her replaced. \n \nHowever, that would be a last resort, as the embarrassment of pushing aside such a party faithful could have devastating consequences, the official said. The official also stated that no PNP MP would participate in such an exercise, unless voting was by way of secret ballot. \u201cA vast majority of the PNP MPs, maybe up to 80 per cent of them, would tell you that it is time for Portia to go, but none would vote by a show of hand and none would dare to lead a move to effect such a thing. All of them would even deny that they wanted her out,\u201d the official said. \n \nA letter was also prepared for Simpson Miller to agree, sign and clear the way for the transition, but she has still not done so, the official stated. \n \n\u201cOne of the excuses that she has given for not finding the time to do certain things, like signing off on her departure, is that her sister died recently and she was grieving,\u201d the official went on. \n \n\u201cShe has avoided attending executive meetings in recent time, not that she used to attend regularly anyway, but this is proving to be too much of a distraction for the party and is contrary to the original agreement when she agreed to retire as party president,\u201d the official said. \n \nParty leaders are also upset with Chairman Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Pickersgill for what they said was his not following through with the officers\u2019 position and outlining their feelings to Simpson Miller that the party was \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d. \n \n\u201cEverything seems to be in limbo, and for the party to move forward and be respected again it needs to reorganise and rebuild. There is nothing called leadership in the party. The JLP has been making all kinds of mistakes and hardly anything is being said or done about it by the PNP. The president is ineffective and irrelevant and the man who is likely to succeed her, Dr Phillips, can do nothing because he has no power, no authority to act. So in the meantime, the JLP is having a ball, and who knows, they might want to capitalise on their slim majority in Parliament and call a snap election if things remain in limbo in the PNP,\u201d he lamented. \n \n\u201cEven the upcoming budget debate, there is no clear party position on what is to be debated. Our party leader needs to listen to sound reason, and not the voices of that trade unionist and the woman who is involved with communication,\u201d the official argued. \n \nPNP General Secretary Julian Robinson declined to comment on the matter when the Sunday Observer contacted him on Thursday. \n \nThe Sunday Observer was reliably informed last night that about 20 MPs met to discuss the issue yesterday, but it was not clear if a common position was taken. \n \nApart from Simpson Miller, other senior party officials are expected to retire from elective politics this year, among them Pickersgill, who has suggested that he will step down as chairman and Member of Parliament for St Catherine North Western, after over 25 years of direct involvement in the political process. \n \nPickersgill\u2019s exit will open the door for a potential three-way race for chairman, which could involve members of parliament Anthony Hylton and Fitz Jackson, who declared their interest last year; as well as chairman of Region Three (Corporate Area) Phillip Paulwell. \n \nHowever, some veterans of the party believe that the next chairman should be MP and spokesman on national security Peter Bunting, who temporarily doused his ambition to become party president when he revealed that he would not challenge Phillips for the top post. \n \n\u201cBunting should be the next chairman,\u201d one said. \u201cIt would be a good show of party unity and would, in some measure, be used as a way to possibly groom him to succeed Phillips later on. It would be good for Phillips to support Bunting to play this role, seeing that Bunting yielded and allowed for a no-contest as far as the presidential election was concerned,\u201d the veteran said. \n \nPaulwell has not officially declared his intention, but the Sunday Observer can report that he has been doing his own mobilisation. He, too, is also said to be gaining \u201csignificant support\u201d. \n \nInformation reaching the Sunday Observer also indicates that Jackson is being urged to step aside in order to facilitate Paulwell\u2019s candidacy, and a proposal is also to be made to Hylton as well to avoid a run-off. \n \nVeteran MPs Dr Omar Davies and Derrick Kellier are also slated to step down this year. Davies, a former minister of finance, and minister of transport, works and housing, had said he would demit office as MP for St Andrew Southern, although he did not give a specific date. He vacated the post of chairman of the constituency last year to lawyer and former Minister of Justice Mark Golding, who is widely expected to succeed Davies as MP for one of the most depressed constituencies in Jamaica, which has lacked development since the departure of its once energetic MP, Anthony Spaulding in the 1980s. \n \nKellier is expected to step down as MP for St James Southern, although the party has asked him to stay on so as to avoid a by-election that could strengthen the ruling Jamaica Labour Party\u2019s hand if a new PNP candidate is involved, considering the closeness of Kellier\u2019s victory over now Mayor of Montego Bay Homer Davis which led to a magisterial recount. \n \nThe party had pencilled in the name of former Mayor of Montego Bay Glendon Harris to succeed Kellier, but his loss in the Local Government Election in the Maroon Town Division of the St James Municipal Corporation all but extinguished hopes that he had of sitting in Gordon House as the people\u2019s choice from St James Southern.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"PNP set to implode","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203305847","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s definitely 2017. But yes - I\u2019m reviewing an instamatic camera. \n \nThe Sofort is a metaphorical slap in the face to decades of digital progress; a completely analogue, almost completely manual compact that spits out your pictures on honest-to-goodness film every time you press the shutter. \n \nIt\u2019s also the least expensive Leica you\u2019re ever going to see. Forget splashing out thousands on bodies (and an equal amount on lenses) - you can snap up a Sofort for a relatively wallet-friendly £230. \n \nBut aside from providing lyrical inspiration to 90s UK indie popsters Babybird, what\u2019s the point in going instamatic? \n \nThe double-headed hydra of nostalgia and instant gratification, of course. \n    PRETTY AS A PICTURE    \nThe Sofort wasn\u2019t as slim and svelte as I was expecting, based on Leica\u2019s drool-worthy promo pics, but then I shouldn't have been too surprised. It's based on Fujifilm's Instax Mini 90, with only a few tweaks from the German camera company. \n \nIt\u2019s still a real looker, though, with a reassuring heft to it once you\u2019ve slapped in some film. \n \nWhite is probably the subtlest of the three colour choices, but nothing about this is subtle - which is why I went for mint green. There\u2019s also a bright orange, which is equally eye-catching. \n \nWhichever you go for, you\u2019re getting a chunky compact slab of camera, with a collapsing lens and only a few basic buttons to run your mitts over. \n \nAs well as the all-important shutter button up top, you get exposure compensation, a self-timer and flash control, as well as a button for toggling through the Sofort\u2019s shooting modes. You get the choice of standard, party, macro, sports, double-exposure and bulb, plus that most crucial of 21st century camera functions - a selfie mode. \n \nApart from the rechargeable battery, this is really the only concession for modern day photographers. There\u2019s even a little selfie mirror just above the lens, helping you line up your arms-length shots without wasting film. \n \nLeica reckons the rechargeable battery will last for 100 shots, so you\u2019ll probably have long emptied your wallet on replacement film before the camera runs out of charge. \n \nThe lens extends when you power the Sofort on, and has a focusing ring for switching between close-up and far shooting. A simple LCD screen shows which mode you\u2019re in, as well as how many shots are left in the camera, but that\u2019s pretty much it as far as electronic assistance goes. \n   Pictures in a Pop      A NEW DEVELOPMENT    \nPoint the lens-y end at your subject, look through the teensy tiny optical viewfinder, and hit the shutter button. That\u2019s really all there is to it. \n \nThe Sofort snaps a picture and then ejects your photo, accompanied by a satisfying soundtrack of mechanical whirring. Didn\u2019t your school teach you that \u201cSofort\" means \u201cInstant\u201d in German? \n \nIt\u2019ll take a couple of minutes for your pics to develop, though. Right out of the camera, they\u2019re completely white, but give it some time and they\u2019ll transform in front of your eyes. \n \nFocusing can be a bit hit-and-miss, even when you\u2019ve got the lens set to the right distance for your subject. Sometimes close-ups look great, and other times you\u2019re lacking any real detail. But then that\u2019s half the charm of instant film, right? \n \nYou\u2019re normally fine for landscapes and subjects more than 10 feet away, but you\u2019ll need to make sure there\u2019s enough light - the Sofort needs a lot of it to expose your shots well. The flash is an all-or-nothing deal, too. It's too weak for filling out night scenes, but too fierce for up-close portraits and selfies. \n \nSwapping out packs of film takes seconds - just flip the door release switch, tip out the old pack, and slot the new one in. The camera ejects a dummy print and you\u2019re good to go. Just remember it\u2019s at least a tenner every time you drop in a new set of ten prints. \n \nShutter bugs will find things get costly quick with a Sofort in their camera bag: a 10-shot pack of Leica's colour film costs £25, and monochrome will set you back £15. Fuji's Instax film costs less, so you can get 40 shots for around £30, or 75p a print. \n   ANALOGUE MEETS DIGITAL      PICTURE THIS    \nEach print is no bigger than a credit card, whether you opt for Leica\u2019s own film (in colour and monochrome flavours) or Fuji\u2019s Instax-mini film. I tested with a few packs of Leica\u2019s colour stock. \n \nEither way, you\u2019ve got to manage your expectations when it comes to quality. \n \nMost of my shots had enough clarity, with rich, vibrant colours that you just can\u2019t get from a digital camera. Well, without slapping a load of photo filters on afterwards in editing, anyway. \n \nThat\u2019s only if you\u2019ve fed it enough light, though. A lot of times I thought a subject was well-lit, but the resulting print was mostly dark. The bulb mode is handy if you\u2019ve got a tripod, as you can pull of some pretty decent long exposures, but there\u2019s no cold shoe for adding a more powerful flash. \n \nI loved the double exposure mode, which creates ethereal dreamscapes from simple shots. You\u2019ve got to have a good eye to get great results, too - there\u2019s no digital magic overlaying your shots before you press the shutter button here. \n \nSometimes, though, you just won\u2019t have got the shot you were hoping for. The perils of instant film: either you got the exposure wrong, or the flash didn\u2019t quite do what you were expecting. The results can either look washed out, or too dark to make out any details. \n \nIt\u2019s here you\u2019ve just got to suck it up and try again, learning from your mistakes. Which might sound bizarre to anyone that\u2019s only ever shot on digital, but I love that all-or-nothing attitude that died out when film cameras took a back seat to modern technology. \n \nIf clarity is all you\u2019re after, there are instant alternatives out there that just edge out the Sofort. Polaroid\u2019s Snap Touch might use a digital sensor and zero-ink printing instead of classic film, but there\u2019s no question it crams in more detail into every shot. \n   MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD      Leica Sofort Verdict     \nThe Sofort is simple, takes alright instant photos, and owning one won\u2019t force you to take out a second mortgage. \n \nLet\u2019s be honest, this is the closest I\u2019m ever going to get to actually owning a camera with that fabled Red Dot on it. Tech journalists aren\u2019t really part of Leica\u2019s regular customer base. \n \nIs that enough to see past the Sofort\u2019s limits, though? For me, yeah, it probably is - I\u2019m just that much of a logo snob. \n \nFor everyone else, though, this is a camera you\u2019ll have fun using, but the Fujifilm Instax it is based on will be the better, cheaper buy. \n      Tech Specs      FILM COMPATIBILITY   Instax-mini (Leica, Fujifilm)     BATTERY LIFE      DIMENSIONS   124x94x58mm, 305g        Stuff says...  It\u2019s got gorgeous looks and oozes retro appeal, but you\u2019re paying for the name.

Whoops? Ever since the greatest golfer of this generation laced them up at the end of 2016, signalling a return to action, there has been a clamour for his competitive return. \n \nNostalgia is a dangerous beast in sport, because it creeps up on all of us in a manner that exposes even the most cynical among us as eternal romantics when it comes to happy endings. \n \nEven the PGA, as Trump-American as it gets when it comes to whipping a mob up into a frenzy, couldn\u2019t help themselves in the build-up to the Farmers Insurance Open this week. The biggest tour in the world has a new promotional video doing the rounds, continuing on their \u201cThese Guys Are Good\u201d theme. \n \nWoods, even when he was AWOL, always formed part of their marketing campaigns. Now that he is back inside the ropes, the PGA couldn\u2019t help themselves. There was a video released recently, which is again centred on emphasising how difficult life is on Tour. \n \nOne by one, some of the brightest stars the Tour has seen list the number of victories they have, the astonishment growing with each number. Daniel Berger \u2013 1. Patrick Reed \u2013 5. Jordan Spieth \u2013 8. Sergio Garcia \u2013 9. \n \nThen the really big numbers come. Dustin Johnson \u2013 12. Jim Furyk \u2013 17. Phil Mickelson \u2013 42. All of these names are heroes in their own right, and many may yet go on to accomplish significantly more in their careers. \n \nBut, to a man, Tiger Woods dusts what they have achieved with his numbers. Seventy nine Tour victories is a ridiculous number, and the genuine sense of admiration at the scale of his achievements is evident in each of his peers as they repeat his number, is telling. \n \nTiger Woods, love his game or loathe his lothario past, remains the biggest drawcard in the game of golf. Almost all of golf wants at least one more Tiger dance, because everybody wins when Woods is in business. \n \nDuring his latest, extended absence from the sport through injury, the sport found other names to get familiar, and those names found other means to get inspired on the back nine on Sundays. But, always, inevitably, there was one eye on the mooted return of the TW. \n \nNow that he is back, and signed up to play a lot more regularly over the next month, the narrative switches from hope to cope. Will Tiger Woods, the 2017 version, live with the demands of what surrounds him, and will he be able to deliver the ultimate punchline? \n \nIt is a compelling question, and the earliest evidence suggests that it will be a struggle. Missing a cut happens, even to the very best. \n \nJust as each one of his peers in the PGA promotional clip have won big, they have all missed cuts in their time. It happens, because golf at the sharpest end of the knife is especially fickle. If your game is not razor-sharp, you will come short. \n \nJust as Tiger did. The cut he missed on Friday won\u2019t be the last of his career, but it represents the challenge now in front of him. \n \nBetween now and the end of it all, Woods is not playing against his rivals. He is playing against the ultimate enemy, Father Time. That foe is the only one that never misses a cut, and if Woods even manages just one more mainstream victory, the golf world will go to town in reverence. \n \nYou can be sure that the PGA already has that Tiger #83 clip in storage, just waiting to press play if he somehow breaks Sam Snead\u2019s ridiculous record of Tour victories. The only problem, of course, is that they may be waiting for a long time. Ten years ago, it was almost obligatory that Woods would smash the win record before he was done. \n \nNow, after everything that has occurred, all that wasted time, the four victories he needs to stand alone would be the biggest of his life, because the odds are getting unlikelier by the week. Father Time never has, and never will stand on ceremony for anyone. \n \nNot even a Tiger. \n \nSunday Independent","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Lungani Zama"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Time waits for no-one, not even Tiger","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Cape Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672929","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Cape Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capetimes.co.za","publisher":"Independent Online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203311188","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/file/1/2092890/1479962847/image/1268155331.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Protea netballers came within a whisker of claiming their biggest scalp since 1995 as they ended regulation time on level terms with England before going down 60-55 in extra time after a gutsy display in the Quad Series in Durban. \n \nSouth Africa erased a 10-point deficit after half-time as they steamrolled their way to a one-point lead shortly before the final whistle only to see England level the scores. \n \nEngland ultimately dealt better with the pressure during the added 14 minutes as they outscored South Africa 12-7. \n \nPlaying in front of a vociferous and packed arena, the Proteas made a promising start to their return match against the England Roses but as in the previous game they dropped the intensity to allow the visitors back into the game. \n \nIt was a case of deja vu as the Proteas grabbed an initial three-point lead but squandered the advantage thanks to some sloppy play in the middle of the court. \n \nSouth Africa\u2019s lead lasted all of 11 minutes before the English levelled the scores on 8-8 with the visitors then taking control. \n \nThe second quarter belonged to England as they ran into the right spaces and quickly added to their score. \n \nThe Proteas on the other hand could not convert their chances into points as goal attack Renske Stoltz and goalkeeper Lenize Potgieter (pictured, with ball) experienced some nervous moments with their shots at goal. \n \nStoltz, who made her national debut against New Zealand in 2016, succeeded with only 40 percent of her attempts in the first quarter while Potgieter\u2019s aim was slightly better with 66 percent. \n \nSouth Africa only managed to add seven points in the second quarter while the English scored 17 times to give them a 10-point lead going into half-time. \n \nWing attack Izette Lubbe replaced Proteas captain Bongi Msomi in the second quarter for what seemed like a tactical move. \n \nAt that stage it looked like the Roses would be running away with the game as was the case in the previous match in Melbourne which they won 57-44. \n \nLike a bolt out of the blue, though,South Africa found an extra set of legs as they scored goals in quick succession following the half-time break. \n \nReplacing Stoltz, goal attack Lindie Lombard added a sense of urgency in the frontline as South Africa blitzed to a 8-1 goal advantage in the first five minutes of the third quarter. \n \nPlaying with greater confidence and aggression, South Africa looked more organised and more intent than they did in the first half-hour of the match. \n \nGoing into the final quarter South Africa were feeling bullish as they trailed England by just four points (38-34) and they continued their resurgence in the last 15 minutes. \n \nSouth Africa surged forward as they enforced the stalemate with 10 minutes left in the quarter before grabbing the lead for the first time since the opening moments of the match. \n \nHolding on to a slender lead, South Africa had to keep a defiant England at bay as the final minutes of the game turned into a tit-for-tat battle as the lead changed a few times up until the final seconds. \n \nFacing the prospect of only their second victory over England in 22 years, South Africa buckled under the pressure in extra time as they saw the tourists move past them to deny them a piece of history. \n \nWeekend

I don\u2019t know what to tell him. I don\u2019t know if he is dead or alive. \n\u201cHe left Nigeria on May 23. That day, he came home from work while I was in the market. He called me on the phone to ask where I was. The next time he called, he said he was in Benin (the Edo State capital) on an urgent visit which he did not explain. \n \n\u201cThe following day, I received a text message from him. He told me to pray and fast for him that he was travelling to look for better life. I was shocked because he told me nothing. He knew I would never agree to it. \n \n\u201cI informed his family and realised he had told them and they kicked against it.  Few days later, I received a call from him. He said he was in a location from where they would start the journey (through the desert) to Libya. That was the last day I heard from him . \n \n\u201cI have been calling that same number ever since just to hear from him; just to know if he is breathing or if he is alive. I just want to know what has happened to my husband.\u201d \n \nMonths went by with the expectation that David would call his wife. With each passing day, Aminat\u2019s hope loses strength, but she holds on with faith that someday, a call would come through to bring her back from the limbo in which she and her children had been. \n \nOne day, she received a call from a relation. \n \nShe said, \u201cThe person called to condole with me about my husband\u2019s death. I don\u2019t know where the rumours came from. I was confused. People were calling to condole with me. Even my first child asked if it was true that his father was dead. \n \n\u201cIf someone dies, at least I would know I am a widow and would resign to fate. But I don\u2019t know whether he is dead or alive. That is the hardest part of my life right now.\u201d \nDetails about the life of David revealed that there was probably nothing his wife could have done to prevent him from embarking on the journey. The seed of living and working abroad was first sown in his mind in 2009, his sister, Caroline Diolulu, said. \nThat year, after encouragement from friends who painted rosy tales of life in Europe, with savings and money from family, David decided to embark on the journey to Libya. \n \nJust before crossing the desert, he abandoned his trip and came back home. The road was too dangerous, he said. \n \nBut his restless spirit was not done. \n \nBy 2015, David set his eyes on Dubai. \n \nHoping to join a pastor in his church who was working in Dubai, David sought the help of someone who facilitated his visa. \n \nBut again, things turned awry once he got to the United Arab Emirate. \n \nHis sister, Diolulu told Punch that, \u201cThe person who helped him with the visa told him that if he stayed for three months, he could get a work permit. \n \n\u201cWhen he got there, he started misbehaving and no longer listened to the man who took him there, he made friends with other people who he thought could help him faster. But they could not help him until his visa expired. \n \n\u201cHe came back to Nigeria and again got another visa and travelled back to Dubai. I don\u2019t know how he did it. Again, he could not get an employment until his visa expired.\u201d \n \nDavid\u2019s family thought that he would finally settle down at home. After all, he was not doing badly. \n \nBut they were wrong. \n \nHe got a job as a supervisor with a company servicing some of the facilities of telecommunications company, Globacom. His contract soon ended. He got another job from which he was laid off thereafter. \n \nWhile looking for another job, his Europe dreams came back and he started making overtures to his sister, Diolulu, to help him financially in order to embark on the journey. \n \n\u201cHe said he wanted to go to Libya and I told him flatly that I would never support that. I reminded him about the danger on the road which made him abandon the same dream in 2009. \n \n\u201c But he told me all his friends had crossed to Europe. They were the ones encouraging him . He blocked his ears to every advice we gave him. \n \n\u201cHis friends in Europe would always call him and say \u2018What are you still doing in Nigeria?\u2019 I always told him not to listen to them because his destiny might be different from theirs. But he never listened to anybody but his friends.\u201d \nIn mid-2016, David finalised his plans to travel through the desert to Libya and onward to Europe without his wife\u2019s knowledge. \n \nFew days after he left Nigeria, a company he applied to finally called to offer him a job. \n \n\u201cHe actually gave my phone number on his application. I was the one they called when they told him to come. I told them he was no longer available,\u201d Aminat said. \n \nUnknown to Aminat, her husband had run into trouble after successfully making the journey from the desert to Libya. \n \nRather than call her, he called his sister, Diolulu, whom he believed could help him raise money. \n \nDiolulu said, \u201cWhen he got there, he started calling me to send money. He said the person that wanted to take him across was demanding N170,000 (about $560) \n \n\u201cHe was very desperate; he said everybody he arrived in Libya with had all gone. I refused to send him any money because I told him I was not in support of his trip. \n \n\u201cBut he raised money and got to Libya. When he got there, he became stranded. The pressure was too much. Every now and then, he would call.  He was always calling me. He said he was about to die in Libya and needed the money desperately. I finally sent him N180,000 . \n \n\u201cThe day he confirmed that he had got the money, he told me that he had paid the person who was going to take him across the sea. He told me he was leaving the next day.\u201d \n \n\u201cI told him that if that was his wish, may the Lord see him through.

Their research shows that Denmark often wielded more influence than is commonly thought. (Photo: United States Air Force / USGOV-PD / Wikipedia )   \nBASIC RESEARCH \n \nAs tensions grew between the USA and the Soviet Union after the Second World War, a newly liberated Denmark would find itself caught between the Cold War ambitions of two super powers. \n \nFree from the constraints of five years of foreign occupation, Denmark was keen to exert its position on the world stage and exert their scientific sovereignty over Greenland, which had become a strategically important island to the US during the Second World War. \n \nThis story of top secret diplomatic wrangles, military operations, scientific research, and botched media cover-ups, is now documented in a new book \u201cExploring Greenland: Cold War Science and Technology on Ice.\u201d \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of intrigue in this story,\u201d says Associate Professor Kristine Harper, a former meteorologist and oceanographer turned historian of science, from Florida State University, USA. \n \nHarper was a senior researcher in the Exploring Greenland Project that ended in 2013 and co-edited the new book published in 2016. \n \nRead More: American adventurer captured 1930's Greenland on film \n Declassified documents reveal full extent of political struggles  \nThe book reveals the full extent to which the US government and military tried to gain territorial control of Greenland, and the increasingly three-way \u2018David and Goliath\u2019 style politics that ensued between Denmark, Greenland, and the US. \n \n\u201cWe already knew that the US was deeply interested in Greenland in the Cold War. But we didn\u2019t know the full extent of their research programs,\u201d says Ron Doel, an associate professor of history at Florida State University, USA, and one of the senior researchers on the Exploring Greenland project. \n \nRevisiting newly declassified archives revealed previously unknown details on the extent of US interest in Greenland and that Denmark had more influence on US activities than is often assumed, says Doel. \n Construction on Camp Century began in 1959 without permission from Denmark. (Photo: US Army / Wikipedia )   \nThe researchers trawled national and private archives on both sides of the Atlantic to reveal new insights on both Danish and US perspectives from the time (see Fact Box). \n \nRead More:  Greenlandic fjords get their organic matter from Russia \n US interest in Greenland began in the Second World War  \nThe US government first became interested in Greenland during the Second World War, when Denmark was occupied by German forces. With its strategic position, located right in between the US and the war in Europe, the allies were certain that Greenland should not fall into enemy hands. \n \nGreenland was a vital stopover spot for allied aircraft, and weather stations around the country provided essential data for developing accurate European weather forecasts, which were crucial for allied success in battle. \n \n\u201c[The allies] needed to occupy Greenland with their own military forces, as they certainly didn\u2019t want the Germans to occupy it,\u201d says Harper. \n \nRead More:  Greenland melt linked to weird weather in Europe and USA \n 1941: US military moves in  \nOn the same day that German troops marched into Denmark on the 9th April 1940, the US agreed to provide military protection and supply goods to Greenland. \n \nWhen the US entered the war in 1941, Henry Kaufmann, the exiled Danish Ambassador to the US in Washington, agreed to allow them to build military bases in exchange for recognition of Danish sovereignty. \n \nThey immediately got to work, building military bases, airstrips, and research stations. They trained around 7,000 new meteorologists and deployed some of them to weather stations around the Arctic. \n \nIn 1944 there were 5,795 US military and civilian personal deployed at bases across Greenland--almost a quarter of the island\u2019s total population (21,412). \n Inside Camp Century. Officially it was designed to investigate ice and atmospheric conditions year-round and to test polar construction methods. In reality, it was to make way for another top-secret project known as Project Iceworm. (Photo: US Army )   \nBy the end of the war, the US Army Weather Service had installed 14 weather stations, as well as operating 13 Danish stations, built before the war. They had even claimed control of several clandestine German weather stations on Greenland\u2019s inaccessible east coast. \n \nSee the timeline of US military and scientific interest in Greenland in the video at the end of this article . \n War ends and a nuclear arms race begins  \nAfter the war, Greenland lost none of its strategic importance to the US. Located almost equidistant between themselves and the emerging threat from the Soviet Union, many in government saw Greenland and the Arctic as the stage for World War III, and a warming, ice-free Arctic Ocean as a new gateway for a US invasion by the Soviets. \n \n\u201cGreenland was absolutely central to the North American continental defence,\u201d says Doel. \n \n\u201cIn one article I saw from Time magazine, January 1947, someone at the Pentagon had declared Greenland as the world\u2019s largest stationary aircraft carrier. That captures it. It was their base of operations,\u201d says Doel. \n \nBut it was no longer enough to be allowed to operate in Greenland. With the Cold War already in sight, the US government now wanted to own it. \n \nRead More: Climate Change research was born in the Cold War \n Denmark is caught off guard  \n\u201cWhen the Danish Foreign minister visited the US in December 1946 the US Secretary of State asked him right away to sell Greenland,\u201d says lead scientist Matthias Heymann, associate professor at the Centre for Science Studies in the Department of Mathematics, Aarhus University, Denmark, and co-editor of the new book. \n \n\u201cThe Danish Foreign Minister wasn\u2019t aware that this would happen, he went there to tell his American colleagues that the US forces should leave the island,\u201d he says. \n \n\u201cThe Danish government were rather shocked by the US interest,\u201d says Heymann. \u201cThey weren\u2019t aware, at that point at least, of the immense interest of the US forces in Greenland.\u201d \n \nThe new project discovered that Denmark had much more influence on US activities in Greenland that is commonly thought.

But the offer was firmly rejected. \n \n\u201cDenmark is a small country, and they\u2019d just had an experience of being occupied by a strong foreign power in the Second World War. They didn\u2019t want to let that happen again,\u201d says Heymann. \n \nAt the same time, tensions were still running high with the Soviet Union, who had only left the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea that spring. \n \nIn rejecting the US offer, the Danish government had drawn a line in the sand: Greenland was not for sale. \n \nRead More:  Greenland in numbers: eight key statistics to understand the world\u2019s largest island \n Denmark establishes its own research agenda  \nDenmark would now exert its sovereignty over Greenland in the only way they could. \n \nThey immediately set to work clawing back control of key scientific institutions and research activities in Greenland. \n \nAlmost immediately they established the Greenland Geological Survey, and funded explorations to map landforms and mineral deposits. And soon, weather stations became a bone of contention. \n \n\u201cArctic weather stations set up in the Cold War matter a lot in terms of sovereignty,\u201d says Doel. \n \n\u201cIf you\u2019re setting up a station in northern Canada with US observers, is this saying that the US has sovereignty over this part of Canada, because Americans are running the weather stations? That sort of plan concerned the Canadians, and it\u2019s also why the Danes wanted to control stations in Greenland,\u201d he says. \n  \nNewly declassified documents give fresh insights \n \nThe new project synthesises perspectives of Cold War events from both Denmark and the USA . \n \nTheir research showed that Denmark had more influence on US activities than previously thought: \n Denmark halted US reconnaissance flights to collect data on Soviet activities using air balloons.  Danish scientists collected top-secret data on the aurora activity on behalf of the US.  A plan to construct top-secret nuclear missile launch sites (Project Iceworm) was shelved partly in response to perceived Danish opposition .  \nSources: Ron Doel and Kristine Harper \n  \nRead More: Greenland lags Alaska and Canada in involving locals in climate science \n Reality bites and US retains control  \nThe Danish Foreign ministry was keen to take control of the weather stations, but there was just one problem: \u201cThey couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d says Heymann. \u201cThey repeatedly promised to send staff, even signed contracts defining the amount of staff to be send, but for years to come they didn\u2019t live up to these promises.\u201d \n \n\u201cScientific institutions in Denmark, like the The Danish Meteorological Institute, were more realistic. They said, \u2018We can\u2019t do this, we don\u2019t have the staff, there\u2019s just no way.\u2019 But the foreign ministry responded, \u2018We have to comply to protect our sovereignty effectively, so you have to make it work.\u2019 And this went on for years between 1940 and 1950,\u201d says Heymann. \n \nUnable to provide enough trained meteorologists, the US continued to operate most of the stations. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a small story, but interesting as it shows the enormous interest by the Danish foreign ministry to get full control,\u201d says Heymann. \n \nResignation in the face of US resources would be a recurring theme in the coming years. \n \nRead More:  See what life is like when you study climate change in Greenland \n Sovereignty settled in 1951 but conflicts remain  \nA formal agreement in 1951 set new ground rules for US research in Greenland. It guaranteed Denmark\u2019s full sovereignty over the island, and allowed the US military to maintain their military bases in strictly defined areas. But all scientific and military activities outside these areas had to be approved by Denmark. \n \n\u201cAt that point, the Danish authorities felt much more relaxed as the sovereignty concern was settled once and all. But during the 1950s, concerns kept rising again. The Danish government were continually surprised by the enormous extent of US activities,\u201d says Heymann. \n \n\u201cThe major place in Greenland became Thule Air Base in Northwest Greenland. Thule was the largest airbase outside the US territory, which shows how important it was. It was also the hub for all kinds of scientific activities,\u201d says Heymann. \n  \nMethods \n \nResearchers from Aarhus University, Denmark , and Florida State University, USA , studied documents from: \n The Danish National Archives.  Personal collections in Denmark.  Four Presidential archives in the USA.  The National Archives in Washington, DC, USA.  NATO archives in Brussels.  \nThey investigated all aspects of scientific research and political struggles between the US, the Soviet Union, and Denmark during the Cold War. \n \nThe results were published in a number of scientific papers between 2010 and 2013, and summarised in the new book . \n \nSource: Matthias Heymann \n  \nConstruction of Thule begun in 1951. In 1954, the US established the TUTO scientific research camp, amongst others, where they launched their explorations and scientific monitoring campaigns on the ice sheet. \n \nLater came Camp Century, a \u201ccity under the ice\u201d powered by a nuclear reactor. Controversially, construction began in 1959 outside the designated military areas and without prior approval from Denmark. \n \nRead More:  Climate change research was born in the Cold War \n Sovereignty challenged at a cocktail party in Copenhagen  \nThe first request related to the construction of Camp Century was an informal letter from the US in 1959. Denmark, fearful of a Soviet reaction, said no. \n \n\u201cThen in August 1959, the US ambassador in Copenhagen informed the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs informally during a cocktail party, that US forces had already started to build Camp Century on the ice sheet,\u201d says Heymann. \n \nThe shocked minister immediately called emergency meetings with his colleagues to discuss their response, but in effect there was little that they could do. \n \n\u201cThey felt uncomfortable admitting in any way that the US exercised de facto military sovereignty, which was effectively ceded to the US as Denmark didn\u2019t have the power to stop US forces,\u201d says Heymann. \n \nRead More:  International conference brings climate change to Greenland \n Danish media censorship failed  \nUltimately the project was allowed to continue, and in return, the Danish Foreign Minister insisted on a total media blackout. \n \nBut it was too late. Just days before, and unbeknown to the Danish authorities, a US publication, \u201cThe Sunday Star\u201d, had published a full feature on the camp. The story was out. \n  \nScientific Sovereignty for Greenlanders? \n \nNone of the documents studied in the new project came from Greenland. \n \nThe researchers did not go to Greenland throughout the entire project. \n \nThis leaves many avenues of research open. \n \nResearchers still have few insights into how Greenlanders viewed these changes and challenges brought about by the Cold War in their home country. \n \nFor example, the forced removal of entire Inuit communities to prevent interaction with US military. \n \nSource: Exploring Greenland: Cold War Science and Technology on Ice. \n  \nAll the Danish Government could do now, was to convince the Parliament and the Danish public that the project was entirely civilian and control press access to the site. \n \nThe Danish Embassy in Washington was already censoring journalists\u2019 reports on US activity in Greenland, removing references to anything that was politically sensitive and rewriting the narrative to one of civilian science. \n \nJournalists were permitted to visit, but their trips were severely limited and Denmark forbade all contact between US personnel and the local Inuit. \n \nRead More:  The majority of researchers in Greenland are foreign. Does it matter? \n US military: a headache for Denmark  \nThe official story told to both the Danish and the US public was that Camp Century was a civilian base, built to \u201cpermit year-round studies of weather and snow in a highly strategic area,\u201d according to documents collected during the project. \n \nBut Camp Century was much more than that. Here, the US studied all major sub-disciplines in geophysics--seismology, meteorology, climatology, glaciology, geomagnetism, and the properties of ice and snow, says Heymann. \n \nBut the real purpose was a test site for innovative polar construction, intended to make way for an even bigger scheme: Project Iceworm, a 135,000 square kilometre military installation designed to hold 600 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles that could be launched from over 2,000 mobile launchers, hidden beneath the ice on a moving rail-road. \n \nPlanning for Project Iceworm began unbeknown to the Danish government. Only the Danish Prime Minister at the time was aware of possible US nuclear activities in Greenland (see Fact Box). \n \nThe Danish parliament would not find out about plans for Project Iceworm until the 1990s, and many of details are still classified, held in the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Kansas, USA. \n \nRead More: Uncovered First World War documents reveal widespread state censorship \n Still a sensitive issue      Basic Research  \n\n \nScienceNordic takes you into the engine room of basic research to find out: \n What is it?  Who does it?  And how does it benefit us?  \nRead More: What is basic research? \n  \nBy the late 1960s, the US military interest in Greenland had begun to subside. New technology made Greenland strategically less important, as medium and long-range ballistic missiles could now be launched from submarines. \n \nCamp Century was closed in 1967, as engineers realised that the ice was not as stationary as they had once thought. And operations at Thule Air Base, once the largest aircraft base in any US territory, were downsized. By 1968 only 1,189 US personnel remained. \n \nEven the question of who should maintain and operate weather stations became less sensitive as they were increasingly automatised. \n \nBut the US never left. A fact that remains a politically sensitive issue to this day. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s still a flyover point and it\u2019s still a place where the US military are listening and watching. There are big installations up there and no one will give that up any time soon,\u201d says Harper. \n \nA recent study highlighted another politically sensitive issue brought about by climate change. Scientists predict that waste from Camp Century could once again be exposed as the Greenland ice sheet melts. Leaving a difficult question as to who is responsible for the clean up\u2014Denmark, USA, or Greenland. \n \nRead More:  Greenland lags Alaska and Canada in involving locals in climate science \n Greenlanders were side-lined  \nToday, the technology developed by military research activities in Greenland laid the ground work for climate scientists from around the world to obtain long ice cores, both in Greenland and Antarctica. \n \nIt was Danish, US, and Swiss scientists that established the first ice-core drilling project for purely scientific reasons. Today, scientists from all over the world fly to Greenland to study the changing ice and oceans every year. \n \nThese data have allowed scientists to develop working models of ocean and atmospheric circulation, to reveal centuries of climate change, and confirm the existence of man impact on our climate and sensitive Arctic ecosystems. \n \nBut the battle for scientific sovereignty is not over yet. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange story, because it\u2019s all about Greenland, but it\u2019s in the hands of the US and Denmark. The Greenlandic population had no say in [what was happening there].\u201d says Heymann. \n \nThe Greenland Home Rule was established in 1979 and today Greenland is an autonomous administrative division within the Danish Realm with its own ever expanding scientific research agenda. \n \nOrganisations like the University of Greenland and The Greenland Survey ASIAQ in collaboration with both Danish and international research institutions continue to shape the future of scientific activities in Greenland. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nSee how events in the Arctic unfolded as the US became increasingly interested in Greenland as a place for military activities and scientific research.

(Reuters)  \nWith US President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown set to affect corporate America in various ways regarding their hiring and with liberals coming out on streets in huge numbers to protest the step, protests have broken out across the country asking for the order to be rescinded fast. Although a US judge has ordered a temporary ban on US president\u2019s temporary immigration ban, the protesters have stayed on the streets and airports. Here are the live updates: \n \n1.25 PM: The Academy has reacted after Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi would not be able to enter the US for the Oscar awards under Trump\u2019s recently enacted travel ban Variety. Academy, after branding the ban \u201cextremely troubling\u201d said, \u201cAs supporters of filmmakers \u2014 and the human rights of all people \u2014 around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran \u2018A Separation,\u2019 along with the cast and crew of this year\u2019s Oscar-nominated film \u2018The Salesman,\u2019 could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin,\u201d statement released by the Academy\u2019s official spokesperson read, Variety reported. \n \n1.15: Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said today that US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban arrivals from seven Muslim majority countries was \u201ca great gift to extremists\u201d. \u201c#MuslimBan will be recorded in history as a great gift to extremists and their supporters,\u201d Zarif said as part of a string of tweets. \n \n1.05 PM: Indian-origin American actor Kal Penn has started a CrowdRise fundraiser in the name of a commenter who told him he doesn\u2019t belong in the US. The message appeared to be written in an Instagram post of 39-year-old Penn\u2019s, in which he spoke out about the personal effect President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim Ban\u201d is having on him and his friends, reported People magazine. \u201cFamilies are being torn apart,\u201d Penn wrote. \u201cShame on us.

He said, \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely.

those two awards were presented by Kidman and her husband, musician Keith Urban respectively.\n\nThe event was staged at the Ray Dolby Ballroom, adjacent to the Dolby Theatre, the home of the annual Academy Awards.\n\nOther VIPs in attendance included Australia's consul-general in Los Angeles Chelsey Martin, actors Rachel Griffiths, Paul Hogan and Daniel MacPherson and the directors Baz Luhrmann and Phillip Noyce.\n\nThe Australian and American national anthems were performed by Australia's Hugh Sheridan and Wé McDonald, a contestant on the US version of The Voice, respectively; Australian singer-songwriter Vance Joy also performed.\n\nThe black-tie gala, which is also attended by Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop and trade minister Steve Ciobo, is the somewhat colourful icing on a larger, more serious government cake, the G'Day USA trade mission.\n\nThat mission, first staged in 2004, promotes Australian food and wine, fashion, film and the arts, defence industry and technological innovation; in recent years it has also included our expertise in water and drought management.\n\nThe foreign minister and trade minister have been in the US for the last week as part of a travelling roadshow, more fancifully referred to as the business of \"economic diplomacy\".\n\nIn addition to the gala, nicknamed \"G'Day LA\" and held in Los Angeles, there are events staged by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across the US, including San Francisco, Austin and New York.\n\nAs part of that roadshow Mr Ciobo delivered an economic outlook address in New York, and was the guest of Texas governor Greg Abbott at an \"Australia-Texas BBQ\" at the governor's mansion in Austin.\n\nMs Bishop delivered a keynote address on the role of Australia and the US in the Indo-Pacific at the Skirball Cultural Centre in Los Angeles.\n\nDespite the fact that this year's G'Day USA trade mission has taken place largely in the shadow of a turbulent handover of power in the US, Mr Ciobo told Fairfax Media it was a success.\n\n\"We are always, of course, focused on Australia's national interest, but the US and Australia have been very close friends for decades and and I'm very confident we'll continue to be for a long time yet,\" he said.\n\nAustralia's trade with the US in goods and services is worth about A$60 billion a year and Mr Ciobo said the trade mission was an opportunity to reinforce Australia's \"diversified and mature\" economy.\n\n\"On the west coast, for example, we highlight the benefits of being able to produce film and television shows in Australia; in each particular area we focus on our natural strengths,\" he said.\n\nMr Ciobo said G'Day USA was largely unaffected by US president Donald Trump's decision to nix the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade agreement.\n\n\"Australia will continue having conversations on the TPP 11 or 12-1 approach, and that's with other countries excluding the US, but there's always opportunity to drive the relationship forward,\" Mr Ciobo said.\n\nAustralia also has an existing free-trade agreement with the US, the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA), which was signed in 2005.\n\n\"That's the architecture that drives the [Australia-US] relationship,\" Mr Ciobo said. \"That provides a good framework for our trade relationship and investment relationship.\"\n\nThe G'Day USA event is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with Austrade and Tourism Australia.\n\nIt is sponsored by organisations including Australia Unlimited, Qantas, the United States Studies Centre at The University of Sydney and the American Australian Association. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"G'Day USA 2017 honours Hollywood's man of the moment, Ben Mendelsohn","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2548","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Merimbula","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merimbula News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348386233","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Merimbula News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.merimbulanewsonline.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203351226","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/478c78d7-1569-4008-b762-46b7943daa9f.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Its story is intertwined with that of Robert MacGregor Rodger, Chrysler's young chief engineer. Part of the team that launched the brand's first Hemi V8 back in 1951, Rodger was disheartened by the fact that Chrysler did not have a production car that was good enough to handle the performance of his 331 cubic-inch Hemis, which were beginning to dominate the drag racing scene and making a mark at Le Mans in Briggs Cunningham-built cars.\n\nSince the corporation didn't have enough budget to develop a special car from scratch to showcase the Hemi, Rodgers, with help from chief designer Virgil Exner, envisioned a new car that would borrow styling and parts from three existing Chrysler cars. Bolting the Imperial's nose on to a New Yorker's hard-top two-door body and the Windsor's rear quarter, they produced a brand-new car, which was introduced in 1955 as the C300. With two four-barrel carburettors, a solid lifter cam, large dual exhausts and special manifolds, the 5.4-litre Hemi under the C300's long bonnet produced 300 horsepower, helping the car breeze through to 100kph in just about 10 seconds and hit a speed of over 200kph.\n\nNot only the most powerful production car of its time, it also handled like a dream thanks to its heavy-duty suspension, which was uprated to cope with the extra power. It was also one of the most elegantly designed American cars of the era, with its smooth, flowing lines and restrained use of chrome.\n\nBut it was not just on the road that the C300 established its name. A fleet of C300s fielded by Mercury Outboard founder Carl Kiekhaefer dominated Chevys and Fords in the 1955 Nascar Grand National season with driver Tim Flock taking the Drivers' Championship and winning 18 of the 38 races he entered. It also won the AAA Championship and finished first-in-class at Daytona's Flying Mile.\n\nA legend was born, and while the C300 was a limited-production model, it spawned a line of so-called Letter Cars to which the current 300C traces its roots.\n\nUnderstandably getting hold of a 1955 C300 today is going to be a very expensive mission.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution.

Attendees were ecstatic about the visit, which Pence said was encouraged directly by President Donald Trump. \n \nProtestors came from far and near to march from the Washington Monument to the steps of the Supreme Court. \n \nEmily Boudreaux, a 22-year-old college student who attends Louisiana State University of Alexandria, voted for Trump. She arrived at the rally about four hours early to get a front row view of Vice President Pence. \n \n\u201cTo know our movement has support from the White House just makes you think that this can go further,\u201d she said. \n \nTaisya Gowlovech, an 18-year-old student at O\u2019Gorman High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said she drove in a vehicle with her best friend for 28 hours to be a part of March for Life. She, too, wanted to see the vice president speak on behalf on the president. \n \n\u201cThe vice president coming makes more people want to come,\u201d Gowlovech said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting more people on board.\u201d \n \nThe crowd was noticeably youthful. Demonstrators from Catholic schools and Right to Life student organizations were visible everywhere, and marchers packed Constitution Avenue for more than an hour. \n \n\u201cThis is because of Donald Trump,\u201d said Kristin Hawkins, President of Students for Life, an anti-abortion organization that focuses on millennial outreach. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of optimism that we\u2019re going to see a lot of great things come out of the administration.\u201d \n \nHowever, that optimism is also paired with caution. Hawkins said that just because President Trump has promised to defund Planned Parenthood, reinstated the Mexico City Policy and promised to push restrictions on abortion providers, the movement will have to continue to hold the administration accountable. \n \nMonica Stuckwisch, who works with the American Association of Pro Life OB/GYN\u2019s, said she didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Trump in part because he didn\u2019t make abortion a common talking point on the campaign trail. Instead, she cast her ballot for Darrell Castle of the Constitution Party. \n \nAlthough Stuckwisch recognizes President Trump\u2019s flip-flop on abortion since the \u201890s, she said Pence reassured her at the rally that the administration was fighting for her side. \n \nGreg Ingel of Detroit, Michigan, was another front-row supporter at the March for Life protest. He proudly sported a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and said he voted for the president because of the Supreme Court. \n \nIngel said he wasn\u2019t one-hundred percent sure about Mr. Trump\u2019s personal views on abortion, but Pence\u2019s participation at the rally gave the March for Life \u201ca new enthusiasm.\u201d \n \nMr. Trump may have not been the perfect candidate for many in attendance. But most felt he could ensure a swing of power in the US Supreme Court that could lead to the repeal of the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973, which legalized abortion nationwide. \n \nKansas Governor Sam Brownback was one of many Republican politicians in attendance. He, like many, reiterated the importance of President Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nomination, which is due to be announced next Thursday. \n \nContinue reading at CBSNews.com. \n \nThe post appeared first on KTVA 11 .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Bat / CBS News"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"March for Life attendees express hope for Trump presidency","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anchorage","zipCode":"99503","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anchorage","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KTVA CBS 11 Anchorage","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169752425","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1087"},"name":"KTVA CBS 11 Anchorage","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ktva.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-life-abortion-opponents-washington/","http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-donald-trump-presidency-could-mean-for-planned-parenthood-womens-health/","http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-the-mexico-city-policy/","http://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-life-attendees-express-hope-for-trump-presidency/"],"sequenceId":"695203359147","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T05:33:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d14rj7v0r2qnrv.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/28203619/640x360_70127P00-UXIJC-300x169.png"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 56 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Palm Beach","zipCode":"33410","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Palm Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WPBF","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"name":"WPBF","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wpbf.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203359699","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pierce","zipCode":"98405","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tacoma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tacoma News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661174","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3846"},"name":"Tacoma News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thenewstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203364564","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That is a ­Constitutional violation.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Clair","zipCode":"62220","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Belleville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belleville News Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659187","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1944"},"name":"Belleville News Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bnd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203376241","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n In New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released.  \n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n \n Airport arrests  \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n   \n\n  \nProtestors rally at John F. Kennedy International Airport. \n  \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CNN.com - RSS Channel - Mobile App Manual"},"topics":[{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Second weekend of protests after Trump\u2019s travel order","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mercer","zipCode":"61231","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Aledo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WRMJ - 102.3 FM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556516848","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WRMJ - 102.3 FM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://wrmj.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://katu.com/news/local/protest-disrupts-traffic-at-portland-international-airport","http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/2-iraqis-file-lawsuit-after-being-detained-in-ny-due-to-travel-ban/index.html","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=LzNpaHUUgfU:XXpqy55AZEg:yIl2AUoC8zA","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=LzNpaHUUgfU:XXpqy55AZEg:7Q72WNTAKBA","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=LzNpaHUUgfU:XXpqy55AZEg:V_sGLiPBpWU","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=LzNpaHUUgfU:XXpqy55AZEg:qj6IDK7rITs","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=LzNpaHUUgfU:XXpqy55AZEg:gIN9vFwOqvQ"],"sequenceId":"695203377271","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

Those 111 appearances have come over around four years, and he's failed to establish himself as a regular in Liverpool's starting XI under Klopp, with the German often preferring versatile playmaker Roberto Firmino in the central striking role. \n \nThe Reds boss has become frustrated with Sturridge's history of injuries and conceded that the England international simply doesn't play enough games for him to have a future under him at the club. \n \n\n \nKlopp is aware that, at his best, Sturridge is capable of being one of English football's most clinical goalscorers, but numerous fitness issues have clearly taken a toll on the 27-year-old, who now appears to be a shadow of the player he was two or three years ago. \n \nWith that said, the former Borussia Dortmund manager believes that the end of the season is the right time to let arguably his most talented and most recognised centre-forward go. \n Who would replace him?  \nKlopp would surely love a reunion with Dortmund hitman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, although the deadly pace merchant is on the radar of giants like Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid . \n \n\n \nPromising Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams is the name most often linked with a move to Anfield, while for Sturridge, it would be very difficult to find a club of the same size as Liverpool. \n \nEvery top side in England already seems to have a top-class striker, from Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Manchester United and Arsenal 's Alexis Sanchez to Chelsea's Diego Costa and Man City talisman Sergio Aguero. \n \nDo YOU think Klopp should sell Sturridge in the summer, or is it still too soon to say?

(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) \n \nThe Homeland Security Department says a New York court order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban will not affect the overall implementation of the White House executive action. \n \nThe agency said the court order affected a relatively small number of travellers who were inconvenienced by security procedures upon their return. \n \nThe department's statement said: \"President Trump's Executive Orders remain in place\u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" according to the DHS statement. \n \nStephen Miller, a senior adviser to the White House, said that nothing in the judge's order \"in anyway impedes or prevents the implementation of the president's executive order which remains in full, complete and total effect.\" \n \n___ \n \n11 p.m. \n \nForeign-born U.S. residents who could have been barred from re-entering the United States under President Donald Trump's immigration order have been allowed back into the country. \n \nThat's according to a Department of Homeland Security official who briefed reporters on Saturday night. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n \nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n \nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n \nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n___ \n \n9:40 p.m. \n \nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n \nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n \nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n \nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n \n___ \n \n7 p.m. \n \nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n \nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n \nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n \nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n \nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n \n___ \n \n1 a.m. \n \nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n \n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n \nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n \n____ \n \n12:20 a.m. \n \nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n \nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n \nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from travelling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n \nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n \nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \n___ \n \n12:10 a.m. \n \nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n \nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n \nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n \nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n \nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n \n____ \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n \nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n \nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n \n____ \n \n11:20 p.m. \n \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n \nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n \nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n \nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n \nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n \nMore than 75 per cent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n \n___ \n \n10:20 p.m. \n \nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n \nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveller from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n \nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n \nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \n___ \n \n9:50 p.m. \n \nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n \n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n \nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n \n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n \n___ \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n \nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n \nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n \nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n \nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n \n___ \n \n8 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n \nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n \nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n \nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n___ \n \n7:05 p.m. \n \nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n \nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n \nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nTrump signed the order Friday. \n \n___ \n \n6:40 p.m. \n \nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n \nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n \nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n \nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n \nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been cancelled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n___ \n \n6:35 p.m. \n \nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n \n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n \nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n \nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signalled he will take a kinder approach. \n \n___ \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n \nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n \nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenceless children and families.\" \n \nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n \nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n \n___ \n \n5:15 p.m. \n \nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n \nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n \nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n \n___ \n \n3 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n \nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n___ \n \n2:45 p.m. \n \nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n \nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n \nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n \nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n \n___ \n \n1 p.m. \n \nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n \nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n \nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n \nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n \n___ \n \n12:30 p.m. \n \nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n \nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n \nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n \nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"R2X","state":"Manitoba","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Winnipeg","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Winnipeg Free Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661237","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24"},"name":"Winnipeg Free Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203395639","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again?

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

The technique to design materials, such that they are as less flammable as possible, is a conventional one. Unless we make these methods foolproof, there will always be a danger of fire. Thus, improving firefighting techniques is an utmost priority, and today, we will cover the five most incredible advancements in modern-day firefighting! \n\n1) Sweden\u2019s futuristic firefighting helmet \n\n[Image Source: Omer Haciomeroglu]This helmet looks like some gadget from sci-fi movies, as it integrates futuristic projections and entails various technologies in a single device. Critical information like the temperature, remaining Oxygen and Carbon dioxide levels, brightness index, etc. are displayed on the helmet\u2019s screen. This display helps the firefighter to make informed choices and take measured risks. A thermal imaging camera is also installed as an aid to visibility in case of thick smoke. \n\n[Image Source: Omer Haciomeroglu] \n\n2) Fire shelters made from space-age materials \n\nThe concept was first discovered in 2013, after a tragic fire on Yarnell Hill in Arizona, at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center. Since then, researchers have collaborated with the U.S. Forest Service to integrate their space-age technology to improve the odds of the heroic firefighters. \n\nNASA engineers have created shelters of the thickness of a millimeter, with the lightest prototype weighing almost 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg). It can be rolled up into the size of a half-gallon milk container, making it extremely handy. The amazing fire shelter is due to launch in 2018. \n\n3) Fire extinguishing grenades \n\n1900\u2019s \u201cGrenade\u201d style extinguisher [Image courtesy of Wikimedia]The earliest fire grenades were round glass bottles filled with salt water. These bottles were thrown into the blaze in a bid to extinguish it. Today, more complex compounds, like carbon tetrachloride, have replaced water in these grenades. Although some of these chemicals have their associated disadvantages, yet, no one can deny their importance in firefighting. \n\n4) Firefighter on Jetpacks \n\nA Tunisian company has created a new turbine design that uses rotating fan blades and produces up to 1 kW of electricity in a product, called the \u201cBiometric Wind Converter.\u201d The plan entails carbon fiber wings flapping in a figure-8 motion, which gives the turbine a capability to move both up and down. \n\nThe idea was adopted by Dubai Civil Defence and is now, integrated into its \u2018Dolphin\u2019 system where their firefighters use jetpacks\u2019 water pressure to move the vantage points in emergency situations. The system also comes with a thermal camera that helps in search and rescue missions, and is indeed, the most impressive addition to the high-tech armory of the firefighters! \n\n5) Sonic fire extinguishers \n\nThis state of the art apparatus is known as wave extinguisher and uses acoustic waves to suppress flames instead of using any liquid or chemical. The extinguisher uses sound to extinguish the fire, which makes it ideal for usage. In summary, the vibrations of the sound separate the air from the fuel, which stops the oxidation process and kills the blaze. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on these technologies?

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Miami-Dade","zipCode":"33172","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Miami","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Miami Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657045","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"833"},"name":"Miami Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.miamiherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203416902","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Digitization is still \nin its early stages, and is used mainly as a tool for accelerating \nsocio-economic development, particularly in improving digital and \nfinancial inclusion. \nHowever, through its Vision 2025 strategy, Pakistan aims to \ncomplete its transition to a knowledge-based economy, creating a \nglobally competitive and prosperous country that provides a high \nquality of life for all its citizens. \nVision 2025 aspires to a more advanced digital society. Digital \ndevelopment can drive increased engagement between individuals and \ninstitutions, provide huge growth potential and productivity gains \nin all sectors, and enable more advanced and innovative government \nservices. \nPakistan\u2019s mobile sector is in a unique position to support the \ncountry\u2019s digital development for three key reasons: \nMobile can connect more people than any other technology, \nparticularly in underserved rural areas, mobile can provide secure \naccess to a variety of digital services such as health and education \nand mobile can provide a platform to provide financial inclusion, \nengaging many people in the economy for the first time. \nIn parallel, innovative services that run over mobile networks \ncan support many of the government\u2019s Vision 2025 objectives, such as \nincreasing enrolment in education, improving food security and \ndriving private sector growth. \nMobile operators in Pakistan are playing their part in \ninnovating to deliver the services that will accelerate progress \ntowards the goals of Vision 2025 \u2013 and in doing so generating \ngrowth, jobs and investment in wider economy. But they have an \nopportunity to do more. \nThree key areas require immediate attention: a competition \npolicy that considers all market players, not just telecoms service \nproviders, in a technology-neutral environment aimed at preventing \nbottlenecks and exclusionary conduct; clear and simplified licensing \npractices based on function rather than technology or legacy \nindustry structures, which can accommodate the rapidly changing \nmarket and encourage investment and innovation; and a new framework \nfor physical network cooperation (including network and spectrum \nsharing) that is light-touch and focuses on general competition \nprinciples and transparency. \nThere is a real opportunity for the government, institutions, \nmobile operators and the wider mobile industry to work together to \nmake the regulations a better fit for modern digital ecosystem, the \nreport maintained.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Pakistan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Internet access news","group":"Internet"}],"title":"GSMA anticipates sound 3G, 4G growth in Pakistan till 2020","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"PK","country":"Pakistan"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Associated Press of Pakistan","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169700726","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Associated Press of Pakistan","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.app.com.pk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203418357","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I've never been much for relaxing on a blanket under the shoreline sun for hours. One of my least favorite things is the tedious trudge through cracked shells minefields and hot, soft sand on the way to the waves.Another of those \"least favorite things\" is the return from the beach coated with gazillions of sticky grains of sand.My burdens on a trek to the surf have consisted of the obligatory swim trunks, rash guard shirt, visor hat, beach towel and - for longer stays - a folding chair. Mind you, it's a full-sized chair, not one of those low-slung beach chairs that I find quite uncomfortable and unwieldy.If the grandkids are in tow, I might take a boogie board and a kite. But, usually not much more.I think, then, that I can be forgiven for not keeping up with all the gizmos on the market that have been designed to make walks to and hours on beaches easier.One such item that caught my attention is the Rinsekit Shower. I noticed it advertised in a Jersey Shore promotional magazine.\"No more muddy dogs or sandy feet,\" it promises.The $90 pressurized portable shower is the panacea for those who visit beaches with no public showers or even courtesy hoses with spray nozzles for quick feet and legs rinsing.The Rinsekit stores two gallons of water and pumps it out at 65 pounds per square inch, about the power of a home faucet.The product was invented by California surfer Chris Crawford, who often found himself stranded on a strand, up to his ankles in crud, and with no shower nearby.More power to the surfer dude and anyone who buys one of his inventions. He found a need and filled it. I hope he sells many.His firm is even expanded its product line with models in either black or white, a portable water heater for the device, and some sort of a $50 accessory kit that injects pressure into the water tank with a bicycle pump.But, those are 140 bucks I'm not likely to spend.I have successfully navigated many treks to the tides without the aid of contraptions such as those bubble-wheeled carts. Only when absolutely obliged (or ordered) to do so do I lug a beach umbrella or canopy.But, I speak with a certain smugness, knowing that 199 steps from the sand is an outside shower and an air conditioned beach house.

He, apparently, didn't know it was a date and thought I just wanted a friend to hit the slopes with. And he, apparently, didn't realize how sexy I thought his snowboarding skills were. \n \nSo I scooted closer to him on the lift and declared that I needed warming up, an invitation to wrap his arm around me. That night, we shared our first kiss. \n \nWhile most of our weekends are consumed with surfing, snowboarding is a close second when winter months roll around. We've surfed and snowboarded in the same day, taken quick weekend getaways to nearby Big Bear, or made the longer trek to Mammoth Mountain. \n \nWe sighed with sadness when we realized last year our snowboard gear had collected dust all season. Having our second child just before winter made it impossible. \n \nSo when my husband, Jon, editor for action sports website GrindTV, told me about a trip he had to take in early December to Breckenridge for the Dew Tour festival, I let out a desperate plea. \n \n\"Can I come?\" I asked. \n \nDon't get me wrong, I love my kids. But any parent with two young children will tell you that sometimes you just need a break from the crying and screaming and servitude that come with being a mom. And thankfully, gracious grandparents allowed us to make our getaway. \n \nThe flight from Orange County was easy, a 2 ½-hour jaunt into Denver. With snow in the forecast, and we being native Californians who freak out about driving in any kind of weather, we opted to hitch a ride with Colorado Mountain Express. \n \nAs we got closer to the mountain, the snow really started to come down. We were just about jumping out of our seats at the sight of fresh powder. \n \nA passenger in the caravan had a tip for us as we arrived at the DoubleTree hotel, known for its chocolate chip-walnut cookies at check-in. \n \n\"Hit the bar across the street at Beaver Run; the drinks are way cheaper over there,\" said Phil, a ski judge in town for the competition. It was too late to hit the slopes when we arrived, so the bar across the street would be our first stop. \n \nThe next morning, we woke to a winter wonderland - the storm had brought about half a foot of new snow, and the town was buzzing about it. \n \nWith my husband already on the mountain covering the competition, I found myself sharing the gondola with local skier Susan Briggs, who was heading up to watch her niece, Keri Herman, in the women's ski slopestyle event. \n \nIt turned out Briggs was an expert on the topic of love on the slopes. After meeting on match.com six years ago, she and her now-boyfriend Dan Herman had their first date on the slopes. \n \nWith Dan, she knew it was love on first lift. \n \nThat got me excited to see my hubby, who was able to sneak away from work long enough to take a few runs with me. \n \nWe felt like our younger selves as we raced down the mountain. We stopped, sneaking a kiss as we took a moment to soak in the beauty surrounding us. \n \nThe food options in Breckenridge are endless. One night, we stuffed ourselves at Michael's Italian Restaurant, putting back all those calories we burned on the slopes. The tortellini I ordered swam in a basil cream. \n \nOn our last night we found a meal to satisfy our chilly bones as the snow continued to fall, at a Vietnamese joint called Pho Real that had opened a few months before.

We believe it's a path. We always have to be working toward peace and justice in our lives.\" \n \nFounded by Quakers during World War I, the organization has been promoting peace and justice as an expression of faith in action. The centennial exhibit, on display at the African American Museum of Philadelphia through April 30, is divided into four categories: \"Ending Discrimination,\" ''Addressing Prisons,\" ''Just Economies,\" and \"Immigrants Rights.\" \n \n\"Ending Discrimination\" includes two 8-by-8-foot photos, one showing shows a group of civil activists led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. facing a wall of police officers in the 1960s, the other taken in Baltimore in 2015 after Freddie Gray died in police custody. There's also a first-person account from a former committee staffer who resisted Japanese internment during World War II. \n \nIn \"Addressing Prisons,\" visitors can crowd onto a floor mat that mimics the size and shape of the 5-by-7-foot solitary confinement cell that committee employee Ojore Lutalo occupied for more than 20 years. \n \n\"I really wanted to tell personal stories,\" said exhibit coordinator and content developer Elizabeth Tinker, an independent museum professional. \n \n\"We want to encourage discussion,\" she said. \n \nOne interactive feature highlights the challenges facing immigrants. Set up like a giant board game, visitors allow rolls of oversize dice to determine citizenship paths. Millionaires and star athletes have a much easier time than those who have family members already in the U.S. \n \nAsylum seekers with proof of persecution have an easier time immigrating than those without proof - but it's still not easy. Tinker noted that this one category also illustrates why many people enter the U.S. illegally: What parent wouldn't risk violating the law and leaving their home if they feared their children were in danger there? she asked. \n \n\"This isn't telling people what they should think but giving them the information and opportunities to see videos of immigrants talking about why they're here and the challenges they face,\" Cretin said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Natalie Pompilio"},"topics":[],"title":"Exhibit: Quaker group marks milestone with \"Waging Peace\" display","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Berks","zipCode":"19601","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Reading","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Reading Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169721556","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1255"},"name":"Reading Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.readingeagle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203425281","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country.

They were forced to play with only five defencemen and 11 forwards following the previous night\u2019s injury to Noah Philp and the addition of captain Cale Fleury to the CHL\u2019s Top Prospects game in Quebec City. \n \nTo make matters worse, Kootenay picked up a penalty in the first minute of the game and were roasted by Hitmen forward Matteo Gennaro on the ensuing man advantage. \n \nDespite the setback, the Ice were strong early on and took advantage of their first two power play chances with a pair of goals from their top unit of Vince Loschiavo, Brett Davis, Colton Kroeker, Max Patterson and Dallas Hines. \n \n\u201cWe were moving the puck around well and Kroeker made some unbelievable passes,\u201d  Loschiavo said on their success with the extra man. \u201cAt the end of the day [though] you have to be [good] 5-on-5 [too].\u201d \n \nLoschiavo and Davis were the beneficiaries of the hot power play, and their two goals were enough to take the team into the second period with a 2-1 lead and feeling good. \n \nThat positivity quickly escaped the Ice however, as Davis picked up a high-sticking penalty off the opening faceoff and the Hitmen converted another power play goal, this time from Jakob Stukel. \n \nThe goal set off a chain-reaction with Luke Coleman and Andrew Fyten quickly adding to the lead and making it a 4-2 game by the midway point of the second period. \n \nWhile Pierce said that the early power play was unfortunate, he thought that the team\u2019s response to adversity in the middle frame was not at the level it needed to be. \n \n\u201cThey capitalized on their first [power play], which got us on our heels, but we responded, \u201d Pierce said. \u201cIt was a tough break, but you\u2019ve got to get over it.\u201d \n \nCalgary\u2019s Tyler Mrkonjic added another goal in the middle of the period, giving the Ice a three-goal deficit as they entered the final intermission. \n \nAn early 5-on-3 chance in the final frame gave Kootenay some life as Vince Loschiavo put in a low wrister from the point, but Calgary continued to be the better team to close out the game. \n \nGennaro added another power play goal before Beck Malenstyn and Mark Kastelic got on the scoresheet as the Hitmen finalized their blowout. \n \nA night after his first Cranbrook win, rookie Jakob Walter was torched for 7 goals on 27 shots before Payton Lee stepped in for 10 minutes of relief. While Pierce admitted it wasn\u2019t Walter\u2019s best night, he did not hold goaltending responsible for the loss. \n \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t give [Walter] much help [and] he didn\u2019t see a lot of the pucks they shot,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to take away our goalies eyes, we\u2019d better make sure we\u2019re going to block it [but] I think we had a season-low number of shot blocks today.\u201d \n \n\u201cThat was unacceptable. You\u2019re trying to help your goalie build some momentum and get in a groove, and we didn\u2019t give him [enough] help.\u201d \n \nLoschiavo, one of the team\u2019s alternate captains, put a lot of the blame for the poor performance on his own shoulders. \n \n\u201cWe looked like a different team after that first period and [had too many] turnovers,\u201d he said. \u201cMy line wasn\u2019t good at all, especially 5-on-5.\u201d \n \nAll three of the Ice\u2019s goals on Friday came on the power play, finishing the night 3/6 with the man advantage. Their penalty kill was only successful once, with the Hitmen scoring 3/4 on their own power plays. \n \n\u201c[Our] power play was good, but I didn\u2019t like the way we went through the motions late in the game,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the score is, [if] you\u2019ve got an opportunity to get out there and play in special teams, you\u2019re supposed to be a special player. \n \n\u201c[There was too much] coasting when it was 8-3, which is unacceptable [and] will be corrected.\u201d \n \nWhile both Loschiavo and Pierce acknowledge the huge hole that Fleury left, being the number one defenceman and leader of the team, neither were willing to let it be an excuse for the loss. \n \n\u201c[We were] missing [arguably] our best player and that\u2019s going to have an impact on any team,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe just aren\u2019t efficient enough [...] we looked tired, fatigued and had trouble putting passes together as the game went along.\u201d \n \nThe Ice are back in action on Tuesday night in Medicine Hat for the first of a home-and-home against the Tigers. After losing 8-1 this Tuesday to the Tigers, the team is expecting a much better effort in the series. \n \n\u201cThe last time we played them, we had a good first period,\u201d Loschiavo said on the upcoming matchup. \u201cWe have to continue that, because we can\u2019t let what happened last time, or tonight, happen again.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"\u2018Second period blues\u2019 sink Kootenay Ice against Hitmen","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V3S","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Surrey East","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Parksville Qualicum News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673425","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Parksville Qualicum News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://pqbnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203435549","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Beaufort","zipCode":"29910","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bluffton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Island Packet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1303"},"name":"Island Packet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.islandpacket.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203444408","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I was in Miami for work on election night, with colleagues from several other countries. It was a defining moment to be on American soil, especially to be so geographically close to a country the incoming president had promised to punish, and indeed, who would commence to do just that immediately. \n \nI've always had conservative friends, though more who tack left. I was raised as a conservative and until so many reached this fever pitch, polarizing hatred of each other in recent years, I could always find common ground with most people. But an electorate driven by fear and lies will never be a sound one, nor will it capitalize on the best that all individuals, and communities, have to offer regardless of political stripe. \n \nI also have many American friends, and as I sat watching the swells for a peaceful march on Washington, D.C., take shape, I knew I had to do something. I had to support friends who wanted no part of an administration that would trample women's rights, civil rights, and the environment, promote bigotry, racism, xenophobia and homophobia. \n \nI called a friend in New Hampshire and told her I was coming down to get her, and we were going to Boston to march. She asked if I had room for two more. Within an hour of saying on Twitter that I was going, a reader contacted me and said she'd knit me one of the famous pink hats. She did it the next day and I picked it up on my way. \n \nHere's the thing: I'm a rules kind of person. I made sure the press car I was driving had the requisite permission forms to take it over the border. I calculated how much money I would need and changed it up here. I had to read websites on how to go to a march because I'd never gone to one. And I got down there and was surrounded by 175,000 other people who were pretty much saying the same thing. \n \nI had some fear at the back of my brain. After the Boston Marathon bombing four years ago in this same place, I'd have to be a fool not to. There was trepidation underneath the sea of pink hats and handwritten signs, and there was concern surrounding all those strollers and children. But more importantly, there was an overwhelming sense of hope. \n \nYou've probably read reports that the marchers were a bunch of bored white housewives, but that is wrong, and unfair. Nearly 30 per cent of Boston's population is made up of immigrants; in the GTA that number is 52 per cent. When an incoming administration starts taking a bead on women and immigrants and those in the LGBT community, it is possible for citizens to feel the weight of many targets on their back. \n \nI'm not changing the world, but the world is changing me. The new U.S. administration is now also going after scientists, eliminating funding and silencing those who produce facts that get in the way of the made up nonsense that even their spokespeople can't name. \"Alternative facts\" are lies. Threatening to destroy the work done by NASA and dozens of other government agencies who deal in nonpartisan science is chilling. \n \nOur scientific community was similarly attacked by our former prime minister. To pretend we can ignore what's happening is foolish, because every decision being made down there affects us too. \n \nNot sure what I'll be wearing to the Science March, but I'll be there.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Lorraine Sommerfeld: I\u2019m not changing the world, the world is changing me","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"N1H","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Guelph Northwest","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Guelph Mercury","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660209","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Guelph Mercury","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.guelphmercury.blogs.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203445501","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They have always had a loving relationship. Mom has dementia and dad is her caregiver. He is refusing to put her into a home and his health is taking a turn. He has been able to take care of her to this point, but now it just is too much. How do I get him to let go? \n \nA: You are probably speaking of a long-standing marriage, likely of more than 50 years and your father is being a good husband to his wife. The thought of losing her or seeing deterioration in her care is so far a greater burden than being her caregiver. \n \nAt the same time, you are trying to be a supportive daughter with due concern for the well being of your father. These are challenging times and altogether too common. \n \nFrom your father's perspective, his care for your mother may be well worth the sacrifice of his own well being, even if unbearable for yourself. While you can't necessarily get him to do anything, you may be able to influence him with regard to his decisions. \n \nInfluencing starts with empathy. However, rather than empathizing about the difficulties in caring for his wife, you can empathize with him in losing her to this dreaded disease. You can also marvel at and appreciate his devotion to your mother. \n \nIn establishing an empathetic relationship, then you can discuss care options that could be consistent with his love for your mother and consistent with his expectations of her care. You can research and introduce your father to the various care options so he is well informed. The strategy is to help him improve her care without necessarily replacing him. \n \nCare options may include home-care, respite care or placement in a care facility. Your father will need to know the details of each and every option and how that enhances your mother's life and what role he can play in their ongoing relationship. He feels responsible for her well being and needs to feel useful to her. \n \nWith whichever option he may choose, he will need to be front and centre in terms of viewing the service delivery until such time as he gains confidence in the standard of care. \n \nYour local Alzheimer Society and local CCAC (Community Care Access Centre) will be among your best resources at this time.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Dad won\u2019t put mom with dementia in a care facility","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"N1H","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Guelph Northwest","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Guelph Mercury","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660209","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Guelph Mercury","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.guelphmercury.blogs.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203448372","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Apple never moved jobs offshore, it created them there. \n \n\"The Apple jobs were never here,\" Panzica said. \n \n\"The entire supply chain grew in China.\" \n \nApple benefits in Asia from a network that goes beyond subcontractors assembling smartphones, tablets or laptops. The California-based firm relies on a dense ecosystem of companies that make components and spare parts for its devices as well. \n  \nIt makes no sense to make phones here if you have to ship all the components from China \n  \nChina also offers sources of important raw materials, along with cheap, flexible and abundant labor to keep iPhone assembly lines cranking along. \n \nIt would be \"very hard to replicate\" that situation with US workers without using \"more robotics and less workforce,\" undermining the political aim of creating jobs here, according to Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay. \n \nExacerbating the challenge, \"it makes no sense to make phones here if you have to ship all the components from China,\" said technology analyst Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates. \n  \n\n   \nAn iPhone on display \nPhoto: Reuters \n  Sacrifice profit or price  \nThe MIT Technology Review in June considered several scenarios, from simply bringing assembly to the US to simultaneously shifting the manufacture of parts here. \n \nThe Review estimated the extra manufacturing cost of an iPhone 6S Plus at $30 to $100 as a result of those moves. \n \nIt is difficult to imagine that Apple would risk its status as the world's most profitable company to absorb such a hike in manufacturing costs. \n \n\"Apple will never lower its margins on its flagship product, the iPhone,\" said Ovum consumer technologies analyst Ronan de Renesse. \n \nApple is under pressure from investors to keep its high margins, and already faces slowing growth of iPhone sales. \n \nSo, would US consumers put their money where the political talk is and pay more for iPhones stamped \"Made in the USA\"? \n  \nI would be very surprised to see a major production shift to the US \n  \nNot all analysts were convinced. \n \nIt was seen as more likely that Apple would make a symbolic move to appease Washington, such as investing more in making Mac Pro computers here, or in a facility for higher-priced, limited-edition devices such as an \"anniversary edition iPhone\" to mark the handset's 10th birthday this year. \n \n\"I would be very surprised to see a major production shift to the US,\" Gold said while discussing Apple. \n  \n\n   \niPhone 7 smartphone \nPhoto: Reuters \n  Carrots or sticks?  \nBreaking the US technology star's successful business model should be out of the question for the Trump administration, and there is likely to be a compromise such as \"financial incentives,\" according to Ovum analyst de Renesse. \n \nFoxconn is already trying to get US states to woo it with grants of land, cheap energy, or tax breaks. \n \nApple could seek tax amnesty for the $200 billion or so in profits it keeps overseas in exchange for increasing local manufacturing. \n \nThe economic equation would change if Trump went on the offensive by imposing heavy customs duties on Chinese imports. \n \nGiven Apple's dependencies on partners in China, and its keen desire to gain traction in that market, Apple could find itself an early casualty in a US trade battle with Beijing. \n \nGet the latest news by signing up to our newsletter , following us on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Handhelds news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"'Made in America': An iPhone made in the US?

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n   \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n   \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n   \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n   \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n   \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n   \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n   \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n   \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n   \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n   \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n   \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n   \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n   \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n   \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n   \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n   \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n   \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n   \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n   \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n   \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n   \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n   \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n   \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n   \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"District Of Columbia","zipCode":"20005","state":"District of Columbia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Washington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"McClatchy DC","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"407110897","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1300"},"name":"McClatchy DC","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mcclatchydc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203454011","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Luxury London explores the harm our lack of shut-eye is doing us and suggests how to catch more Zzz\u2019s \n \nEveryone does it. We spend a third of our lives doing it. Margaret Thatcher claimed she only needed four hours of it. Thomas Edison declared that it was a waste of time. I\u2019m talking about sleep, of course. \n \nSnoozing plays a big part in brain development, and a \u2018bad sleep\u2019 can often lead to poor work performance. Dr Guy Meadows, clinical director of Sleep to Perform, is trying to uplift lethargic workforces by educating employers and employees about the vital role sleep play in our lives.  \n \n\u201cSleep is fundamentally important to our day-time performance. In the workplace we do a lot of high-order executive functions \u2013 communicating, recalling memories, problem solving and being focused to name a few,\u201d he says. But how does a lack of sleep affect these functions? Dr Meadows explains the science behind it.  \n \n\u201cThese processes are run by an area of your brain called the prefrontal cortex \u2013 one of the most vulnerable areas to be affected by sleep deprivation. When we experience poor sleep we encounter reduced focus and attention, our creativity is dulled, our risk of accidents increases and our ability to manage our emotions is significantly affected.\u201d \n   \nEssentially, a bad sleep equals a bad day at work. When discussing this, Dr Meadows refers to an intriguing Dutch study from 2003 entitled The Cumulative Cost of Additional Wakefulness by Hans P.A. Van Dongen PhD, which tested the cognitive performance of people who\u2019d slept for eight hours, against people that had experienced total sleep deprivation (zero hours). He then tested the cognitive performance of people who had had two weeks of six-hour sleeps. He discovered the cognitive performance of the six-hour sleeps after five nights, was equivalent to cognitive performance of the zero-sleepers after two nights.  \n \n\u201cThis highlights that partial sleep deprivation does also have a detrimental impact on us. Many of us sleep deprive ourselves in the week by sleeping for five or six hours and trying to catch up on the weekend. It doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d says Dr Meadows. So next time you tell your co-workers your Friday night plans involve \u201ccatching up on lost sleep\u201d, you\u2019re essentially telling them a lie \u2013 the bottom line is there is no real way to recoup lost sleep.  \n \nThere\u2019s no specific answer to the question \u2018how many hours of sleep do we require?\u2019 explains Dr Meadows. \u201cOur sleep need is determined by genetics and so while the average proportion of the population needs an average of seven or eight hours, there are also a small percentage of people who might need anything from a range of four to 12 \u2013  though this is an extreme range.\u201d Essentially, I\u2019m told, you know you\u2019re getting the right amount of sleep if you wake up feeling refreshed. \n \nMaryanne Taylor, sleep consultant and owner of a clinic called The Sleep Works, which specialises in developing personalised schedules, explains that \u201cthere is a myth that an adult requires eight hours of sleep for maximum functioning ability.\u201d She continues: \u201cSleep needs vary to some degree from person to person.  To determine what an individual\u2019s sleep needs are, it is important to consider both the spectrum of average sleep hours and the lifestyle of the individual.\u201d She firmly believes that there is not a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution when it comes to sleep.  \n \nTURN OFF TO SWITCH OFF  \n \nThe technology we\u2019re surrounded by could be one contributing factor to poor-quality snoozing. \u201cThe way in which we live our lives is affecting our sleep. We\u2019re not making sleep a priority in an incredibly stimulating world,\u201d says Dr Meadows.  \n \nOne of the main issues is the blue light that laptops, phones and TVs emit. The light suppresses the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps control your sleep cycle and fundamentally, blue light will trick your mind into thinking it\u2019s time to wake. Sending a late night email or checking Facebook before bed hampers melatonin production and keeps your brain in an active state.  \n \nNot all technology is bad: those of us with Apple\u2019s latest iOS 10 will have noticed the introduction of the \u2018Bedtime\u2019 app. Notify your iPhone how many hours sleep you\u2019d like to sleep and it alerts you to when you\u2019re nearing your bedtime, and wakes you with a gradual alarm.  \n   \nAs winter sets in, and most of us start to begin and end our commute in darkness, it\u2019s not just that we\u2019re psychologically more tired. \u201cSleep patterns can be affected by season changes,\u201d Taylor explains. \u201cMelatonin is affected by exposure to light and the more melatonin your body produces, the more tired you feel. Bright light slows down this production and makes us feel more awake. So we often feel more tired and sluggish during the winter and have more energy during the summer and spring.\u201d \n  \nWomen need to sleep, on average, for 20 more minutes than men  \n  \nAccording to Dr Jim Horne, a sleep science expert, women need to sleep, on average, for 20 more minutes than men \u2013 research points to female tendencies of multitasking and using more of their brain than men, leading to a greater need for sleep. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that women are getting the sleep they need.  \n \nDr Meadows tells me that in his clinic, 65-70 per cent of the people experiencing insomnia are women. \u201cThe most common reason is that females have two powerful hormones \u2013 progesterone and oestrogen \u2013 and these have powerful stimulant and hypnotic effects, so they can aid sleep but also have a higher potential to disturb sleep.\u201d  \n \nIn 2011, a survey of 6,700 people by the UK\u2019s Mental Health Foundation found that just over one third of respondents were classified as \u2018good sleepers\u2019, while more than a third were categorised as possibly having chronic insomnia. So, for the latter third, what can be done? \n \nDr Meadows\u2019 Sleep to Perform campaign aims to increase daytime productivity through a single-minded focus on improving sleep. It\u2019s helped businesses such as Unilever, P&G, PricewaterhouseCoopers and, so far, 750 traders at Lloyds Bank. How? \n \n\u201cWe have three key areas we help corporate businesses with: how to improve quality of sleep, how to lessen impact of stress on sleep and how to transition from work to home. The whole purpose is so that they can perform at their best knowing how to sleep well and manage anxiety,\u201d says Dr Meadows.  \n \n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in corporate organisations is that they find themselves awake in the middle of the night, their minds racing and they don\u2019t know how to switch off and they\u2019ll go to war and try to block it out. The problem with this is that it\u2019s like telling someone \u2018don\u2019t think about a white elephant\u2019. We teach people to do the opposite, to objectively notice the white elephant arriving, but then to let go of holding them.\u201d \n \nIn the US, more than a third of employers offer programmes addressing sleep disorders. For staff at insurance group Aetna, it pays to get a good night\u2019s sleep \u2013 literally. The group encourages its workers to sign up to a scheme that rewards them for getting at least seven hours of shut-eye per night \u2013 they could end up earning $300 (approximately £240) a year for doing so. For every 20 days an Aetna employee reports sleeping at least seven hours, he or she can earn $25. \n \nIt\u2019s with all this information to digest that I leave you with a line from the famous diary of Samuel: \u201cAnd so to bed.\u201d  \n   Share by email   \nHero image: Sleeping woman","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Sweet Dreams: Your Guide To Better Sleep","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Luxury London","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"577391915","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Luxury London","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Health"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.luxurylondon.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luxurylondon.co.uk%2F%2Farticle%2Fsweet-dreams-your-guide-to-better-sleep&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luxurylondon.co.uk%2Fimage%2Fshutterstock-400579492-7770205.jpg&description=Alarm+clock+%7C+L","https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luxurylondon.co.uk%2F%2Farticle%2Fsweet-dreams-your-guide-to-better-sleep&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luxurylondon.co.uk%2Fimage%2Fshutterstock-401782333-89637158.jpg&description=Woman+using+phon"],"sequenceId":"695203455612","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harrison","zipCode":"39507","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gulfport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6447"},"name":"Sun Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sunherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203455955","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The reports were based on a story published earlier in the day by The Nation newspaper on Saturday, January 28, 2017 in which it claimed that an unnamed Niger Delta governor lost a diverted bailout sum of $10m to a girlfriend living in the United States of America. \n \nDelta State Commissioner for Information, Patrick Ukah, last night in a statement issued in Asaba strongly condemned \u201cthe various attempts to link Delta State Governor, Sen Dr Ifeanyi Okowa with the said story.\u201d \n \nUkah said: \u201cIt is instructive to state that The Nation , quoting sources from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) reported that a serving governor from the South-South region, allegedly diverted $10M from the bailout fund for his state, without mentioning anybody\u2019s name. \n \n\u201cWe are appalled by the attempt to link Governor Okowa with the story by online media. We find it ridiculously tasteless and mischievous. This can only be part of the unrelenting campaign of calumny and the ceaseless peddling of pernicious propaganda against the person and office of the Delta State Governor. \n \n\u201cFor the record, the state government has severally in the past given account of how the bailout fund the state got from the Federal Government was used. We will not repeat ourselves here. \n \n\u201cGovernor Okowa is a responsible family man and a well respected public figure. His preoccupation has been and continues to be how to deliver on his promised S.M.A.R.T agenda to the good people of Delta State since he came to office. And he has received applause and commendations from far and near for being so focused and unrelenting in the pursuit of his vision for the state. \n \n\u201cHe will not be distracted by any form of organised and orchestrated blackmail from any quarters. And God willing, he will continue to deliver on his promises. \n \n\u201cBut we wish to sound this note of warning, that if those who are bent on carrying out their devious and dubious campaign of calumny against the governor refuse to stop this infamous trade of theirs, we reserve the right to take any action deemed appropriate to seek redress.\u201d \n \nSource News Express \n \nPosted 29/01/2017 02:02:35 AM \n \nShare on  Tweet   \n  CLASSIFIED ADS  \nLet us build the most comprehensive online database of worthy and credible Nigerians from all walks of life.

That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States.\n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission.\n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually.\n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell\n\n---\n\n9:40 p.m.\n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect.\n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced.\n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention.\n\n---\n\n7 p.m.\n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights.\n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported.\n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained.\n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes.\n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions.\n\n---\n\n1 a.m.\n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall.\n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\"\n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\"\n\n----\n\n12:20 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\"\n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\"\n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted.\n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days.\n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war.\n\n---\n\n12:10 a.m.\n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order.\n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months.\n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S.\n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes.\n\n----\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive.\n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\"\n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas.\n\n----\n\n11:20 p.m.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you.\n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\"\n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport.\n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015.\n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration.\n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S.\n\n---\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody.\n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S.\n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night.\n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released.\n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\"\n\n---\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own.\n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend.\n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia.\n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\"\n\n---\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran.\n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order.\n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\"\n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\"\n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy.\n\n---\n\n8 p.m.\n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq.\n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning.\n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides.\n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six)\n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi.\n\n---\n\n7:05 p.m.\n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\"\n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nTrump signed the order Friday.\n\n---\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.\n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.\n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.\n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.\n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.\n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell\n\n---\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants.\n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag.\n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month.\n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach.\n\n---\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months.\n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\"\n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\"\n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland.\n\n---\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel.\n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\"\n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya.\n\n---\n\n3 p.m.\n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.\n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi.\n\n---\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence.\n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\"\n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security.\n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\"\n\n---\n\n1 p.m.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones.\n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days.\n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\"\n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\"\n\n---\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision.\n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\"\n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\"\n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Richland","zipCode":"29201","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"South Carolina State","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1236"},"name":"South Carolina State","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thestate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/national/article129328759.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Latest%3a%20Source%20says%20foreign-born%20US%20residents%20can%20return&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2fnational%2farticle129328759.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2fnational%2farticle129328759.html&title=The+Latest%3a+Source+says+foreign-born+US+residents+can+return","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2fnational%2farticle129328759.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2fnational%2farticle129328759.html&description=The+Latest%3a+Source+says+foreign-born+US+residents+can+return&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mcclatchy-wires.com%2f","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/national/article129328759.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/"],"sequenceId":"695203465514","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/wire_photos/ujhc0f/picture129341514/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/Trump_74116.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again?

Last season ended with the unexpected death of Bea, the show's main character. Bea's life ended in a tragic manner when Joan \"The Freak\" Ferguson (Pamela Rabe) stabbed her repeatedly with a screwdriver. \n \nWhen Bea died, her lover and fellow inmate Allie Novak (Kate Jenkinson) was still in coma. Before the season ended, fans saw her waking up. However, she is yet to learn about Bea's death. \n \nAccording to International Business Times , it can be speculated that upon learning about Bea's death, Allie will start to reminisce about their times together as she grieves her lover's death. As Allie goes back to some of those moments, Bea is expected to appear. \n \nAside from knowing about Bea's possible appearance in the show, fans are excited to know who is going to replace Bea's top dog rank in Wentworth Penitentiary. Recent reports  are guessing that \"The Freak\" is going to take matters into her hands and control the prison, especially since she was the one who killed Bea. \n \nOn the other hand, despite producers' continuous reiteration that Bea really is dead, there are persistent reports about her possible  comeback  alive. In relation to this, there are theories that \"The Freak\" will suffer the consequences of her actions. It is speculated that season 5 will see the fall of Joan. \n \nIf Bea comes back alive, there is no doubt she will have to teach \"The Freak\" some lesson. And if Bea really is dead, the possibility that Allie will plan for revenge cannot be ruled out as well. Ultimately, it looks like \"The Freak\" has no other way to go but down. \n \nThe premiere date for \"Wentworth\" season 5 has yet to be announced.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"'Wentworth' Season 5 Spoilers: Bea Smith To Appear In Some Flashback Scenes?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Christian Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664732","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"428"},"name":"Christian Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.christianpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.ibtimes.com.au/wentworth-season-5-spoilers-danielle-cormack-appear-one-more-time-flashback-1540685","http://www.ibtimes.com.au/wentworth-season-5-spoilers-freak-inherit-beas-top-dog-post-1540719","http://www.itechpost.com/articles/61724/20161205/bea-smith-s-big-comeback-wentworth-season-5-see-joan.htm"],"sequenceId":"695203473164","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He eventually joining Genoa on loan. \n \nHowever, he has flourished under Montella since his appointment last summer, cementing a place in the Rossoneri starting eleven. \n \n\"With Inzaghi at the end I had found a bit of space. I think that if he had stayed, I would have had even more,\" Suso told Gazzetta Dello Sport \n \n\"Instead, Mihajlovic came in. He uses a trequartista in his teams and I thought that could be a good thing for me. Now I play as a winger, but originally I was a trequartista. \n \n\"But I had been out for virtually six months, so during the first days of pre-season I said to the Coach: 'If you think that I won't have chances here, I will go on loan because I need to play to get my form back. \n \n\"He said: 'No, stay calm, we will play with a trequartista and I only have you in that role.  \n \n\"He played me against Empoli at home. I was dead, I wasn't fit. My legs were not working, I felt rusty. After an hour, he took me off and I didn't play anymore from that moment. \n \n\"I trained well, maybe better than now, but I didn't play and I didn't understand why. \n \n\"There wasn't any argument. He obiously didn't like me, that's it. And given that we recently played Torino in the League and Coppa Italia in the space of a few days, I said hello to all his staff who were here at Milan, but I didn't see Mihajlovic.\" \n \nSuso then discussed his relationship with Montella, saying that though he has never had a long conversation with the former Fiorentina boss, he enjoys the style of play being implemented at Milan. \n \n\"I will confess one thing. Up until today, I have never had a long conversation with him. He has never said to me, 'I want this and that from you.' \n \n\"He explained his idea of play to the team - keep the ball and attack with courage.

The other side have brought out the big guns so we have got to match that - it doesn't come cheap. \n 'A quick buck for the developers'  \n\n \n\"People have been with us all the way through this campaign and all we want to see is this area protected for future generations.

If the group loses, a legal protection order means its costs will be limited to £5,000. \n \n\"It will just be a quick buck for the developers if it goes ahead.

She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Miki Perkins"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3130","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Blackburn","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bendigo Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169704381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"79"},"name":"Bendigo Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203475614","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:52Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/7fbc3373-3d41-4dde-80a2-4920951b021f.jpg/r1_0_727_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The pageant will also feature multiple live entertainers. \n \nAccording to Jalyn Yarbrough, pageant director, this is the first year that she knows of for the pageant to have all freshmen contestants. \n \n\"I think it's exciting,\" Yarbrough said. \"It gives them an opportunity to really get the feel of what Cameron is. I definitely feel like the Miss Black CU pageant is a part of Cameron's social life and their experience.\" \n \nThis is the first year for Yarbrough to direct the Miss Black CU pageant. She competed in the pageant in 2014 and 2015 before graduating from the university in 2016. \n \n\"I'm just so blessed that I got this opportunity to be the director,\" Yarbrough said, \"so that I can carry on that legacy of 38 years and just keep it going.\" \n \nThe winner will be chosen by a combined score of the five public segments and a private interview with the five judges. This year's winner will succeed 2016 Miss Black CU Sarae Simpson and will receive roughly $1,200 worth of financial assistance from the university's Black Student Association. Yarbrough said Miss Black CU is a face and public figure of the university and the Black Student Association. \n \nThe duties of Miss Black CU also include being involved in the community, on campus and off, and supporting her platform and educating the public on her platform. Platforms explored by this year's contestants are \"Raising Breast Cancer Awareness\"; \"Raising Awareness of Single Parent Stereotypes\"; \"Suicide Prevention\"; and \"Beautifully Different with a Loud Voice.\" \n \nThe talent portion will consist of singing, praise dancing, lyrical dance and painting. Yarbrough believes the talent portion allows the judges and audience to see a more personal side of the contestants. \n \n\"Because they're coming from their heart and their mind and their creativity and just kind of being raw with you and showing what they can do and what they're passionate for,\" Yarbrough said. \n \nNew this year for Miss Black CU is that the winning contestant will have the chance to compete in Miss Black America Coed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"New Miss Black CU to be crowned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Comanche","zipCode":"73502","state":"Oklahoma","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lawton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lawton Constitution","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668198","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"316"},"name":"Lawton Constitution","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.swoknews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203478045","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It will bring back the monthly workshops starting Saturday, and children will be able to create homemade Valentine's Day cards and gifts along with Valentine's Day themed crafts. \n \nThe workshops are for those who are old enough to hold a paintbrush, according to Schneider. Parents are asked to stay with their children for the duration of the workshop, which lasts from 10 a.m. to noon the first Saturday of each month. Schneider believes the workshop is a good time for parents to take a break from their busy lives, slow down and spend time with their children. \n \n\"It's two hours  come in, away from the hustle and bustle,\" Schneider said. \"Forget you have laundry. Forget you have to go grocery shopping or work on the car. Lose yourself in your kids and their imagination. It's so cool to watch their little minds work.\" \n \nShe also believes the workshops are a moment for children to get back to using their imaginations. \n \n\"They're kind of told what to do everyday, and it's nice for them to come and paint a tree blue and the sky purple,\" Schneider said. \"The workshop lets them use their creativity and imagination, and I think that's so important; it lets them go back to their roots and get dirty and get clay and paint on them. There's something kind of primal about it.\" \n \nSchneider does need volunteers for the monthly children's workshop. She asks volunteers to come 30 minutes before each workshop to help set up and to stay afterwards to help clean up. She also asks parents attending the workshop with their children to help clean around their children during the workshop.  \n \nSchneider, Treasurer April Weber and the council have hosted the event for four years now, and they're happy to be able to provide an outlet for children and a way for families to spend quality time together. \n \n\"I've watched these kids grow up,\" Schneider said. \"They walked in when they were 1 and now they're turning 4. It's really cool to see moms pregnant with babies and now their babies are coming in. It's a lot of fun.

They play Adelaide twice and the three teams immediately above them once. \n \nIn the weekend's only other game, Dandenong (14-6) defeated Melbourne 78-66 to initially keep top spot, a position they held until Sunday's loss.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Scott Bailey"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Narrow wins, but big WNBL prize for Sydney","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Melegari \nSouthampton Township, New Jersey \u2014 \nThe Southampton Township Committee on Jan. 17 acted on several items which were tabled at previous meetings and announced progress with a few ongoing matters of interest. \n\nA resolution authorizing a memorandum of agreement between Southampton Township and the Hampton Lakes Emergency Squad (EMS) was passed unanimously. \n\nThe resolution was previously tabled by the committee on Dec. 20. A contract between Southampton Township and the Hampton Lakes EMS expired on Dec. 31. \n\n\u201cWe have reached an agreement with the emergency squad,\u201d said Committeeman Michael Mikulski. \u201cThey will continue to provide services under the existing contract and under the existing terms until we have completed dotting the I\u2019s and crossing the T\u2019s.\u201d \n\nThe Hampton Lakes EMS continued to provide ambulance services to the township as contract negotiations continued, despite no legal requirement to do so. \n\nMikulski said he anticipated that a new contract will take effect on Feb. 1. \n\n\u201cThe last drafts I saw, I think we have probably the 99 percent solution,\u201d Mikulski said. \u201cI expect it will be completely resolved before the end of the month.\u201d \n\nThe memorandum of agreement establishes legal responsibility in the interim for Hampton Lakes EMS to provide ambulance services to the township while negotiations continue. \n\n\u201cThis just exists until we get a new contract in place,\u201d said Township Solicitor George M. Morris. \n\nIt is unclear whether the committee will pass an ordinance or resolution authorizing the township to enter into a new contract with the Hampton Lakes EMS at a special budget meeting scheduled for Jan. 31 at 6:30 p.m. Such action is required before a municipality can enter into a contract for emergency services. \n\n\u201cWe have had very good negotiations,\u201d said Kit Applegate, an attorney who represents the Hampton Lakes Emergency Squad. \u201cBoth sides have negotiated in good faith. We have had frank conversations and we are almost there. We just got to dot the I\u2019s and cross the T\u2019s. I tip my hat to the township.\u201d \n\nThe committee also unanimously passed a resolution authorizing the township engineer to prepare and file paperwork to obtain permits from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP). \n\nThe township is seeking permits from the NJ DEP so that they can begin to repair a bulkhead and embankment next to the Vincentown and Tabernacle Telephone Company building. \n\n\u201cThis is the necessary first step to get approval to do the work that we want to do,\u201d Mikulski said. \n\nThe permits are expected to cost between $10,000 and $14,000. \n\nThe building has served as the home to the Southampton Historical Society since 1976. It has been closed for over five months after a code enforcement officer condemned it for usage. \n\nTownship officials took the unusual precaution of closing the building due to the possibility that further erosion of the embankment next to the building will cause the bulkhead protecting it to fail with little or no advance notice. While the structure itself has recently been determined to be sound by a structural engineer, the erosion of the embankment is creating a precarious situation. \n\nOfficials theorize that the building could collapse into the creek should the bulkhead, which holds back the creek\u2019s water, fail. \n\nThe committee has debated several options for a permanent fix, taking into consideration that the building is within a flood plain and was damaged by floods in 2004 and 2007. \n\nThe committee appears to have narrowed their options by passing this resolution. The first option they have discussed is to raise the building and repair the bulkhead. The second option they have discussed is to only repair the bulkhead. \n\nThe committee was entertaining the possibility of moving the building to avoid bulkhead repairs and applying for permits. \n\nHowever, Mayor James F. Young, Sr. said that the bulkhead would still have to be repaired to safely conduct the move. He argued that moving the building would cost the township just as much money as making the repairs, if not more money. \n\nTownship Administrator and Clerk Kathleen D. Hoffman said that negotiations with the neighboring property owner\u2019s insurance company are continuing. \n\nThe overall project is estimated to cost a little over $100,000. \n\nThe committee also granted permission to Verizon Wireless to upgrade and enhance its wireless network in the township. A resolution providing Verizon with the authorization to conduct the upgrades and enhancements was previously tabled by the committee in December. \n\nThe mobile carrier plans to install mini-cellular antennas, known as mini-nodes, on existing utility poles. The technology is designed to fill in coverage gaps and accommodate spikes in cellular traffic. \n\nEach mini-node provides about 1,000 feet of enhanced coverage and/or capacity. In comparison, a cell tower provides miles of capacity. The mini-nodes will be placed in identified areas that would benefit the most customers. \n\nDowntown areas, developments, and sections of a street with a concentration of homes would be especially targeted for the devices. \n\nThe company has specifically targeted rural communities in the state for this technology since the existing wireless coverage is spotty. \n\nSince most of the mini-nodes would be installed on existing utility poles, the technology would not be subject to the Pinelands Commission\u2019s Comprehensive Management Plan provisions, unless new pole installation is required. \n\nWashington and Medford granted Verizon permission to install mini-nodes in December. \n\nThe township will require the company to submit a $750.00 escrow fee. The company also must provide a list of device locations to the construction office on a monthly basis. \n\nThe committee also announced that communication had improved with the New Jersey State Police (NJSP) Red Lion Barracks which provides police services to the township. \n\nDuring recent committee meetings, officials said that the township was not being notified of burglaries, could not get the commanding officer to agree to put a speed trailer on thoroughfares with speeding issues, and was having trouble arranging a meeting with the barracks leadership to discuss concerns. Young said the agency was \u201cshorthanded.\u201d \n\nDeputy Mayor Bill Raftery said that he, Young, and Hoffman met with the commanding officers of the NSJP Red Lion Barracks on Jan. 13. \n\nHe said they met for the sole purpose of requesting their help to monitor the speeding and traffic activity on New Road, Ridge Road and some sections in the middle of Main Street. \n\n\u201cWe spoke to them about putting a speed trailer up,\u201d Raftery said. \u201cI think it was a very good conversation. They were very supportive of our efforts and requests. Hopefully you folks will be able to see some presence very shortly, if not already.\u201d \n\nIn other news, the committee introduced and read an ordinance which will amend sewer service and connection fees. \n\n\u201cThis is an ordinance amending the sewer connection fees and service fees for the Village (of Vincentown) sewer system. \n\nOfficials did not provide any further details to the public during the meeting. \n\nAfter the meeting concluded, Hoffman said that the ordinance increases the fees. \n\nHoffman would not elaborate on why a fee increase was necessary. She also could not provide the proposed figures as of press time. The Pine Barrens Tribune has filed an Open Public Records Act request to review the proposed ordinance. \n\nThe committee agreed to allow the township participate in the county\u2019s aerial application of larvicides for mosquito control for 2017. \n\nThe green light was also given for the township to apply for New Jersey Department of Transportation municipal aid. \n\nThe committee would like to use the municipal aid to make improvements to Hawkins Road. \n\n\u201cIt is a heavily traveled road for school buses,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cSo, we think we have a good shot at getting it.\u201d \n\nShe said there is no guarantee that the township will be able to secure the aid. She said that the township will find out at the end of the year whether they have been given financial assistance for the road improvements. \n\nAdditionally, 11 businesses were granted trailer or truck licenses. \n\nA resolution authorizing the township to enter into a shared service agreement with Waterford Township for use of a truck was tabled. \n\nDuring public comment, multiple residents complained about a New Road auto salvage yard owned by Allied Recycling Inc. who leases the property to Modern Day Recycling. \n\nOnce again there were calls for the committee to act on their concerns about nighttime activity, speeding, flatbed trucks failing to stop at a four-way stop intersection, a pile of 25,000 scrap tires, soil contamination, and truck noise. \n\n\u201cThe day before Thanksgiving, I was out early doing some shopping,\u201d said Nancy Kolankiewicz, a resident who lives in the vicinity of New Road. \u201cI get home at around 10 or 11 in the morning and I am coming off of Route 206 and I make the right at the traffic light onto Ridge Road. I come to the stop sign and I stopped. I am going to make a right and I see this very large tow truck and it was pulling an even longer and larger RV. This thing was a monstrosity and of course it was over the yellow lines. It was as far over as it could be. It looked like the entire siding had come off the RV because the siding was actually protruding (the other lane).\u201d \n\nShe said that she believed the RV was coming from the auto salvage yard. She added that the RV was hitting trees and knocking things down. She also said the situation is not getting any better. \n\n\u201cThe road is not wide enough and I hope it is on the list of things to look at,\u201d Kolankiewicz said. \n\nResident Pat Topham said she saw the same vehicle on Route 206. \n\n\u201cHe was coming from the circle and heading down Route 206,\u201d she said. \u201cLike she said, it was huge. It looked like a can opener had opened up the side. The awning was bent in the middle. It was flapping up and down. I was two cars behind it and there was stuff flying off of it. Some things looked like cardboard and some things looked like insulation. Just before I got up to the motorcycle shop, a very large window flew off the camper.\u201d \n\nTopham provided a picture of the window laying on the highway to the committee. \n\n\u201cHe kind of pulled over a little bit and then he just kept on going,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody could get hurt.\u201d \n\nTownship officials said that the auto salvage yard owners will be making court appearances on Jan. 24 and 27. \n\nThe first appearance is scheduled to be in municipal court. The second appearance is scheduled in Superior Court Assignment Judge Ronald E. Bookbinder\u2019s courtroom. \n\n\u201cHaving some people, especially in Bookbinder\u2019s courtroom, can\u2019t hurt,\u201d Mikulski said. \n\nYoung said the committee was going to take one step at a time. \n\n\n\nA contract between Southampton Township and the Hampton Lakes EMS expired on Dec. 31. Under the terms of the contract, the township can extend the agreement for two additional one year renewal terms. However, the committee did not take that action and was without a legally binding document until Jan. 17.

This will help teachers keep a tab on daily class strength and show the percentage of attendance to help them inform the students about the shortage in advance,\u201d a senior DU official said. \nEarlier, the teachers used to manually maintain an attendance register and few colleges like Hindu, Zakir Hussain College, Miranda House and IP College for Women, used to update the attendance on their websites on a monthly-basis. \n\u201cBut after the app is launched, teachers will update the attendance on the app on a daily-basis. Attendance data is very crucial for students, especially at the time of issuance of admit cards for exams. \n\u201cStudents always come up with complaints that teachers have not maintained accurate attendance sheets,\u201d the official said. \nThis will be a centralised app for all departments and faculty members of 68 colleges affiliated to the university. \nAfter testing on a pilot basis for few years, the university last year made online the process of undergraduate admissions and also opted for digitisation of the marksheets.

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall. Vitto Brown was 0 of 2 from 3-point range and 0 of 4 overall. Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sedgwick","zipCode":"67202","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wichita","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wichita Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665895","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6865"},"name":"Wichita Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansas.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203486280","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Contents  Introduction  Types of engines  Engine Component  Working of 6 stroke engine Comparison of 6 stroke with 4 stroke engine  Advantages and disadvantages Conclusion  Reference 2  3. Engine is a device which transform one form of energy into another form. The six stroke engine \u201cUsing water\u201d was developed By Brush Crower in 2006. A six stroke engine derived its name from the fact that it is a mixture of two and four stroke engine. The six stroke engine is a type of internal combustion engine based on the four stroke engine , but its additional two stroke make it more efficient and reduce emission. Types of six stroke engines 1. Griffin six stroke engine. 2. Bajulaz six stroke engine. 3. Crower six stroke engine. 4. Velozeta six stroke engine. Six stroke engine 3  4. 4 Actual Prototype of SIX Stroke engine  5. ENGINE IC ENGINE EC ENGINE Types Of Engines IC \u2013 Internal combustion engine EC \u2013 External combustion engine 5  6.  The internal combustion is an engine in which the burning of a fuel occur in a confined space called \u201c IC ENGINE\u2019.  An external combustion engine is heat engine where an(internal) working fluid is compressed and heated by combustion of an external fuel through the engine wall or heat exchanger. 6  7. 7 Component of engine  8. 8 Alternators \u2013 it is used to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy. Camshaft \u2013 it is used to controls the opening and closing of valves. Time belt \u2013 a belt connected to both camshaft and crankshaft ensuring that they work in time with each other. Sparkplug \u2013 it is a component to initiate the combustion process in spark ignition engine and is usually located on the cylinder.  9. 9  10. Working of six stroke engine In first stroke (suction stroke)  Intake of pure air in the cylinder.  The valve is open. 10  11. Second stroke (compression stroke) Compression of pure air in the heating chamber. Both valves are closed 11  12. Third stroke (power stroke) In this stroke the piston moves downward and the power transmitted from piston to wheel. Both valves are closed. 12  13. Fourth stroke (exhaust stroke) Exhaust of the combustion gases. The exhaust valve is open. 13  14. Fifth stroke (secondary power stroke) 14 In this stage water is injected by an Injector in the form of fine droplets and the water converted into steam. Both valves are closed.  15. Sixth stroke (secondary exhaust stroke) At this stage water is injected by an Injector in the form of fine droplets. Exhaust valve open. 15  16. Comparison Of Six Stroke Engine With Four Stroke Engine 16 In otto cylce ,there are two adiabatic processes 1- Adiabatic compression 2- Adiabatic expansion And One constant volume heat Addition process and one constant  17. 17t The dual cycle consist of the following operations- 1- Adiabatic Compression 2- Addition of heat at constant volume 3- Addition of heat at constant pressure 4- Adiabatic expansion 5- ejection of heat at constant volume The heat is added partly at constant volume and partly at constant pressure; The advantage of which is that more time is available to fuel for combustion.  18. 18 parameters Four stroke engine Six stroke engine Strokes It consist a 4 strokes . It consist a 6 strokes . ( add 2 additional strokes) Thermal efficiency Low high Weight Low High Fuel consumptions High Low Power Low High Example- Car ,buses etc. Motor boat, high cost bikes(ex \u2013Ducati).  19. Advantages of six stroke engine  The thermal efficiency reaching 40-50%.  Fuel consumption reduce by more than 40%.  Reduction of chemical, noise and thermal pollution.  Increased torque and power output. 19  20. Disadvantage of six stroke Engine  Complex Head Design  Complex Cam Design For Exhaust (Due to two exhaust strokes).  Heavier Engine (Due to combustion engine).  Manufacturing of essential part is difficult. Weight increases. 20  21. conclusion  In a six stroke engine the fuel consumption is less. Better fuel economy compared with a conventional four-stroke design. Torque is increase by 35% and efficiency increased by the same. It reduces the weight and complexity of the engines head by as much as 50%. The concept of Six Stroke Engine seems to be rather eco-friendly and low fuel consuming which can fulfill the needs of near future. 21  22.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sedgwick","zipCode":"67202","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wichita","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wichita Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665895","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6865"},"name":"Wichita Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansas.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203486651","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a \u2018caliphate\u2019. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\u201d Trump said in his executive order. \n\u201cFor those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\u201d he said. \nThe plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group. \nTrump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. \n\u201cIf ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\u201d he warned. \n\u201cWe know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability. It continues to radicalise our own citizens, and its attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount. The US must take decisive action to defeat ISIS,\u201d Trump said. \nThe terror group is responsible for the violent murder of American citizens in the Middle East, including the beheading of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig, as well as the death of Kayla Mueller, the executive order notes, the executive order said. \nIn addition, ISIS has inspired attacks in the United States, including the December 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, and the June 2016 attack in Orlando, Florida, it said. \n\u201cISIS is complicit in a number of terrorist attacks on our allies in which Americans have been wounded or killed, such as the November 2015 attack in Paris, France, the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, the July 2016 attack in Nice, France, and the December 2016 attack in Berlin, Germany,\u201d said the executive order. \nThe plan seeks public diplomacy, information operations, and cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimise ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology; identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and policies to empower coalition partners to fight ISIS and its affiliates; and mechanisms to cut off or seize ISIS\u2019s financial support, including financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources.

In the current operate gas turbine blade was constructed with panels of FGM.The blade has been constructed and observed with poly panels which performs fine results on raising the panels of the blade. The material property changes every panel due to its own body property. FGM is produced by Nickel and Zircon and Carbon fiber is exercised to decrease the amplitude of vibration of the blade. FGM usually applied panel by panel, a trial has been made to observe the cause of temperature and lured stresses upon the turbine blade. The mechanical features of the blade are rubbed in the thickness direction by according to a displacement and stress is gained employing FEM and the thermal survey inspects the order of the temperature flow which has been developed as a result of thermal filling. An effort is also arranged to advise the perfect material for a turbine blade by considering the results gained for this materials to accepted material. Key Words: FGM, FEM, Temperature effect, gas turbine blade, lured stress. I.INTRODUCTION Compound materials have been appliance in the aerospace industry over the past four decades. Still, their wider usage is confined by the long delay and very high cost of certification checking. Compound materials will decline under high operating circumstances through a phenomenon called delamination (division of fibres from the matrix). This can occur in extreme temperature usage. The main components of structural compounds are the profits and the matrix. The profits, which are more perfect and stand, are broken up in a considerably less perfect and stand matrix material. The perfection and firmness of such compounds are, therefore, organised by the perfect and firmness of component fibers. The matrix also allocates the load when there is not much difference between the perfection and firmness features of profits and matrices. A.Functionally Graded Material (FGM) Functionally Graded Material (FGM) relates to a class of latest material classified by variation in features as the side changes. The whole features of FGM are single and different from any of the solo material that starts it. There is a bulky of applications for FGM and it is predicted to raise as the cost of material guiding and fabrication plans are declined by producing these plans. In this article, an outline of fabrication phenomenon, a stream of appliance, some latest research studies and the commitment to focus more research attempt on developing the most assuring FGM fabrication method (solid freeform(SFF)) is defined. The main principle is to enlarge fracture toughness, increase in perfection because ceramics only are fragile in nature.Fragileness is a great limitation for any structural appliance. These are created by joining both metals and ceramics for exercise in high temperature applications. B. Gas Turbine Blade A blade can be presented as the intermediate of transfer of power from the gases to the turbine rotor. A turbine blade is the single part which handles up the turbine section of a gas turbine. A blade can be stated as the stream of transfer of energy from the gases to the turbine rotor. The blades are responsible for detaching energy fromthe extreme temperature, very high pressure gas developed by the combustor. The turbine blades are usually the limiting constituent of gas turbines. To live in this arduous environment, turbine blades frequently apply exotic materials such as super alloys and various methods of cooling like internal air channels, boundary layer cooling, and thermal barrier coatings. C. Fibre The compound features are certainly involved by the selection of fibres. Fibers give the main bulk of profits that are employed in organising structural compounds. There are glass and aramid fibres, carbon and the compound is regularly titled by the reinforced fibre for example CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer).They have some different features which include price handle one more suitable selection then the other for different uses. For strengthening uses carbon fibres are the most suitable selection and will hence be aimed on in the following. D. Carbon fibre Carbon fibres have an extreme schedules of elasticity, 201\u2013 800 GPA. The certain elongation is 0.3 \u2013 2.5 % where the lower elongation correlates to the higher firmness and vice versa. Carbon fibres withstand fatigue outstandingly, do not force corrode and do not present any creep or relaxation when compared to low relaxation high tensile pre-stressing steel Strands. The means of carbon fibres, such as high firmness, small weight, big chemical resistance and low thermal expansion, maintain them very famous in military, aerospace civil engineering and motorsports, along with other heavy competition sports. Therefore they are reasonably high cost when compared to same fibres, such as plastic fibres or glass fibres.  2.

Fibre Carbon fibres formulated from Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) which are turbostratic, whereas carbon fibres formulated from mesosphere pitch are graphitic after heat operation at temperatures exceeding 2300 °C. Turbostratic carbon fibres ready to have high tensile force, whereas heat-treated mesosphere-pitch-formulated carbon fibres have extreme firmness or resistance under load and very high thermal conductivity. II.PROBLEM PROCEDURE A.ASSIGNMENT APPROACH Constructing of the turbine blade is a difficulty case. For constructing a gas turbine blade, essentially the very existing blade parameter is tested and confirmed for drawing the blade. The blade parameters are stated as shown in table I. TABLE I. BLADE PARAMETERS a These parameters are utilized in CATIA V5 software in order to produce the draw of turbine blade in sequential manner. Every parameter is given as input at the places wanted. Fig. 2. Gas turbine blade picture Fig. 3 Single blade picture B. Material Properties The material functions of Functionally Graded Material (FGM) is evaluated using Rule of Mixtures. Since, FGM is a class of compound which changes through its volume fractional part or side. The Volume Fraction equation is shown by VM + VC = 1 (1) Where, VM \u2013 Volume fraction of metallic VC \u2013 Volume fraction of ceramic The Elastic features of FGM can be evaluated by using Power Law P (Z) = {(PC - PM) * (VC) n} + PM VC = {(1/2) + (z/h)} n (2) Where as PM \u2013 Material property of Metallic PM \u2013 Material property of Ceramic z\u2013 Thickness Dimension h - Thickness n \u2013 Volume fraction exponent (e) (≥ 0) C.Observation of Gas Turbine Observation of Gas Turbine Blade is done by using commercial FEA software package. The material functionalities were used in agreed to the determination which is taken to thermal-stress simulation so the view of this observation is to be the entire combusted gas with extreme pressure and temperature will strike the turbine blade. So the main role thing is here is the blade cooling and its strength as a result of high pressure so that I take different panel with carbon zircon and compound mixture The Gas Turbine blade has gone through structural and thermal survey. The observation is first managed for the panel plate in order to get the difficulties that could erase during the panel observation. Since, the present project is to be created to get the equivalence material features.  3.

Gas turbine blade Meshed The blade was noted after the complete geometrical operation. The next point is meshing the model with process is called as pre-processing. The geometry which involves the curves, points and surface families\u2019 generations, clust setting, material statement. The tetrahedron meshing has been appliance in this geometry by applying patch conforming method. The whole number of cell and nodes are 415050 and 620609 respectively. The proximity level should be small size faces and shorten sides. Here the gas turbine blade was increasing and trailing side, the both of sides was fined in according to catch the side and faces of 0.001 mm tolerance of the mesh E. Calculation For 2 panels, E (Z) = {(EC - EM) * (VC) n} + EM (3) Let n = 1, VC = {(1/2) + (z/h)} n (4) VC = 1 (5) VM = 1 - VC (6) Therefore, VM = 0 (7) E1 = {(151\u2013 105.7) * (1) n} + 105.7 (8) E1 = 151 GPa Similarly, E2 = 105.7 GPa TABLE II.

So as the thermal phenomenon and convection regions stand as per the derivation. The mechanical phenomenon stands as the pressure force of the liquid. Fig. 6. Contour of Thermal Phenomenon Fig. 7. Contour of Mechanical Phenomenon III.RESULT AND ANALYSIS The analysis is considered on the gas temperature of 619°c, with non-panelled, 1, 3 and 4 panels. On analysing the von-misses stresses happened on a non-panelled gas turbine blade with material properties of zircon alone, the maximum von- misses stress that has happened on it 2.09 x E11 pa. The blade has been analysed without executing the material properties of carbon fibre. In temperature condition, the heat flux of zircon is detected to be 1.45 x E07 w/m2 and the temperature and the deformation was 0.036781 m. The 2 panelled blade with the material properties of both nickel and zircon, the maximum von-misses stresses that has gotten on it 1.32 x E11 pa. The blade has been reviewed without employing the material properties of carbon fibre. In temperature condition, the heat flux of zircon is measured to be 7.37 x E07 w/m 2 and the temperature and deformation was 0.055643 m. The 3 panelled blade with the material properties of both nickel and zircon with compounding the property grated material, has way of standing the maximum von-misses stresses of about 1.30 x E11 pa. The blade has been discussed without using the material properties of carbon fibre. .In temperature condition, the heat flux of zircon is detected to be 8.61 x E07 w/m 2 and the temperature and deformation was 0.05361 m. The 4 panelled blade with the material properties of both nickel and zircon with compounding the functionally grated material, has way of standing the maximum von-misses stresses of about 1.36 x E11 pa. The blade has been discussed without using the material properties of carbon fibre. .In temperature condition, the heat flux of zircon is detected to be 7.60 x E07 w/m 2 and the temperature and deformation was 0.051 m. When property grated materials are appliance, better capacity of withstanding thermal and mechanical phenomenon presented, and it can see the theoretical evidence in the panel analysis. For poly-panel blade, the materials are manufactured of 2 completely distinct things. On one side, the zircon can stop the heat from producing too fast into the metal, which means it can also keep heat inside the blade and won\u2019t them out. This is useful feature for engine arechitecture.On the other side the nickel is of excellent elastic capacity, which will guide to offset the stress produced by the body forces from touching things. Therefore, the compound materials has the two roles that counts in engine architecture. Fig. 8. Constant condition of temperature effect in turbine blade Fig. 9.

From these studies the researchers have specified in many articles concluding that FGM is best appropriate scope for extremely high temperature conditions. I have been introduced this vision in the Gas Turbine blade on the dependence of FGM features from the study of several papers. From the high temperature conditions, it is proved that FGM in gas turbine blade can withstand in high temperature conditions and it will absorb and decline at constant level. Functionally graded materials are developed materials having superior features of heat resistance, appropriation to be practiced at extreme temperature conditions and having appropriate mechanical characteristics at the same time. FGMs can be implemented with FIBRE to occur robust materials that have modern thermal and mechanical characteristics making them highly related to the aerospace vehicles and other structures using developed temperature resistance and mechanical capacity. FGM is the material process which has possibilities for later level of approaches and appliances. Only a few experimental analysis are implemented in this field and there have been some practical implementations so far, even though natural examples are so many. It is predicted that with later studies the application of FGM may be further developed. REFERENCES [1] S.E. Moussavi Torshizi, S.M. Yadavar Nikravesh, A.

International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, January -2017 www.ijdets.com Page 35 M.Harish, C.K.Vinod 1, 2 PG Scholar, Department of Mechanical Engineering, CBIT, Hyderabad, Telangona, India Abstract- The present technique in automotive industry is to change their Sedan cars into Hatch back or vice versa, instead of manufacturing an entire new car, thereby decreasing the manufacture and cost of the production. The major goal of this operation is to do external navigation visual of Sedan and Hatch Back car models containing similar front view by applying computational technique on 1:40 reduced scaled car model and dimensions are 0.4m (wide, high) and 1.6m length respectively. The Sedan car is measured down model of the existing car, while the Hatch Back car model is newly manufactured such that both the car models have similar front view. The 3D computational technique was maintained by using CATIA V6 as the modelling technique, ICEM CFD as the pre-processor (meshing process), and ANSYS FLUENT as the calculator and ANSYS CFD- POST as the post processor. Computational outcomes support that Sedan car is more streamlined and nagivagated efficiently as compared to that of newly manufactured Hatch Back car model. Though both car models have similar front view, Hatch back car model has nearly 3.6 percentage more Drag Co-Efficient as compared to that of Sedan car model. This can be defined as Hatch Back car which considers Sedan car by putting front area same can develop the Drag Co-Efficient of 3.6 percentage.. Key Words: Sedan version, Hatch Back version, drag co- efficient, CFD I.INTRODUCTION External navigation design of car models has suggested automotive industry in decreasing the drag force operation on the cars over the years. Even though drag force operating on the car bases on various variables such as drag co-efficient, projected front view, velocity at which the car is running and the environmental condition in which the car operates [density variable], it\u2019s only the drag co-efficient times the front view of the car that can be cared [1]. So, manufacturing of the cars help in declining the drag co-efficient of the cars, thereby decline the drag force. In modern days , automotive industries have implemented a new configure of changing their most successful sedan car version into hatch back version and vice versa, where both the cars have similar front view. This donates a sense of relaxation for external navigation design engineers, where they keep at most pressure in developing fuel efficient and economical cars. The automotive companies can invest their money in manufacturing the rear part of the car instead of manufacturing an entire new car where the cost would be more and also the external navigation design engineers will not concentrate on the aesthetics of whole car, as it is sufficient to concentrate only at the rear part, thereby declining manufacture time and price. Also need of CFD equipment and high end featured computers has suggested automotive industries in declining the investment price on cars and also to convert maximum usage of modelling and design equipment to get essential corrections in the geometry of the cars, thereby getting actual cars will be secure and infection free before the actual production. Bhagirathi zala et al (2013) [2] in their research compared 1:21 decreased measure Sedan and Hatch Back car versions by practical analysis. The research presented that Sedan car version was more navigation as compared to Square Back car version and had a drag coefficient value 43% lesser than the Hatch Back car version. The computational task maintained by having Bijlani et al [2013] [3] also supports that Sedan car version is more navigation than Hatch back car version by 43%. It is stated from the literature studies that most of the road vehicle external navigation study work has been concentrated either on Sedan cars or bluff equipment such as bus and only a few works has been noticed on the external navigation studies of Hatch Back cars. Though there are some works worked on the external navigation comparison of Sedan and Hatch Back cars [3, 5], there is no work noticed on the direct comparison of Sedan and Hatch Back cars containing similar front view by computational technique. Since each car designing company has its own design language and it\u2019s not a good idea to compare two different points of cars i.e., Sedan and Hatch Back cars of various make (company) to come into a conclusion that which among them is better, unless any of the geometric variable is put study state (in the current work front view is put constant). II. COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUE Computational technique was managed for both 1:40 measured down Sedan and Hatch Back car versions containing similar front view. Sedan car version was made to see geometrically same to commercially existing Sedan Car, while Hatch Back car version was newly analysed by correcting the 2-D background of the similar Sedan car version. Both the car versions were versioned such that they contain similar front view but different only at the rear state i.e., one is versioned as Sedan car version and other as the Hatch Back car version. Geometrical version was generated using CATIA V5 modelling software, while the  2. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, January -2017 www.ijdets.com Page 36 meshing process of computational range was managed in ICEM CFD software using blocking phenomenon. ANSYS Fluent was applied to calculate the flow problems and CFD POST was applied as post processing software. A. Geometrical Technique Geometric techniques were modelled using CATIA V5 R22 modelling software. For available research only2-D background available car was appliance to generate the 3-D geometrical technique. Side mirrors and other joints were not taken to make the simulation case easy. For existing work, there are four different types of car versions were modelled. First is the Hatch Back car version and the Sedan car version was divided into 3 types of same measure i.e., Sedan with tyres, Sedan without tyres fixed to body, Sedan with gap between body and tyres, because it was need to know what percentage of drag force raises due to the account of tyres and gap between tyres and body. So, if the drag force gap is less, then the car models without tyres can be applied in the future computation methods in order to decline unnecessary meshing process and computational time, on the other case if the gap is large than either the car model tyres fixed or the car model with gap between body and tyres can be selected based up on the accuracy and computational resources required. The Sedan car model has the measurements 0.066m wide, 0.050m high and 0.176m long, while Hatch Back car version has the measurements 0.066m wide, 0.050m high and 0.155m long. Fig. 1: Sedan Car Version without Tyres Fig. 2: Sedan Car Model With Tyres Fixed Fig. 3: Sedan Car Version with Variation between Body and Tyres Fig. 4: Hatch Back Car Version B. Meshing Process Meshing process of the computation range was exercised entirely by applying blocking in ICE phenomenon CFD meshing phenomenon. Since, only 2d background of the Sedan and Hatch Back car versions were selected for research in the existing work, 2d planer mesh was produced initially in the XY plane catching the 2d background of the car versions which was later on changed to 3d mesh just by considering the mesh blocks in the Z direction. 1. Frame work Frame work was managed for 1:40 measured Sedan car version without tyres in a 0.4m wide, 0.4m high and 1.6m long wind tunnel range. Initially course mesh was produced for the car version with nearly 2.6million nodes, later on the mesh was corrected by raising the node count to 1.6 times the past mesh. The similar problem was made to work i.e. at the similar velocity but with distinct mesh size. In the final mesh, node count was restricted to 15.9 million as there were no great changes in drag co-efficient outcomes. Table 1: Difference of Drag Co-Efficient With Number of Nodes  3. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, January -2017 www.ijdets.com Page 37 Frame work study for the existing work was managed at 21m/s and a total of six different grid resolutions were applied. Case A has the coarsest resolution and case G has the existing grid resolution. Grid refinement was worked only at some finite identification around the car version where steep pressure gradients were predicted. Table 1 shows the difference of drag co-efficient with raise in the node count. It can be clearly showed that there are no reasonable changes in drag co-efficient after 9.7 million node count. Hence there was no specific point in selecting existing grid at the price of huge computational systems for slight raise in accuracy. So, the mesh with 9.7 million node count was discussed for the present computational technique. All the meshes produced were concentrated such that the low angle of the grid would lie above 22 degree and the determinant would lie above 0.6. The measurements of the computational range was depended on the real wind tunnel test part measurements (0.4m wide, 0.4m high and 1.6m long) and the car versions were kept in the computational wind tunnel range certainly similar to that was mounted in the wind tunnel test section with blockage ratio of 4% [5], as it was need to simulate actual wind tunnel situations (a) (b) Fig. 5: Sedan Without Tyres: (a) Mesh Range; (b) External Mesh (a) (b) Fig. 6: Sedan with Tyres Fixed: (a) Mesh Range; (b) External Mesh (a) (b) Fig. 7: Sedan with Variation between Body and Tyres: (a) Mesh Range; (b) External Mesh  4.

Calculation Computational car external navigation problem was calculated by applying ANSYS FLUENT as the calculator for both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions at 4 different velocities (15m/s, 20m/s, 25m/s, 30m/s). Table 2: Calculator Arrangement Fig. 9: Correlation of Plot for Sedan Car Version Firstly problem was taken to operate for 7000 repetitions at specific velocity. Since there were no great alterations in the dust values above 2000 repetitions, all the other flow difficulties were made to operate for 2000 repetitions, thereby declining computational time. Fig. 9 represents the Correlation plot for Sedan car version at 25 m/s. Correlation absolute approach for measured dust was fixed to 10-6. As the measured dust for all the variables are less than 10-6 it can be said that solution is correlated. D. Post Processing All the post processing work was made by using CFD POST software pattern. Different contour plots such as velocity contours, pressure contour etc were pointed at different velocities for both Sedan and Hatch Back car version. All the computational technique was managed in Hp Z800 workstation containing the following point, Processors: 18x Intel Xeon 5570 2.9GHz, Memory: 32GB DDR2 RAM, Chipset: Intel 5570, Graphics: ATI FirePro 5700 Graphics. III. RESULTS AND REVIEWS (b) Fig. 10: Pressure Distributions: (a) Sedan car (b) Hatch Back car Simulative external navigation technique was focussed on Sedan and Hatch Back car versions having same front view in a trial to know their external navigation attitude at distinct velocities. It is (a) Table 3: Corner Conditions  5. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, January -2017 www.ijdets.com Page 39 proved from the Fig. 10 (a) and Fig. 10 (b) that extreme pressure (stagnation plot) acts at the front bumper and this pressure raises with raise in velocity for both the cars versions. At the meeting point of hood and front windshield the car models practices positive pressure due to the interference harmed by the front windshield. The car models, while rest of the areas of car versions feels negative pressure. Also it can be presented that pressure working over the car models is less where the car structure is streamlined and is more at another areas. Due to obstruct change in body and generation of adverse pressure parameter, flow division takes place at the mid part of rear wind shield. Due to this flow division, production of eddies and vortices takes place at the rear wind shield of both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions which can be clearly preented in the Fig. 11 (b) and Fig .12 (b). Slight flow re-fix takes place at the boot region in case of sedan car model. (b) Fig. 11: Sedan Car version: (a) Pressure Contour; (b) streamlines It is identified that Pressure co-efficient plot trend remains constant at all the velocities for both the car models as shown in the Fig. 13 (a) and (b). So, it can be finalised that pressure co- efficient variation along the middle line of the car models is unique of velocity [9]. Also it can be identified that variation of pressure co-efficient along the middle line of the car model follows same trend as that of the pressure, with pressure co- efficient being maximum at the front bumper with a value near to 1.0 and minimum on the roof. Almost unique value of CP is attained at every port on the car model for different velocity domains. (a) (b) Fig. 12: Hatch Back Car Version: (a) Pressure Contour; (b) Streamlines It is proved from the fig. 14 that drag force raises with raise in velocity over the whole velocity valuates for both the car models, while drag co-efficient declines slightly with raise in Reynolds number. It is identified that Hatch Back car model has around 3.6 % more drag force and drag co-efficient than the Sedan car model though both the car models have similar front view. Hatch Back car model feels more drag force as compared to Sedan car model due to actual fact that air flow over the Hatch Back car model separates much earlier and the negative pressure area left behind the Hatch Back car model due to flow division is more as compared to that of Sedan car model. It is interested to notice that drag co-efficient declines with raise in velocity because of delay in flow division as the speed raises in both the car versions. (a)  6. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, January -2017 www.ijdets.com Page 40 (a) (b) Fig. 13: Division of CP: (a) Sedan (b) Hatch Back From the above computational comparison technique it is fine that body change only at the rear end can generate a drag co- efficient division up to 3.6%. This can be finalised in the other case, correlation of Hatch Back car into a Sedan car can develop the drag co-efficient by 3.6%.Though the drag development is quite small in magnitudes, but this small development can make huge influence on external navigation efficiency of cars. In general this development in drag co-efficient of the Sedan car suggests in getting the mileage almost equal to that of Hatch Back car though weight of Sedan car is more as compared to Hatch Back cars. Fig. 14: Variation of Fd with Velocity Fig. 15: Division of CD with Velocity As it was important to understand the change in force and drag co-efficient attained with and without the respect of tyres and variation between body and tyres, computational technique was managed for different classifications of Sedan car models i.e. Sedan car without tyres, Sedan car with tyres fixed, Sedan car with gap between body and tyres. Table 4 represents the division in drag force and drag co-efficient attained for different cases of Sedan car versions at 10m/s. It can be identified that Sedan car model with tyres fixed has 9% more drag co-efficient as compared to Sedan car without tyres, while the difference in drag coefficient between Sedan car without tyres and Sedan car with gap between body and tyres is 16%. So it is fine that there is a greater basis of drag co-efficient on exterior background of the car model. But on the other case it can be identified that computational time necessary for Sedan car with gap between tyres and body is around 250 hrs while its only 40 hrs for Sedan car without tyres for each velocity. So it can be concluded that the combination of type of car models for technique on the computational resources existing and the accuracy range needed. Table 4: Drag Division for different types of Sedan car version  7. International Journal of Development in Engineering, Technology and Science (IJDETS) Volume: 01, Issue: 01, January -2017 www.ijdets.com Page 41 IV. CONCLUSION 1. Computational technique of Sedan and Hatch Back car models support that Sedan car model has less drag co- efficient and drag force over the whole velocity range as compared to that of Hatch Back car model so it can be concluded that Sedan car model is more streamlined and external navigation efficient compared to Hatch Back car version. 2. For both Sedan and Hatch Back car versions drag force raises with raise in velocity, while drag co-efficient declines slightly with raise in Reynolds number. 3. Computational technique supports that, as the speed raises the difference in drag force between Sedan and Hatch Back car models also raises. 4. Computational technique is maintained on Sedan without tyres, Sedan with tyres fixed to body and Sedan with tyre and gap between the body states that there is greater dependency on the exterior background of the car models. Hence it advised taking the entire background of the car for future external navigation studies based on the computational and practical resources available.

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \nAirport arrests \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Missoula","zipCode":"59802","state":"Montana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Missoula","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KECI.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169687287","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"KECI.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nbcmontana.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203497152","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.lakana.com/bmg-global-us-east-1/photo/2017/01/29/No%20Muslim%20Ban%20protest_5747322_ver1.0.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Bulldogs claim seven team state titles \u2014 tied for ninth best in state history  \u2014 with each championship coming in a span of 11 years starting in 1984. \n \nBut the last of those titles came in 1994, when Tom Wagner was a senior at Brighton. Wagner, now in his 10th season as the Bulldogs\u2019 coach, finished his prep career with three team titles and two individual titles. Few programs in the history of CHSAA have been as dominant as the Bulldogs during that time. And few prep wrestlers ever get to experience winning one individual state title, much less two. \n \nSo when Wagner accepted the job in the fall of 2006, he made it his mission to bring back the magic, and since then the Bulldogs earned one top-five team finish at state in 2007. \n \nBut this winter Brighton appears as dangerous as it has been since Wagner donned a red and white singlet. The Bulldogs took second at the prestigious Top of the Rockies tournament Jan. 21, placing only behind defending champion Pomona, and have a number of individuals capable of making deep state tournament pushes at the Pepsi Center next month. \n Related Articles January 18, 2017   Q&A: Inside the mind of two-time defending state champion Jacob Greenwood   January 5, 2017   Q&A: Grandview wrestling coach Ryan Budd talks Wolves\u2019 continued ascension   December 31, 2016   5 things to watch the rest of the Colorado prep sports winter season    \n\u201cThere\u2019s huge tradition here that we\u2019re trying to build back up,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIt starts with getting numbers out, which we\u2019ve been able to do because we had over 50 kids out for the team this season. It\u2019s also about the approach. Tom Cortez was my coach, and he\u2019s in the CHSAA Hall of Fame, so we brought his rough, hard style of wrestling back to the room, especially lately because we\u2019ve had a group of kids that can handle that intensity.\u201d \n \nThe Bulldogs followed last weekend\u2019s showing with another impressive performance, dominating their own Brighton Invitational on Saturday, beating out other top-tier 5A teams in Cherokee Trail and Coronado. Such consistency throughout the month of January has been because of the team\u2019s depth. The Bulldogs boast talented wrestlers in their lower, middle and upper weights. \n \nJohnny Sanchez (106), Jarron Martinez (113), Nathan Baca (152), Jeremiah Ellerd (160), Tarron Adams (182), Ian Helwick (220) and Tanner Aitken (285) \u2014 all of whom placed at Top of the Rockies \u2014 give Brighton balance, as does the return of Orlando Gallegos from injury at 138. \n \n\u201cOur team is getting better each week, which is always good leading into this time of year,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cTaking second at the Top of the Rockies was a bit of a surprise to us. We figured we\u2019d fall in the top five somewhere, so that was better than expected, for sure. And that raises our confidence going into the final stretch of the regular season.\u201d \n \nWagner believes a number of his guys will be in contention for an individual title, but acknowledges there\u2019s still room to grow over the next few weeks. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better on our feet, because we\u2019re just a little bit gun-shy on taking shots right now,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIf we get better on our feet and get a little more aggressive, we\u2019ll be in good shape. We\u2019re wrestling good off the bottom, we\u2019re wrestling tough on top and we\u2019re a pinning team. When we compete with that mind-set, we\u2019re tough to stop.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kyle Newman"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Brighton wrestling could bring back the Bulldogs\u2019 glory days under alum Tom Wagner","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Denver","zipCode":"80202","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Denver","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Denver Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661509","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"35315"},"name":"Denver Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.denverpost.com","publisher":"MediaNews Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203497341","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1kn8396-copy.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Nowadays multi-tasking is an absolute pre-requisite in anything you do, anywhere you go. A simple example would be that of the smartphone. 10-12 years ago, you had a mobile phone to make calls, an iPod to carry your music around and a camera to click pictures. The smartphone does it all and how. Something similar was brewing in the minds of the boffins at Eicher Polaris Pvt Ltd. and the result of that brainwave was the Eicher Polaris Multix. The Multix is a 3-in-1 vehicle, which can comfortably seat 5 people, carry up to 20 sacks of flour, couldn't be bothered less by bad roads and can double up as a generator as well, (Yep! It can, thanks to the optional 'X-Port' attachment that can generate up to 3 kW of electricity). \n (Eicher Polaris Multix- In action)  \nOur test vehicle was a bright yellow, which more than made up for the lack of sunshine on that day. The design is fairly simple, with the plastic body panels are mounted on a steel tubular frame, in the shape of a breadbox with a cargo bay. It looks like a really small pick-up truck. The looks are rather cute and the Multix definitely stands out when on the road. Yes! The Multix is road legal. At least the BS IV compliant variants are. \n (With the X-Port attachment, the Multix can generate up to 3 kW of electricity)  \nThe Multix is powered by a locally sourced 510cc single-cylinder Greaves diesel engine which churns out 9.8 bhp@3,000rpm and 27 Nm@1,400-2,200rpm. The engine is mated to a 4-speed manual transmission. The claimed efficiency is an astonishing 28.45 kmpl. Now, once you start up the engine, there is the familiar clatter of a diesel engine which hits you right away but cabin itself is vibe-free and the NVH levels are not deafening either. \n (Eicher Polaris Multix- Rear badge) \nAs you engage the first gear and press the throttle, you get the surge of the torque right away. This little machine was meant to pull load and the torquey motor suggests that it is more than capable. The Multix was designed to amble around at decent speeds of 35-55 kmph rather than clipping it on the road. The power is delivered to the rear wheels in a smooth manner, which makes driving the Multix, a good experience. Thanks to the tight dimensions, the Multix has a turning radius of less than 4 metres and handles decently enough. \n   \n(Eicher Polaris Multix- In action)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kingshuk Dutta"},"topics":[],"title":"Eicher Polaris Multix First Drive","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"NDTV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"633"},"name":"NDTV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ndtv.com","publisher":"New Delhi Television"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203497988","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The six-wheeled, knee-high robots from startup Starship Technologies are part of a new wave of automated systems taking aim at the \"last mile\" delivery of goods to consumers. \nStarship is launching a pilot project of robotic deliveries of parcels, groceries and prepared foods in early February in the US capital Washington, with a similar test taking place in Redwood City, California. \nThe startup, created by two of the founders of Skype, Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, has already begun testing in several European cities as part of an effort to bring new efficiencies to local delivery. \nThe goal is to enable delivery within a radius of two miles (three kilometers) within 15-30 minutes of an order, for $1 or less, with the autonomous robots traveling on sidewalks and alerting consumers of their arrival via smartphone app. \n\nStarship spokesman Henry Harris-Burland said the founders were looking to \"disrupt\" an industry which had seen little efficiency improvement from new technology. \n\n \n\"We're trying to solve real social and economic problems,\" Harris-Burland said during a demonstration of the delivery bots in Washington. \n\"This will take cars and vans off the road. We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\" \n\nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships. \n\nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others. \n\nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues. \n\nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks. \n\n\"We don't see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\" Harris-Burland said. \n\nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland. \n\nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \"customers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\" and collect the goods at the door. \n\n- Mapping sidewalks - \n\nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers. \n\nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots. \n\nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector. \n\nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. \n\nStarship says one of its strong points is its \"visual localization\" technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets. \n\n\"We can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\" Harris-Burland said. \n\n\"A lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\" \n\nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \"99 percent autonomous,\" according to the spokesman. \n\n\"We want a human being able to oversee the robot's journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\" he said. \n\nHarris-Burland said the company's tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism. \n\nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \"to the nearest inch,\" he said. \n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Pizza, Eggs, Milk To Be Delivered By Six-Wheeled, Knee-High Robots","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"NDTV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"633"},"name":"NDTV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ndtv.com","publisher":"New Delhi Television"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203498168","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tyson told The Associated Press on Saturday that Carolyn Donham broke her long public silence in an interview with him in 2008. His book, \u201cThe Blood of Emmett Till,\u201d comes out next week. \n \n\u201cShe told me that \u2018Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him,'\u201d said Tyson, a Duke University research scholar whose previous books include \u201cBlood Done Sign My Name\u201d and \u201cRadio Free Dixie.\u201d \n \nEmmett Till was a 14-year-old black tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman, then known as Carolyn Bryant. \n Related Articles January 29, 2017   Trump says making products in the U.S. is \u2018going to be cheaper\u2019; economists disagree   January 29, 2017   Is Trump keeping his economic promises?

During the trial, Bryant said that he had grabbed her, and, in profane terms, bragged about his history with white woman. The jury was not present when she testified. \n \nDonham\u2019s then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, were acquitted by the all-white jury. Both men, who later told Look magazine they did murder Till, have since died. Milam\u2019s widow, Juanita Milam, would later tell the FBI she believed that Carolyn Bryant had fabricated her story. Juanita Milam died in 2014. The Justice Department re-examined the case a decade ago, but no one was indicted as a murderer or an accomplice. \n \nOn Saturday, the maker of a documentary on Till said he had long been sure that Bryant\u2019s story was false. \n \n\u201cHis mother had mentioned that Emmett had a speech impediment and that the things Bryant claimed he was saying he could not have said easily,\u201d said Keith Beauchamp, whose \u201cThe Untold Story of Emmett Till\u201d came out in 2005. \n \nTyson said that he spoke with Donham after her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, contacted him. Bryant had read \u201cBlood Done Sign My Name,\u201d about a racist murder during his childhood in Oxford, North Carolina, and invited Tyson to meet with her and Donham. \n \nTyson said he and Donham had two conversations, both lasting 2-3 hours, and that he planned at the time to place the material in the archives at the University of North Carolina. Asked why he waited so long to publicize his findings, he responded that historians think in different terms than do journalists. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in what speaks to the ages than in what is the latest media thing,\u201d he said. \n \nHe added that he wasn\u2019t sure whether Donham knew about the book. He said he had fallen out of touch with the family and that when he last spoke with Bryant, a few years ago, she said Donham was in poor health. \n \nTill was a fun-loving teenager from Chicago visiting the Mississippi Delta and helping out on his great-uncle Mose Wright\u2019s farm. On Aug. 24, 1955, Till and some other kids drove to a local store, Bryant\u2019s, for refreshments. At Bryant\u2019s, some of the kids stayed on the porch, watching a game of checkers, while the others filed inside to buy bubble gum and sodas. Carolyn Bryant, the 21-year-old wife of proprietor Roy Bryant, was behind the counter. \n \nAccounts of what happened next differ. \n \nMrs. Bryant claimed Emmett bragged about dating white women up north. She said he grabbed her and asked her, \u201cHow about a date, baby?\u201d Simeon Wright, his cousin, heard none of this. But there is no doubt about what he heard when they left the store, he told the AP in 2005. \n \nStanding on the front porch, Emmett let out a wolf whistle. \n \nCarolyn Donham\u2019s whereabouts have long been a mystery, but North Carolina voter rolls list a Carolyn Holloway Donham. Holloway is her maiden name. \n \nThe address is for a green, split-level home in Raleigh at the mouth of a neat cul-de-sac just two turns off a busy four-lane thoroughfare. The well-tended house has burnt-orange shutters and a front-facing brick chimney decorated with a large metal sunburst. Orange flags emblazed with the word \u201cGoogle\u201d dot the lawn. \n \nA woman, who appeared to be of late middle age, and a small barking dog appeared at the front door. When a reporter asked if this was the Bryant family home, the woman replied, \u201cYes.\u201d \n \nWhen asked if Carolyn Donham was at home, the woman replied, \u201cShe\u2019s not available.\u201d \n \nAt first, she refused to accept a business card, but relented after hearing about the upcoming book. \n \nThe Emmett Till Legacy Foundation has shared news reports about the book on Instagram and asked if Donham would have the \u201cdecency and courage\u201d to speak with Till\u2019s relatives. \n \n___ \n \nAP National Writer Allen Breed contributed to this report from North Carolina","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Key Emmett Till witness gave false testimony, historian says","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Denver","zipCode":"80202","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Denver","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Denver Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661509","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"35315"},"name":"Denver Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.denverpost.com","publisher":"MediaNews Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203498813","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130615__20130616_A6_ND16TRAYVONp1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The approach was in contrast to the attitude taken by a key member of the 2013 tour who was privately dreading spending the next seven weeks on the road.\n\nGilchrist spoke to several of Australia's Test squad and backroom staff, including coach Darren Lehmann and batting coach Graeme Hick, when the side was in Perth recently for the one-day international against Pakistan. He told them \"attitude is all important\" for the seven-week tour.\n\n\"I was very much a follower and believer of most things Steve Waugh was talking to us about. I took that very much on board and tried to do that as much as possible, still do now. I find it a fascinating country,\" Gilchrist, who has business interests in India, told Fairfax Media.\n\n\"It's a country that weighs you down, too. You have highs and lows, it's an emotional roller-coaster, on the field and off the field.\n\n\"You've got to find a way to escape from it \u2013 if it's in your hotel room, but you don't want to become a prisoner to your hotel room, you have to get out there.\n\n\"It's [attitude] going to be a huge percentage of what's required. The ingredients to success is a positive attitude, not just positive like you have to use your feet and go after the spinner but everything.\"\n\nGilchrist said Waugh, in a bid to keep morale high, told the players at the start of the tour \"attitudes are contagious, is yours worth catching?\"\n\n\"From that, he extended it, saying this will be a 'no whinge tour',\" Gilchrist said. \"Forever we've come to India and we're beaten before we get here. We're whinging about the food, the conditions, the umpiring and the hotel room, the flights. We weren't allow to whinge, pretty much. It was amazing.\n\n\"It's a great question you can ask yourself every day: how you think is how you feel and that's how you're going to act, is yours worth catching? And that really helped. We didn't get the chocolates on that tour but it was a strong foundation to what lay ahead.\"\n\nAustralia's players were also given a mid-tour break between Tests in 2004, which allowed them to spend time in Singapore and the Maldives with family and partners.

Both the leaders have come together for the first time since the Congress and the Samajwadi Party reached a conclusion on their pre-poll alliance with an aim to bag over 300 of the state's 403 Assembly seats. Dimple Yadav, wife of the Chief Minister and a Samajwadi Party lawmaker, is expected to attend the press conference. Later, Mr Yadav and Mr Gandhi will be on the road for a mega \"Rath Yatra\" which is scheduled to begin at 2 pm. The road show will cover a distance of 6 kilometres beginning from the city's GPO Park near the Mahatma Gandhi statue and will end at Ghantaghar. Posters of the joint election rally surround the venue which reads \"UP koh yeh saath pasand hai (UP likes this tie-up). Uttar Pradesh will vote in seven phases, results of which will be declared on March 11. \nHere are the live highlights of Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi's joint campaign: \n \n \nRahul Gandhi:  In PM Modi's words, this is 3Ps. This alliance is about progress, prosperity and peace.  It is against PM Modi's politics.  Akhilesh (Yadav) and I have a personal as well as political relationship.

Cycle and Hand is a great combination.  Rahul (Gandhi) and I are like the two wheels of the same cycle.  We were together in the Lok Sabha, we know each other. Now we are glad that we have to work together.  There was a mention of 3P.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203512313","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fresno","zipCode":"93786","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fresno","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fresno Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3053"},"name":"Fresno Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fresnobee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203517725","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Champions Barcelona, in third, visit Real Betis on Sunday, while second-placed Sevilla travel to Espanyol. \n \n\"We leave here with a point which is more than we deserved given how we played. It was a bad game from our point of view and Alaves were better than us in every aspect, especially in intensity,\" Simeone told reporters. \n \n\"It was not a good performance and we have to try and improve so we can do better in our next game (against Barcelona).\" \n \nEarlier on Saturday, Villarreal picked up their first win in seven games in all competitions by beating basement club Granada 2-0 at home with goals from Bruno Soriano and Alvaro Gonzalez either side of halftime to tighten their grip on sixth place. \n \nEibar got over their King's Cup exit to Atletico by beating Deportivo La Coruna 3-1 to go ninth, while Celta Vigo followed up their conquest of Real Madrid in the Cup by winning 2-0 at Leganes to provisionally go seventh. \n \nGranada returned to the bottom of the league following Osasuna's 1-1 draw at home to Malaga on Friday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lacklustre Atletico held at Alaves","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Bangladesh Daily Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665687","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"132"},"name":"Bangladesh Daily Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thedailystar.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203523830","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_1/public/feature/images/atl_2.jpg?itok=X84M38_T"}],"video":[]}}

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203528494","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And Mischa because he played a game against Andy Murray that made many wonder if serve volley was back.\n\nIn Melbourne the courts and balls were faster. So Ivo Karlovic set a new Australian Open record for most aces in a match (75 against Horacio Zabellas). Games were taking less time than Rafa takes picking at his undies.\n\nTHE EFFIN' COMEBACK\n\nEff me if she didn't f'n make the f'n semis. FFS. Lucic-Baroni delivered the most candid on court post-match interview making her first quarter final in twenty years.\n\nAsked how she persisted for so long against so many obstacles she replied: \"Eff everything and everybody whoever tells you you can't do it. Just show up and win in your heart.\"\n\nShe then won her next match and this time tearfully hinted more at the back story for why the woman dubbed the next Steffi Graf had not realised that potential for 20 years.\n\nTWEET TWEET\n\nRoger does everything the best, even tweets. Federer tweeted a video of his new boy band \u2013 him, Gregor Dimitrov and Tommy Haas - singing \"How to say I'm Sorry\".\n\nALL ADVICE WELCOME, NOT HEEDED \n\nIf losing after imploding on the court wasn't enough Mark Philippoussis giving career advice on how to right his career has to be Nick Kyrgios' penny drop moment.\n\nHis meltdown loss to Andreas Seppi came after being up two sets to one and a break. Afterwards he admitted, finally, that hey being the only player in the top 100 without a coach might not be the smartest move.\n\nWHO ARE YOU WEARING?\n\nEven Daria 'Dasha' Gavrilova did a double take when she appeared on court against Timea Bacsinszky wearing identical outfits.\n\n\"It's a bit weird, but what can we do?,\" she said.\n\nIt sent social media buzzing in the way only the truly irrelevant can and was only outdone by Mirka Federer's jumper choice - a pink and green Gucci number with the words L'aveugle par amour, (\"blind love\", or \"blinded by love\") written on it. Big in central europe but not so pleasing to tennis fans it seems.\n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT?\"\n\nThings got testy on court between bustling Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka who is ordinarily as deadpan as a fondue bowl.\n\nTsonga muttered about Wawrinka giving him greasy looks.\n\n\"I looked at you when? Did I look at you at all? It's a tennis match. You've got to calm down, relax a bit.\" Wawrinka protested quite reasonably.\n\n\"There's no worries,\" Tsonga said. But plainly there is.\n\nThe pair both live in Switzerland and had been close but things went awry a few years ago after Stan's first slam when Tsonga was quoted in L'Equipe saying \"If Stan can win a slam, then I deserve one too\". And with that we bid adieu to Australian Open 2017. Welcome back next year when Pat Rafter and Pete Sampras are favourites to play in the final on a green court.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michael Gleeson"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The hits and misses of the tournament","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"6004","state":"Western Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"East Perth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"WA Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"WA Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.watoday.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203533900","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n \nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n \nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n \nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n___ \n \n9:40 p.m. \n \nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n \nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n \nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n \nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n \n___ \n \n7 p.m. \n \nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n \nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n \nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n \nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n \nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n \n___ \n \n1 a.m. \n \nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n \n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n \nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n \n____ \n \n12:20 a.m. \n \nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n \nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n \nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n \nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n \nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \n___ \n \n12:10 a.m. \n \nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n \nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n \nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n \nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n \nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n \n____ \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n \nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n \nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n \n____ \n \n11:20 p.m. \n \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n \nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n \nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n \nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n \nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n \nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n \n___ \n \n10:20 p.m. \n \nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n \nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n \nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n \nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \n___ \n \n9:50 p.m. \n \nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n \n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n \nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n \n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n \n___ \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n \nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n \nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n \nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n \nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n \n___ \n \n8 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n \nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n \nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n \nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n___ \n \n7:05 p.m. \n \nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n \nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n \nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nTrump signed the order Friday. \n \n___ \n \n6:40 p.m. \n \nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n \nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n \nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n \nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n \nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n___ \n \n6:35 p.m. \n \nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n \n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n \nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n \nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n \n___ \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n \nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n \nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n \nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n \nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n \n___ \n \n5:15 p.m. \n \nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n \nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n \nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n \n___ \n \n3 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n \nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n___ \n \n2:45 p.m. \n \nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n \nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n \nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n \nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n \n___ \n \n1 p.m. \n \nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n \nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n \nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n \nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n \n___ \n \n12:30 p.m. \n \nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n \nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bibb","zipCode":"31201","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Macon","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macon Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659292","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"56"},"name":"Macon Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macon.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203547214","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is particularly troubling since all of our neighboring states have basically come out of the recession but New Mexico hasn\u2019t.\u201d \n \nRobert Rhatigan, who heads the University of New Mexico\u2019s geospatial population studies program at the university\u2019s Bureau of Business and Economic Research, said the exodus is historic. \n \n\u201cPeople are leaving this state en masse and at a rate that has never been seen before,\u201d he said. \n \nIt is a relatively new phenomenon. \n \nFrom 1980 to 1990, New Mexico\u2019s population grew by 16.3 percent. From 1990 until 2000, the increase was 20.1 percent. From 2000 until 2010, New Mexico\u2019s population grew by 13.1 percent. \n \nThen the Great Recession and anemic recovery slammed on the brakes. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nA spokesman for Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, said reversing the outward tide will take economic diversification and less reliance on federal assistance in the state. \n \n\u201cThe fact is our state is way too reliant on federal dollars \u2013 has been for over a century,\u201d said Michael Lonergan, the governor\u2019s spokesman. \u201cBecause of that, not only did we get hit with the national recession, but we took a second blow with federal budget cuts (commonly referred to as sequestration) and a dysfunctional Washington. That put us behind almost every state. To make problems worse, we just saw one of the steepest crashes in the oil and gas industry \u2013 another sector we\u2019ve been reliant on for decades. \n \nLonergan said the governor has championed tax cuts and job training, adding, \u201cWe can no longer rely on Washington congressional leadership. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever that we continue to grow our private sector and help small businesses grow.\u201d \n \nSen. Tom Udall, a Democrat, said early childhood education, improved health care and economic diversification are critical to attracting \u2013 and keeping \u2013 New Mexico residents. He said President Donald Trump\u2019s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act could drive even more population loss. \n \n\u201cThe loss of health care coverage and jobs could very well send New Mexico into another recession, sending even more people out of state,\u201d Udall said. \u201cNew Mexico is a beautiful state, and its people are strong, and we can turn this trend around if we agree that our goal is to invest in our state and work together to build it up.\u201d \n \nSen. Martin Heinrich, also a Democrat, is scheduled to give a speech to the New Mexico Legislature on Monday that will focus, at least partly, on the problem. \n \nThere is a silver lining, according to UNM\u2019s Rhatigan, who predicted that the out-migration is slowing and could soon stop. \n \n\u201cThey (New Mexicans) haven\u2019t stopped leaving yet, but they will stop by the end of the decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have roots here. Whenever you see an out-migration from a place due to a depressed economy, the movement only lasts two to three years because the people who remain are tied to the land and aren\u2019t going anywhere. The people who are going to leave have left.\u201d \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nTwo ways to change \n \nThere are two ways a state\u2019s population can change: the difference between the number of births and deaths, and the difference between the number of people moving into the state versus out of the state. \n \nAccording to the Census Bureau, New Mexico added 59,585 people due to natural growth (births versus deaths) from 2010 to 2016. During the same time period, however, 37,780 more people left the state than moved in, resulting in a total population increase estimated at only about 21,000. \n \nThe resulting 1 percent rate of growth puts New Mexico at the other end of the spectrum from its neighbors. \n \n\u201cColorado, Texas and Utah are growing at a 10 times faster rate than us,\u201d Sanderoff said. \n \nAs if this data weren\u2019t troubling enough, a 2015 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that more than seven out of 10 babies born in New Mexico were born to mothers reliant on Medicaid, the state and federally funded health insurance program for the poor. \n \n\u201cThe vast majority of New Mexico\u2019s children are born into low-income households and receive health care through Medicaid,\u201d Sanderoff said. \u201cThis creates an extra strain on our social services in New Mexico, and there is a correlation between poverty and educational attainment levels. That also creates additional challenges for our public schools.\u201d \n \nNew Mexico also remains stubbornly at the wrong end of several quality-of-life indicators. WalletHub, a personal finance site, recently ranked all 50 states in terms of best and worst places to raise a child. New Mexico ranked last. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nThe study analyzed health and safety, education and child care, affordability, socioeconomics and \u201cfamily fun.\u201d \n \nOut of those five categories, New Mexico ranked second-worst for both education and child care, and socioeconomics; it was the worst state for affordability. Asked what New Mexico could do to improve its reputation as a place to raise a family, WalletHub analyst Jill Gonzalez, based in Washington, D.C., said boosting the state\u2019s educational climate would help. \n \n\u201cNew Mexico could certainly take measures to improve its public high school graduation rate, which is currently the second-lowest in the country, at just 69 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cAttracting new businesses would also help, as the state\u2019s unemployment stands at the fourth-highest, at 6.6 percent. \n \n\u201cMore well-paying jobs could also help reduce the percentage of residents living below the poverty line,\u201d she added. \n \nNew Mexico\u2019s poverty rate is 16 percent, the second-highest rate in the country. \n \nWallet Hub also ranked New Mexico the seventh-worst state in which to retire, making it difficult to attract well-off retirees who could help stimulate the economy. \n \nRep. Ben Ray Luján, a Democrat who represents northern New Mexico\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, said rural New Mexico is hurting from a lack of infrastructure investment. \n \n\u201cI have repeatedly heard from small communities across northern New Mexico that a lack of infrastructure and investment in rural areas has hurt our state,\u201d Luján told the Journal . \u201cNeighboring states have focused on high-speed internet access, job training and education and other priorities specifically designed to attract businesses and create jobs. For New Mexico to succeed, we need to work together to address the challenge of providing the investments we need, cultivating innovation and entrepreneurship, and providing education and training opportunities for our people.\u201d \n \nYouthful departures \n \nSanderoff said Albuquerque-based Research & Polling\u2019s own surveys indicate that younger adults and shorter-term residents are more likely to consider leaving New Mexico than others. Also, those who are not satisfied with their quality of life in the state are more likely to leave than those who are. But nothing factors into the population drain as much as jobs, he said. \n \n\u201cNew Mexico has numerous assets that are cherished by many Americans, including our great climate, culture, food, mountains and wilderness areas,\u201d Sanderoff said. \u201cBut we need our economy and our jobs to grow. We want our children, after they graduate from college, to stay in New Mexico, and that isn\u2019t happening as much as it should.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Exodus: NM\u2019s population stagnant as people leave in unprecedented numbers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87109","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Albuquerque Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660875","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3746"},"name":"Albuquerque Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abqjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203548593","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

GST, which will subsume central and state levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT, is scheduled to be rolled out from July 1. The tax slabs decided for the GST are 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent and taking service tax closer to one of the slabs is a logical move in the Budget, tax experts said. \n \nTax experts say, Jaitley, who had in his previous budget hiked service tax rate by 0.5 per cent to 15 per cent, may raise the levy by at least one percentage point to 16 per cent. Some others feel there could be different service tax rates with a lower 12 per cent for basic services and a higher 18 per cent for the rest. \n \nAlso, a higher service tax for April-June will help the government garner more revenue to meet expenses on schemes and programmes it may be planning to contain the impact of demonetisation. A service tax rate closer to the GST rate will also help consumers avoid a greater price shock when the new national sales tax is rolled out. While service tax until now is a central levy, it will be equally split between the Centre and states under the new GST regime. \n \nMost services, except essential ones like primary healthcare and basic education, will be covered by GST. Service tax was budgeted to provide Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2016-17, more than 14 per cent of the Centre's total tax revenues of Rs 16.30 lakh crore. \n \nThis will be the third time that Jaitley will raise service tax rate. Service tax from June 1, 2015 was hiked from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent. A 0.5 per cent Swachh Bharat Cess was levied on all services, taking the total incidence of service tax to 14.5 per cent from November 15, 2015. In the last Budget, he imposed a Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 0.5 per cent on all taxable services to take the levy to 15 per cent. \n \nPTI","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"FM may hike service tax to 16-18% in Budget","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Oneindia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"54"},"name":"Oneindia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oneindia.in/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.oneindia.com/topic/arun-jaitley","http://www.oneindia.com/topic/budget"],"sequenceId":"695203564540","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:10:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.oneindia.com/img/2016/08/11-1449846232-arun-jaitley-06-1470507571.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter.\n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States.\n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission.\n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually.\n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell\n\n---\n\n9:40 p.m.\n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect.\n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced.\n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention.\n\n---\n\n7 p.m.\n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights.\n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported.\n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained.\n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes.\n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions.\n\n---\n\n1 a.m.\n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall.\n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\"\n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\"\n\n----\n\n12:20 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\"\n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\"\n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted.\n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days.\n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war.\n\n---\n\n12:10 a.m.\n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order.\n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months.\n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S.\n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes.\n\n----\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive.\n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\"\n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas.\n\n----\n\n11:20 p.m.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you.\n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\"\n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport.\n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015.\n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration.\n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S.\n\n---\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody.\n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S.\n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night.\n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released.\n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\"\n\n---\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own.\n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend.\n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia.\n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\"\n\n---\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran.\n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order.\n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\"\n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\"\n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy.\n\n---\n\n8 p.m.\n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq.\n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning.\n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides.\n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six)\n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi.\n\n---\n\n7:05 p.m.\n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\"\n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nTrump signed the order Friday.\n\n---\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.\n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.\n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.\n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.\n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.\n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell\n\n---\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants.\n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag.\n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month.\n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach.\n\n---\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months.\n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\"\n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\"\n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland.\n\n---\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel.\n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\"\n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya.\n\n---\n\n3 p.m.\n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.\n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi.\n\n---\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence.\n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\"\n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security.\n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\"\n\n---\n\n1 p.m.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones.\n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days.\n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\"\n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\"\n\n---\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision.\n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\"\n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\"\n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98506","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Olympian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658445","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"962"},"name":"The Olympian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theolympian.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.theolympian.com/news/nation-world/article129328759.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Latest%3a%20Official%20says%20ruling%20will%20not%20affect%20travel%20ban&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2farticle129328759.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2farticle129328759.html&title=The+Latest%3a+Official+says+ruling+will+not+affect+travel+ban","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2farticle129328759.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theolympian.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2farticle129328759.html&description=The+Latest%3a+Official+says+ruling+will+not+affect+travel+ban&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mcclatchy-wires.com%2fwire_phot","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.theolympian.com/news/nation-world/article129328759.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/"],"sequenceId":"695203572483","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/wire_photos/ujhc0f/picture129341514/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/Trump_74116.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

And that means a lot of switching from one to the other on the set. \n   \n\u201cI think we go back and forth sometimes four different times,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be Chip for two hours. I\u2019ll be Dale for three hours. I\u2019ll be Chip for six hours and then Dale again for the last three. \n   \n\u201cYeah, we do that on the same day. It\u2019s a lot of changes back and forth.\u201d \n   \nIn working on the show, which is now in its second season (10 p.m. Thursdays on FX), he has developed a good sense of how to differentiate between the two characters. \n   \n\u201cNot to sound too actory, but it\u2019s one of those things where you do know that Dale would never say that, or you do know that Chip would never say that,\u201d Galifianakis said. \u201cThe denominator in the two of them is that they have the same mother and they look alike, but they are opposite identical twin brothers. So yeah, they are really easy to play.\u201d \n   \nHe said that the flamboyant Dale is \u201ca lot easier to play because he talks,\u201d as opposed to the more introspective, somber Chip. \n   \n\u201cThe biggest trick is because we shoot them out of order,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we can be doing episode six, and two hours later we go back to episode two.

And in this meadow there lived a Snowlygaster. He was as big as a house, as high as a house, as long as a house, and as wide as a house. Never was there another animal as big as the Snowlygaster. \n\nHe had two heads! One like a horse's head with soft brown eyes and a flowing white mane. One like a dragon's head with flashing blue eyes and covered with green scales. This head breathed fire from its nose and mouth. No animal was ever kinder than the Snowlygaster's horse head. And none was ever more ferocious than the green dragon head. \n\nNow the Snowlygaster had eight legs, four like a horse's legs, and four like a dragon's legs. When he drew up his dragon legs and ran on his horse's legs, he could go faster than the wind. But when he drew up his horse's legs and stood on his dragon legs, the wind stopped. The earth held its breath. So powerful was the Snowlygaster on his dragon legs that he could lick any beast that lived then, or lives now, or ever will live! \n\nAbout the Author: \nBorn in 1924 at her grandmother's house in Chico, California, Donna Tisdale, her parents, and her two sisters lived in a wilderness logging town in Feather River Canyon, California. She enjoys being a part of Zonta International, a wonderful service club. \n\nThe Snowlygaster is a 92-page paperback with a retail price of $34.00. The ISBN is 978-1-4809-1994-5.

But never had she had a weekend quite like the last one. \n \nKaren Chen, a 17-year-old, 4-foot-11 sprite from Fremont who trains under Gambill at Riverside Icetown, stunned the figure skating community by swiping the Ladies Senior gold at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas City. \n \nThe next night, Vincent Zhou, a 16-year-old from Palo Alto via Icetown who won the national junior title three years ago as a 13-year-old, finished second in the Men\u2019s Senior competition to Nathan Chen, no relation to Karen. \n \nOne more level crossed off. It may have been just a matter of time. \n \n\u201cIt is a building process,\u201d said Gambill. \u201cI guess that just means we\u2019re on the right track. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because now I\u2019ve had every national champion: Juvenile boy and girl, intermediate boy and girl, novice boy and girl, junior boy and girl, and now senior girl. Karen is my first senior champion, so that makes it special, that elusive senior title. And Vincent was very close.\u201d \n \nWhich would make her, um, an overnight success? \n \n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m an up-and-coming coach.\u201d \n \nGambill, a Redlands resident who declined to state her age but acknowledged her skaters now give her anniversary cards on her birthday \u2014 anniversaries of turning 39, get it? \u2014 grew up in the Sacramento area and was a good enough skater at 14 to leave home to train, much as her pupils now do. \n \nShe began coaching in Stockton 30 years ago. \n \n\u201cThe Oak Park Ice Arena,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I moved down to Southern California, and had two kids and started coaching down here. My son (Matt) is now 27, so it was 27 years ago that I started down here.\u201d \n \nHer first teaching gig in Southern California was in Palm Desert, at a long, skinny rink in the middle of the Town Center Mall \u2014 \u201ccalled a hot dog rink,\u201d she recalled. Her pupils there included Yorba Linda\u2019s Sandy Rucker and Indio\u2019s Dennis Phan; both went on to win age group national championships, Phan in 2003 and Rucker in 2005. \n \nShe later began commuting from Redlands to Anaheim three times a week to teach on a bigger ice surface, and also used the Ice Castle international training center in Lake Arrowhead when it was still open. \n \n \nAnd then Icetown opened, in 1997, an easier commute with no need to navigate mountain roads. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. \n \nThe accolades have accumulated over the years. Gambill was named the USOC Developmental Coach of the Year in 2005 \u2014 an honor that encompasses all sports \u2014 and has been similarly honored by U.S. Figure Skating and the Professional Skaters Association in 2005, 2012 and 2013. \n \nBut it\u2019s about her pupils, as it should be. She has coached world or national medalists Richard Dornbush, Shotaro Omori, Tyler Pierce and Caroline Zhang. \n \nFour of her skaters will be competing at either the world championships or world junior championships this year. Chen and Brendan Kerry of Australia will compete in the 2017 World Championships March 29-April 2 in Helsinki, Finland (and both will also compete in the Four Continents competition Feb. 15 in Gangneung, Korea, the site of next year\u2019s Olympic competition). \n \nMeanwhile, Zhou and Yarrick Paniot of the Ukraine will compete in the World Junior Championships beginning March 15 in Tapiei City, Taiwan. Zhou will also be the first alternate for the U.S. at the Worlds should there be an injury. \n \n\u201cI like it when they come in young and I can build them back up again,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun to get some of the older ones. Yaro (Paniot) just came in a couple of weeks ago. He\u2019s super talented, so I\u2019m very excited to see what I can do with him as well.\u201d \n \nShe has around 20 skaters total, and her preference is to have everyone on the ice together. She barks orders \u2014 her own description \u2014 and, along with assistant coach Ryan Berning, gives technical guidance. She doesn\u2019t discourage the idea among her skaters that she has eyes in the back of her head, a fiction that works as long as she can see their reflections in the Plexiglas. \n \nAnd she listens as well as instructs. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with her for three years now, and I feel like I really do love her as a coach,\u201d Chen said. \u201cShe can be strict, but she\u2019s definitely very understanding as well. She listens to my opinion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s always been something I struggled with in my interaction with my coach, but I feel like I\u2019m getting better. Sometimes if I\u2019m having a bad day or my knee\u2019s bothering me or something, it\u2019s hard for me to speak up and tell her, because I feel like I want to give my 100 percent in training and I don\u2019t want to let this affect anything ... (but) she\u2019s let me know this: It\u2019s important that if I\u2019m not feeling 100 percent today I need to let her know, so she can make adjustments to my training and it\u2019ll be beneficial for us both.\u201d \n \nChen is one of many skaters who have relocated from elsewhere specifically to train under Gambill. Her mother, Hsiu-Hui Tseng, is with her and her younger brother Jeffrey, an ice dancer, in Southern California during the week while her husband, Chih-Hsiu Chen, has stayed in the Bay Area. \n \n\u201cI like the way she teaches kids,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cSometimes you need to be strict. (But) she\u2019s a coach you can communicate with.

Only later did a White House official, responding to a question, acknowledge that sanctions were not among the topics the two leaders discussed. \n\nIn the first week of his presidency, Trump has been noncommittal on lifting sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in response to U.S. findings of interference by Russia in the election. Sanctions by the U.S. and its allies were in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and other actions in the Baltic region. \n\nBoth descriptions of the call focused on the positive aspects of a new American leader engaging with the Russian president. In a brief statement, the White House said the discussion was \"a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\" \n\nThe two leaders discussed \"a range in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria,\" the White House statement said, using an acronym for the militant group. \n\nThe White House official who spoke after the statement was issued said Putin brought up several times that Islamic terrorism was a \"common foe\" for the U.S. and Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose details of the call by name and insisted on anonymity. \n\nAddressing topics not mentioned in the White House statement, the Kremlin said that the two leaders discussed the importance of \"restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries.\" \n\nThe Kremlin also said that Putin and Trump spoke in particular about international issues, including the fight against terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran's nuclear program, the situation on the Korean peninsula and the Ukraine crisis. \n\nMoscow has applauded Trump's promises to rebuild U.S.-Russian relations, which have been pushed to their worst level since the Cold War by the Ukraine crisis, war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in U.S. elections. \n\nTrump signed a presidential memorandum on the plan to defeat the Islamic State group Saturday, including in it the possibility of teaming up with \"new coalition partners,\" suggesting that pairing up with Russia on counterterrorism issues wasn't off the table. \n\nWhen asked by reporters about sanctions on Friday, Trump responded: \"We'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that.\" \n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine, drawing widespread condemnation in Europe and the United States. In response, sanctions were implemented against sectors of Russia's economy, including financial services, energy, mining and defense. The Obama administration also sanctioned people in Putin's inner circle. \n\nShortly before leaving office, Obama also ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds in the United States and expelled 35 diplomats that he said were really spies. These sanctions followed an assessment by U.S. intelligence that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump. \n\nTrump's tempered approach to U.S.-Russia relations has already raised concern among several European allies who believe keeping Russia in check is essential to regional security. Domestically, some Republican lawmakers have warned against easing sanctions and pledged to put them into law. \n\nTrump also placed calls Saturday to French President Francois Hollande, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Officials say Trump, Putin avoided topic of sanctions","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mecklenburg","zipCode":"28202","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Charlotte Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659924","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3293"},"name":"Charlotte Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.charlotteobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203592656","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth. \n\nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n\nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n\nREAD MORE: * * Gifford: Wellington Sevens lacks stars \"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n\n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n\nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n\nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n\n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n\nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n\n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n\nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. Ad Feedback \"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n\n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n\nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n\nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their dominant win in Wellington.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sydney or the bush for NZ","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Manawatu Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677392","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Manawatu Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203594337","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1485676834/331/17272331.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

At the time, Grand-Craft was owned by Richard Sligh. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve never built a 28-foot double upswept, but if you give me a year I\u2019ll build you one,\u201d Sligh told Widder. \n \nThe boat was hand-built from Honduran mahogany by Grand-Craft Boats in Holland, Michigan. \n \n\u201cThese are all built by hand, one piece of wood at a time,\u201d Jeff Cavanagh, current owner of Grand-Craft, is reported as saying. \n \nGrand-Craft Boats supplied Widder with monthly progress reports/photographs of the boat being constructed throughout the year. \n \n\u201cAs far as I know, our boat is a \u2018one off\u2019 and they never did build another 28-foot triple cockpit,\u201d Widder said. \n \nThe steering wheel is a vintage 1930s Banjo Wheel from an original boat. There is also an old vintage brass fire extinguisher onboard. \n \n\u201cRanging in price from $120,000 to $1.5 million, Grand-Craft boats have been sold to celebrities such as Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez, Tim Allen and Kid Rock,\u201d The Holland Sentinel reports . \n \nWhy a replica: Mark Widder\u2019s appreciation for wooden boats came from his upbringing. He grew up with an uncle who was a boat owner and a father who was always building something out of wood. His father\u2019s jobs early in his career involved working as a wood pattern maker for aerospace companies. Widder\u2019s uncle would take his family sailing on weekends to Catalina aboard a 1964 35-foot Erickson sailboat. \n \nWidder and his wife considered an original boat but ultimately decided on a replica of a classic. \n \n\u201cKnowing we would be using our wood boat constantly (and in salt water), we thought otherwise [and decided] to commission a replica 1929 Chris Craft with modern big block fuel injected Chevy power and a West System bottom,\u201d Widder told The Log . \u201c Firecracker will top out at 48 knots on smooth water.\u201d \n \nThe name: Widder, his wife, son and daughter all put suggested names for the boat in a hat. His son\u2019s choice for the name Firecracker got picked. \n \n\u201cI was a bit apprehensive having any kind of name for a wood boat with the word \u2018fire\u2019 in it but in the 4th of July boat parade, it is the perfect name,\u201d Widder stated. \n \nHome Base: When Firecracker is not cruising around Newport Harbor, she is stored at the Lido Drystack in Cannery Village. Slipstream Marine Management in Costa Mesa services her and maintains her wood finish. \n \nAward:  Firecracker has been entered in numerous boat shows under the \u201creplica class\u201d category. She has won \u201cBest Runabout\u201d twice in the Newport Beach Wooden Boat Festival. \n \n(Mark Rightmire photo) \n  Share This","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nina K.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 55 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Chatham","zipCode":"31405","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Savannah","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WJCL.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607684195","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WJCL.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wjcl.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203598261","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tye Dillinger \n\nThis was a pretty standard, but good match between the two Canadian wrestlers. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t really anything fancy here with the storytelling. Young, who was accompanied to the ring by Alexander Wolfe and Sanity\u2019s newest member, Killian Dain, helped their leader win the match to continue the group\u2019s rise to power. \n\nAs for Dillinger, it was yet another disappointing loss at a Takeover event, but hopefully there are brighter days ahead, as it looks like he is poised for a call-up to the main roster. \n\nRoderick Strong def. Andrade \u201cCien\u201d Almas \n\nThis match lacked a story that fans could sink their teeth into heading into the event, but coming out of it, I think both Strong and Almas improved their stock within NXT with impressive performances. \n\nNXT Tag Team championship \u2013 Authors of Pain def. #DIY \n\nThe performance that probably opened the most eyes was the Authors of Pain\u2019s during their victory over #DIY to claim the NXT Tag Team titles. \n\nWhile everyone was aware of the talents of Tommaso Ciampa and Johnny Gargano, I believe the jury was still out amongst the fans as to whether the Authors of Pain could hang with a team like #DIY. \n\nThe contrast in styles between the two teams made for a very entertaining match that told a simple, yet effective story, and to their credit, the Authors proved that they could hang with the likes of Ciampa an Gargano. \n\nSeth Rollins took over NXT Takeover \n\nRollins decided to take matters into his own hands by taking over the show by jumping into the ring and demanding that Triple H show his face. \n\nRollins got what he wanted when Triple H walked from behind the curtain, but the brains behind NXT didn\u2019t run down to the ring for a fight. \n\nInstead, he signaled for security guards to come out and escort Rollins out of the ring. Rollins didn\u2019t go without a fight, as he fended off about a half-dozen members of the security fleet. \n\nBut right before Rollins could finally get his hands on Triple H, more of the cavalry came out to corral Rollins and take him out of the arena. \n\nI thought this was great because it was something we have never seen before on an NXT Takeover. I don\u2019t think WWE main storylines should bleed into NXT often, but in this specific circumstance it made sense since everyone knows Triple H is backstage at every televised WWE event. \n\nIn my mind, I was saying, \u201cIt\u2019s about time!\u201d that Rollins did something like this, and I thought it was cool that it happened on a Takeover instead of another episode of Raw. \n\nRollins popping up made the show feel organic and spontaneous, which I think are two good qualities for a wrestling program to have. \n\nNXT Women\u2019s championship \u2013 Asuka def. Payton Royce, Billie Kay & Nikki Cross \n\nThe stakes only got higher when these four women entered the ring and tore the house down in a match that exceeded a lot of people\u2019s expectations. \n\nI thought the match was structured greatly by having each of the four women shine at various points. \n\nSince they look at themselves as a team, Royce and Kay worked together throughout the match and even managed to slam Cross through a table that was sitting next to the announce table. \n\nJust when it looked like Royce and Kay were about to take full control of the match, Asuka mounted a furious comeback that featured some devastating kicks to pick up the victory and retain the title she has held for more than 300 days. \n\nNXT championship \u2013 Bobby Roode def. Shinsuke Nakamura \n\nThe main event was glorious before the bell even rang, as both Roode and Nakamura had tremendous entrances. \n\nRoode went to the ring with eight women walking with him arm and arm in a scene reminiscent to Ric Flair at one of the old Starrcade during the 1980s. \n\nNakamura glided to the ring on a platform that was decked out with strobe lights. \n\nFor whatever reason, great grand are par for the course in NXT, but are kept to a minimum in WWE. \n\nI understand not having grand entrances for every pay-per-view, but WWE should put a little extra effort into the entrances on the \u201cbig four\u201d shows. \n\nThe match itself was probably the best of the night and featured a very dramatic ending that NXT. \n\nNakamura looked like he was in position to retain the NXT title when he delivered a KINSHASA to Roode on the ring apron. However, Nakamura hurt his knee on the way down and sold it beautifully the rest of the match. \n\nNakamura eventually hit the KINSHASA again, but used his bad knee and injured his knee and worsened the injury in the process. WWE medical eventually ran to the ring to check on him. \n\nWhile that was happening, Roode took his time recovering after being knocked out cold thanks to the second KINSHASA, but bounced back just in time to hit Nakamura with a pair of glorious DDTs to win the NXT championship. \n\nI thought the finish was good because it protected Nakamura, as the injury was made to look so severe that he was nearly unable to continue the match \n\nAs for Roode, he has gone from free agent to the subject of a humorous internet meme to the top man in NXT in less than a year. \n\nOverall, I thought NXT Takeover: San Antonio was a very good show that exceeded even my own expectations. \n\nAs much as NXT seems to be hitting its stride again, the Royal Rumble is Sunday and WrestleMania is fast approaching, which means the brand could lose another crop of stars to the main roster, putting it right back in the position of reloading yet again. \n\nOn the surface, that would be NXT in a precarious position, but if Saturday is any indication, the brain trust at the WWE Performance Center will find a way to keep things moving in a positive direction.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Vaughn Johnson"},"topics":[{"name":"San Antonio news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"WWE NXT Takeover: San Antonio results and observations","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203598858","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hamilton","zipCode":"37401","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chattanooga","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGOW 1150 AM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"187204536","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WGOW 1150 AM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgowam.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203600025","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"York","zipCode":"29730","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Rock Hill","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rock Hill Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657448","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1027"},"name":"Rock Hill Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203601316","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful.

No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hamilton","zipCode":"37401","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chattanooga","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGOW 1150 AM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"187204536","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WGOW 1150 AM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgowam.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203602165","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Hunt Dumont to set aside the verdict and have a new trial ordered. \n   \nAfter a two-month civil trial, Bailey was awarded $50,000 in damages and an additional $37,403 on Tuesday, Dec. 20, to cover lost wages when she took a nine-month leave of absence in 2014 after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, after a Morris County civil jury found that she had suffered emotional distress and was a victim of harassment because of her gender by higher ranking officers in the department. \n   \nBailey received a separate check for $40,000 from the township to cover lost wages in 2014. \n   \nHarrison claimed in his motion that the jury was incorrectly told by the judge that Bailey had participated in three counts of \"protected activity\" under New Jersey Law Against Discrimination . \n   \nTwo of the instances were separate conversations in 2010 and 2011 between Bailey former Randolph Police Chief Robert Mason in which she said it was unfair that female officers be penalized for using sick days to take care of sick children at home according to court documents. \n   \nThe conversations took place after Bailey was passed over for a promotion to sergeant in consecutive years. \n   \nThe third instance was Bailey's continued efforts to seek that promotion while she maintained a good faith despite her belief that gender discrimination existed within the department. \n   \nAttorneys Richard Murray and Omar Lopez, who represented Bailey in the trial, have opposed Harrison's motion. \n   \nAccording to court papers, Murray said that Harrison \"failed to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that there has been a miscarriage of justice that warrants a new trial.\" \n   \nIn the court papers, Murray argues that Dumont's legal charge to the jury and on the verdict sheet were correct, despite Harrison's claims. \n   \nHarrison wrote that the three acts and evidence in the trail did not establish protected activity under Law Against Discrimination and that the only protected activity was the filing of the 2012 lawsuit. \n   \nHarrison claimed that Bailey's supervisors did not treat her any differently than they would treat any of the male police officers in the department and called witnesses at the trail to support his claim. \n   \nThe verdict sheet did not specify which actions of the ranking officers originally named as defendants by Bailey were found to be offensive or discriminatory towards Bailey and resulted in the award. \n   \nBy the end of the trial, Randolph Township was the sole defendant in the case although when she originally filed the lawsuit in 2012, Bailey had sued Mason, current Randolph Police Chief David Stokoe, Lts. William Harzula and Christopher Giuliani and former Township Manager John Lovell. \n   \nIn the trail, Bailey alleged that she had been passed over for the promotion to sergeant because of her gender and that after questioning Mason about the results of her sergeants exams, which she did not pass, she was intimidated by Mason. \n   \nShe testified that Mason pressed his body up against hers and that she was the target of internal affairs investigations and corrective action mandates, which she alleged were not endured my male officers on the force. \n   \nDuring the trial, the jury found that Bailey did not prove that she should have been promoted to sergeant. \n   \nA date has not yet been set for the judge to hear Harrison's motion for a new trial.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Randolph Police Department files motion for new trial in discrimination case","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morris","zipCode":"07940","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Madison","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Chatham Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175529470","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Chatham Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://newjerseyhills.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.randolphnj.org/","http://www.randolphnj.org/POLICE","http://www.nj.gov/oag/dcr/law.html#LAD"],"sequenceId":"695203603854","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

A major generator of Victoria's coal-fired electricity is set to be expanded, sparking protests from environment groups over the effect on carbon emissions.\n\nThe planned upgrade of the Loy Yang B power station in the Latrobe Valley comes as its majority owner, Engie, prepares to shut down the Hazelwood plant and coal mine in March.\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted \"works approval\" to upgrade turbines at the plant, which will result in the burning of an extra 400,000 tonnes of coal each year.\n\nLoy Yang B provides about 17 per cent of Victoria's energy needs.\n\nThe EPA insists it has imposed strict conditions on the power generator, so there will be no additional detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nEPA development assessments manager Tim Faragher said the decision allowed higher-efficiency turbine blades to be fitted to the power-generating units.\n\nHe said the new turbines would improve power generation capacity 8.6 per cent but decrease the intensity of emissions by 5 per cent.\n\n\"The upgrade will make Loy Yang B the least greenhouse-intensive brown coal-fired power generator in Victoria,\" Mr Faragher said.\n\nHe said at least 114 megawatts of coal-fired electricity generation capacity had to be retired before the upgrade could proceed. However, the closure of Hazelwood would satisfy that reduction.\n\nHazelwood produced about 13 per cent of Victoria's emissions and up to a quarter of its electricity.\n\nEnvironment Victoria chief executive Mark Wakeham said the EPA's decision was \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nThe plant's expansion would make it harder for the state government to reach its target of zero emissions by 2050, he said.\n\n\"If Victoria is to keep its commitments to contribute to global efforts to stay below two degrees of warming, brown coal-power stations need to be phased out urgently,\" Mr Wakeham said.\n\nThe EPA confirmed that burning the additional coal would result in a 4 per cent increase in carbon emissions at Loy Yang B.\n\nBut Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the decision meant lower emissions for Victoria.\n\nLatrobe Valley community group Voices of the Valley has also raised concerns about the expansion. The group's president, Wendy Farmer, said the power station's pollution allowance was too high.\n\nEngie welcomed the move, saying the upgrade would improve the station's efficiency and \"increase operating flexibility\".\n\nThe upgrade will occur in 2019 and 2020 during \"planned major outages\". In a community update issued before the approval, Engie described Loy Yang B as one of the most efficient power stations in the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\"The new turbine design for the retrofit of the existing turbines will result in further improvement,\" it said.\n\nLoy Yang B employs about 150 full-time staff. It is supplied with coal by a neighbouring mine.\n\nFriends of the Earth criticised the expansion, saying it would prolong coal generation when urgent action was required to tackle climate change.\n\n\"It's time to bring the EPA into the 21st century so it can play a key role in tackling climate change,\" the group said.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Engie hopes to sell Loy Yang B.

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion. \n \nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed. \n \nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory. \n \n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Dulles airport. \n \nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty. \n \nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport. \n \nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided. \n \nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darwish, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d \n \nThe groups bringing the legal challenge said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry. \n \nArab-American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world. \n \n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters. \n \nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said. \n \nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. \n \nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2013 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. \n \nAs the measure\u2019s far-reaching effect became clear, and the airport chaos mounted throughout the day, Trump denied it was a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and said the process was going smoothly. \u201cWe were totally prepared,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban.\u201d \n \nThe move has hit the technology industry, which employs thousands of foreign-born workers, many from Muslim-majority countries. Google chief executive Sundai Pichar on Friday slammed Trump\u2019s executive order in a memo to employees, saying about 100 employees were affected, and advising those traveling abroad to reach out to the company\u2019s immigration teams for assistance. \n \nIn Congress, reaction to the immigration chaos tended to break down along party lines, with vociferous criticism from Democrats while Republicans largely remained silent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Laura King, Barbara Demick and Molly Hennessy-Fiske"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Judges block Trump\u2019s immigration order amid chaos at airports worldwide - Sat, 28 Jan 2017 PST","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spokane","zipCode":"99201","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spokane","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spokesman-Review.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685632","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4935"},"name":"Spokesman-Review.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://spokesmanreview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203608453","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was just over a year earlier when he had called Trump\u2019s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States \u201coffensive and unconstitutional.\u201d That was before Trump picked him as his running mate and won the election. \n \nTrump sat down after his speech, signed the executive order and handed it to Mattis \u2013 a retired general who six months earlier had said the mere suggestion of a ban on Muslims caused \u201cgreat damage\u201d to world order. \n \nNow, Mattis was defense secretary. He took the order and grinned while Pence started clapping. \n \nLike other Republicans, the two men\u2019s condemnations of Trump\u2019s words had evaporated as he drew closer to power \u2013 and as his original call for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d morphed into a nearly 3,000-word order that does not mention Islam but temporarily bar visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n \nOne of those countries, Syria, had attracted Pence\u2019s scrutiny even before a young Trump campaign waded into the issue in late 2015. \n \nHe was one of more than two dozen governors who called for a suspension of Syrian refugees that year \u2013 as a civil war there fueled fears that terrorists would slip into the United States amid the wave of evacuees. \n \nBut when Trump upped the ante in December \u2013 calling for a border ban on all Muslims \u201cuntil our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on\u201d \u2013 Pence joined the immediate Republican backlash. \n \nTrump\u2019s words may have been \u201coffensive\u201d to Pence, but they were popular with others. After winning contest after contest in the spring primaries and turning his sights on the general election, Trump blasted Democrat Hillary Clinton for border policies that would \u201clet the Muslims flow in.\u201d \n \nA few months later, a taciturn retired general who had overseen all U.S. military operations in the Middle East felt compelled to speak out against Trump. \n \nThe call for a Muslim ban was causing American allies to think \u201cwe have lost faith in reason,\u201d Mattis told Politico last July. \n \n\u201cThey think we\u2019ve completely lost it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sending shock waves through this international system.\u201d \n \nHe and Pence were joined in displeasure by Republicans across the spectrum. By former Vice President Richard B. Cheney, who said banning a religion \u201cgoes against everything we stand for,\u201d and who echoes language by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and many others. \n \nEven Trump\u2019s campaign eventually distanced itself from his rhetoric. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Contract with the American Voter,\u201d released last October, mentions no Muslim ban, but rather \u201cextreme vetting\u201d and a halt on immigration \u201cfrom terror-prone regions.\u201d \n \nAnd by late 2016, with prospects for White House jobs in the wind, some of Trump\u2019s former critics went mum on the issue. \n \nA CNN host confronted Pence about his silence in October, long after he\u2019d left the Indiana governor\u2019s office to campaign as Trump\u2019s running mate. \n \n\u201cWhat he has said about women, about Mexicans, about Muslims matters,\u201d the host said. \u201cNow you are tacitly accepting those positions because you won\u2019t speak out.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not Donald Trump\u2019s position now,\u201d Pence said of the ban, according to CNN. He fell back on the campaign\u2019s latter-day language about terrorist-linked countries rather than Muslims. \n \nTrump\u2019s secretary of state designate backed the president up at his confirmation hearing this month. \u201cHe does not support a blanket-type rejection of any particular group of people,\u201d Rex Tillerson promised Congress. \n \nSure enough, Friday\u2019s executive order makes no mention of Islam. \n \nIt bans any visitors from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia from entering the United States for any reason for three months, with broader restrictions on the refugee program. \n \nNone of those seven countries make up more than a few percentage points of the global Muslim population, according to a 2009 Pew study, although together they contain the majority of world\u2019s Shiite Muslim minority. \n \nAnd just before signing the order, Trump suggested to the Christian Broadcasting Network that religion was not far from his mind. \n \nOnce he restarts the refugee program, Trump told the outlet, Christians fleeing war and terror in the Middle East would get priority over others. \n \n\u201cThey were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,\u201d he said of Syria \u2013 failing to mention that far more Muslims have been killed or displaced in that civil war. \n \nNeither Pence nor Mattis have commented in public about the executive order after applauding its signing on Friday. \n \nBut another compatriot from their days as Trump critics has offered his take. \n \nRyan, who once called any Muslim ban un-American, said in a statement Friday that \u201cPresident Trump is right.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it\u2019s time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process,\u201d Ryan said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Avi Selk"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Despite earlier remarks, Pence applauds Trump\u2019s ban on refugees - Sat, 28 Jan 2017 PST","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spokane","zipCode":"99201","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spokane","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spokesman-Review.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685632","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4935"},"name":"Spokesman-Review.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://spokesmanreview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203608636","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.spokesman.com/photos/2017/01/29/Trump.JPG_t75x75_fsharpen.jpg?c089dee51a6323bd6b38604bb2cb9f7270a1e6f9"}],"video":[]}}

We will investigate and prosecute wherever appropriate, and press for the strongest sanctions.\" \n \nAfter the couple found themselves under investigation, the Vasco-Knights tried to retrospectively manufacture a document to justify the payment of the invoice. Entitled 'Transform', they presented it in March 2015 at an interview under caution with investigators. \n \nNHS Protect investigators established that the document could not possibly have been produced in November 2013 as stated, as it contained large passages of text copied straight from a bona fide King's Fund document that wasn't published until November 2014 - a year later. \n \nAs part of the investigation a number of laptops, mobile devices and PCs were obtained from South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and NHS England, and examined by NHS Protect's computer forensics specialists. \n \nPaula Vasco-Knight was employed as Chief Executive Officer of South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in August 2008. Her additional role as National Lead for Equality at NHS England began in 2012, when it was still known as the NHS Commissioning Board. She had a high-profile and was awarded a CBE for her work on equality and diversity in the NHS in the January 2014 Honours List. \n \nAt the end of the hearing the judge warned Ms Vasco-Knight she could be sent to jail. \n \nThe pair will be sentenced on March 10. \n MORE NEWS","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"NHS news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Disgraced Torbay Hospital boss Vasco-Knight should face strong...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Devon","zipCode":"TQ2","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Torbay","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Torquay Herald Express","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"370627421","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Torquay Herald Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://torquayheraldexpress.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203612210","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276409/Article/images/30092407/15824617-thumb.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 58 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203617302","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He was 103. \n \nHartle died Tuesday afternoon at an Escondido, California, center for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported Friday . A reporter was at his bedside with Hartle\u2019s son and daughter three hours before his death. \n \nHartle may have been the oldest surviving Pearl Harbor salvage diver, said David Ball of San Diego, an officer with the Navy Divers Association. \n \nHartle and his fellow Seabees worked in the days before scuba diving equipment was commonplace. His heavy canvas diving suit and brass helmet weighed more than 200 pounds. \n \nJapan\u2019s Dec. 7, 1941, surprise attack on Pearl Harbor sank or beached 18 ships. Among them was the battleship Arizona, which went down with 1,177 crew members. \n \nHartle was working as a civilian ship-fitter at a Navy yard in the San Francisco Bay Area when the war broke out, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to enlist until 1943 because his job was deemed too important to the war effort. \n \nHartle was proud of the work he performed over the next two years, his children said. He risked death by towing away unexploded torpedoes and salvaging ships and planes, first at Pearl Harbor and later from Maine to the Philippines. \n \nHe suffered the bends \u2013 painful and dangerous bubbles in his bloodstream from improper decompression \u2013 and was nearly killed when an anchor chain cracked and spewed metal shards. \n \nBut he avoided mentioning one task: recovering the long-submerged bodies of sailors who went to the bottom at Pearl Harbor. \n \n\u201cHe just didn\u2019t like talking about it,\u201d said his son, Ken W. Hartle, 64, of Montana. \u201cHe would only say that the hardest part of the job was \u2018bringing up our boys.\u2019 \u201d \n \nHis son said Hartle managed to cheat death several times, beginning at age 3 when a mule kicked him in the face and knocked him unconscious for 20 hours. \n \nHe had colon and prostate cancer, six heart bypass surgeries, and broke his shoulder falling from a ladder while trimming trees when he was 97. \n \n\u201cHe was from a generation of people who were amazingly tough,\u201d said his daughter and longtime caregiver, Karen Dahl, 66. \u201cHe had a lot of problems with pain from the work he did in his younger life, but he never complained.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Navy diver who salvaged bodies from Pearl Harbor dies at 103 - Sat, 28 Jan 2017 PST","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spokane","zipCode":"99201","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spokane","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spokesman-Review.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685632","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4935"},"name":"Spokesman-Review.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://spokesmanreview.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2jnUNzC"],"sequenceId":"695203624282","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Henry","zipCode":"47362","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New Castle","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"NASH FM 102.5","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"525649174","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"NASH FM 102.5","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nashfm1025.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203628291","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Facing a ranked team on the road did not stop Colorado State University-Pueblo Women's Basketball's historic win streak. The No.4 ranked ThunderWolves rolled past No. 18-0 Regis University 65-51 to move to 21-0 for the first time in school history. \n \nAt 15-0 in Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference games, the Pack now enjoys a three-game lead on every other team in the RMAC. Regis, the Pack's closest competition in the RMAC, plummeted to 11-3 in RMAC games and 16-3 overall. \n \nMolly Rohrer (So., Greenwood Village, Colo.) took over the game in the second half. Rohrer finished with 19 points, 17 of which came after intermission. She made 7-of-15 from the field and 5-of-6 from the line. Rohrer also snagged four rebounds. \n \nSenior Angie Moore (Katy, Texas)carried the Pack's offense in the first half, scoring all 10 of her points before halftime. Moore went 4-of-8 from the field and added five rebounds. \n \nDespite a battle with foul trouble, Katie Cunningham (Aurora, Colo.), the RMAC's leading rebounder secured 10 rebounds. Cunningham scored seven points, going a perfect 3-of-3 from the field. She came away with a steal and a block. \n \nJunior Tuileisu Anderson (Vancouver, Wash.) tacked on 11 points on 4-of-10 shooting. Anderson also collected four rebounds. \n \nJaszymn Johnson (Denver, Colo.) drained three 3-pointers. She finished with nine points. Defensively, Johnson came away with five rebounds and a block. Sophomore Lauren Heyn (Loomis, Calif.) led the Pack with two blocks. \n \nCSU-Pueblo held a decisive advantage shooting the ball. The Pack made 42.1 percent compared to just 24.6 percent shooting from the Rangers. Not only did the Pack's defense limit Regis to 24.6 from the field, they also swatted seven Ranger shots. \n \nA see-saw battle early gave the Rangers a 6-4 lead. The Pack quickly erased it with a 7-0 run. Regis would reclaim the lead 16-15. A conventional three-point play from Moore gave the Pack an 18-16 lead after one. \n \nRegis would take its final lead early in the second quarter on a 3-pointer that made it 19-18. CSU-Pueblo answered with a 7-1 run. The Pack led by as many as seven late in the second, but would carry a 32-28 edge into the break. Regis' Mary Sigler scored 22 of her team's 28 points in the first half. She would finish with 29. \n \nUp 36-32 early in the second half, Rohrer and the Pack took over. CSU-Pueblo went on a 9-0 run to put the Pack up 45-32. Rohrer scored eight of the nine points during this stretch. CSU-Pueblo had a 9-4 run the rest of the way to carry a 52-38 lead into the fourth. Rohrer scored 12 points in the third. \nThough Regis trimmed the Pack lead back to single digits, CSU-Pueblo would pull away with a 6-0 run to make it 60-46. The ThunderWolves would go on to defeat the Rangers 65-51 to reach 21-0. \n \nAfter beating their second ranked team of the season, the ThunderWolves will return home Friday Feb. 3 to play rival Adams State University at 5:30 p.m. \n \nThe following night will be the annual Take a Kid to a game night against Fort Lewis College. Denver Nuggets super mascot Rocky will be at this game to entertain the fans.

Freshman Brady Tomlak scored the game-winning goal in the third period as Air Force earned a series sweep over Army with a 3-2 win an Atlantic Hockey Conference game Saturday, Jan. 28, at a sold out Cadet Ice Arena. Air Force improved to 16-8-4 overall and 13-5-2 in the conference. \n \nAfter a scoreless first period in which each team had seven shots on goal, Army lit the lamp first. Just as an Army power was expiring, the Falcons went for a clear from behind its goal line and Blake Box knocked it down at the blue line. Just after the penalty expired, Box\u2019s wrister from the right point snuck inside the far post for a 1-0 Black Knight lead at 7:26 mark. The Falcons battled back to take a 2-1 lead with two goals in a span of 47 seconds. Dan Bailey tied the game at 15:05 as he carried the puck down the right side and took a wrister from the right circle that found the back of the net. Tyler Rostenkowski and Kyle Haak assisted on the goal. Air Force took its first lead of the game when Phil Boje fired a shot from the left point that was redirected by Tyler Ledford at 15:52. \n \nThe Falcons took a 3-1 lead midway through the third period. Tomlak won a faceoff in the offensive zone and Bailey took a shot from the point. After winning the draw, Tomlak spun back to the front of the net and redirected Bailey\u2019s shot past Parker Gahagen at 13:10. Late in the period, in a delayed penalty situation, Conor Anderle sent a pass to the front of the net that went off the skate of Black Knight forward Michael Wilson and into the net with 2:08 remaining. On the power play, Army pulled its goalie and had a 6-on-4 advantage. With the two-man advantage, Army had one shot on goal and the Falcons blocked four shots. In the final seconds, Falcon freshman Trevor Stone dove in front of Nick DeCenzo\u2019s shot as time expired. \n \nAir Force outshot Army, 34-25, in the game. Army and Air Force both rank in the top 10 in the nation in penalty kill and neither gave up a power play goal in the series. Army was 0-for-6 while Air Force was 0-for-5 in game two. Shane Starrett made 23 saves while Parker Gahagen made 31. \n \n\u201cThis was a huge series,\u201d head coach Frank Serratore said. \u201cThis win enabled us to maintain our position in the standings. It was a gutsy performance by our guys. Shane Starrett was really good. He made some very timely saves. The turning point was the save Shane made on Mansfield\u2019s breakaway. That was huge. We were down 1-0 and if that goes in, it could have been a different outcome. We had to overcome some chaos at the end, but I wouldn\u2019t expect any different. Give our guys a lot of credit because Army has a good team.\u201d \n \nAir Force travels to Bentley for a two-game league series, Friday-Saturday, Feb. 3-4, in Waltham, Mass.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Falcons sweep Army with 3-2 win in series finale","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"El Paso","zipCode":"80907","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Colorado Springs","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KKTV.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693011","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"230"},"name":"KKTV.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kktv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203637009","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travellers to stay in the United States. \n  \nSupporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. \n  \nThe court action does not reverse Trump's order, which was criticized by some of America's closest allies. \n  \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. \n  \nHe told reporters in the White House's Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n  \n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump said. \n  \nAlong with Syria, the ban affects travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n  \nThe Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travellers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. \n  \nThe order \"affects a minor portion of international travellers,\" the department said in a statement, saying the measures \"inconvenienced\" less than 1 percent of travellers.  \n  \nThe new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. \n  \nPegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington's Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \"They weren't treating them very well,\" she said. \n  \nRahmani's grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. \n  \n'TIP OF THE SPEAR' \n  \nSeveral Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \n  \n\"I don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \"This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\" \n  \nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. \n  \nThe Department of Homeland Security said the order would stay in place. \n  \n\"No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States,\" the department statement said. \n  \nMark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called lawsuits challenging the order \"last ditch efforts\" that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \n  \n\"The first amendment doesn't apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\" Krikorian said. \n  \nSome leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \n  \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people,\" said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. \n  \nArab travellers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. \n  \nSudan called the action \"very unfortunate\" after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n  \nIraq's former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump's ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \n  \n\"We have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. \n  \nAllies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. \n  \nGREEN CARD CONFUSION \n  \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. \n  \nHowever, senior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\" to broadcast details of the order in advance. \n  \nOther officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. \n  \nAirlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. \n  \nTravellers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. \n  \nAt Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. \n  \nThey knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \"I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it,\" Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \"A lot of politicians just talk.\" \n  \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n  \nTrump's order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. \n  \nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. \n  \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \"national interest.\" \n  \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said: \"It's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\" \n  \n(Reporting by Yara Bayoumy, Jeff Mason, Roberta Rampton, Doina Chiacu, Lesley Wroughton, Yeganeh Torbati in Washington; Mica Rosenberg, Jonathan Allen, Melissa Fares, Daniel Trotta and David Ingram in New York; Robert Chiarito in Chicago; Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Lisa Maria Garza in Dallas; Alissa Greenberg, Joseph Menn, Julia Love and Kristina Cook in San Francisco; Jeffrey Dastin in Redwood City, California; Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Khalid Abdelaziz in Khartoum; Parisa Hafezi in Dubai; Andrea Hopkins, Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto; Writing by Doina Chiacu and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Grant Mary Milliken, Bill Rigby and Paul Tait) \n  Next In World News     Putin and Trump agree to try to rebuild U.S.-Russia ties, cooperate in Syria  \nMOSCOW Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to try to rebuild U.S. Russia ties and to cooperate in Syria, the Kremlin said on Saturday, after the two men spoke for the first time since Trump's inauguration. \n    Trump bars door to refugees, visitors from seven mainly Muslim nations  \nWASHINGTON/CAIRO Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. \n    In Turkey visit, May pushes trade, mentions human rights  \nANKARA British Prime Minister Theresa May signed a $125 million (£100 million) fighter jet deal with Turkey on Saturday and briefly cautioned Ankara on human rights following last year's failed coup, in a visit squarely aimed at boosting trade between the NATO allies.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"WRAPUP 6-Chaos, anger as Trump order halts some Muslim immigrants","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Reuters UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587711","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Reuters UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Materials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.reuters.com/","publisher":"Thomson Reuters"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203638269","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the White House, said: \"Nothing in the Brooklyn judge's order in anyway impedes or prevents the implementation of the president's executive order which remains in full, complete and total effect.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York issued the emergency order after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect.\n\nThe judge's order addressed only a portion of Trump's executive action. As the decision was announced, cheers broke out in crowds of demonstrators who had gathered at American airports and outside the Brooklyn courthouse where the ruling was issued.\n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nIt was unclear how quickly the judge's order might affect people in detention, or whether it would allow others to resume flying. The White House said the court ruling affected a small number of people who had boarded planes before the White House order was issued.\n\nHomeland Security said those travelers \"were inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented. These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders.\"\n\nBut the detention of the travelers caused a great deal of confusion.\n\n\"Realistically, we don't even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes,\" said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt. \"This order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach U.S. soil.\"\n\nUnder Trump's order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas. However, an official with the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday night that no green-card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump's order had been prevented from entering the U.S.\n\nSome foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday had been detained at U.S. airports, told they were no longer welcome. The DHS official who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.\n\nIn her three-page order, Donnelly wrote that without the stay \"there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders and other individuals from nations subject to the Jan. 27, 2017, executive order.\"\n\nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\n\nTrump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war.\n\nThe directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the September 11 hijackers.\n\nAs a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the U.S., then said he would implement \"extreme vetting\" for people from countries with significant terror concerns. He told reporters Saturday the order is \"not a Muslim ban.\"\n\n\"It's working out very nicely,\" Trump said of the implementation of his order. \"We're going to have a very, very strict ban and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\"\n\nThe order sparked protests at several of the nation's international airports, including New York's Kennedy and Chicago's O'Hare and facilities in Minneapolis and Dallas-Fort Worth. In San Francisco, hundreds blocked the street outside the arrival area of the international terminal. Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \"Portland Coffee Is From Yemen\" and chanting anti-Trump slogans. U.S. lawmakers and officials around the globe also criticized the move.\n\nTwo of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the U.S. military. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York's Kennedy airport Friday night. Both had been released by Saturday night after their lawyers intervened.\n\nThe government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied.\n\nDiplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump's order would still be allowed into the U.S.\n\nThose already in the U.S. with a visa or green card would be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump's order also directed U.S. officials to review information as needed to fully vet foreigners asking to come to the U.S. and draft a list of countries that don't provide that information. That left open the possibility that citizens of other countries could also face a travel ban.\n\nThe U.S. may still admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government would continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.\"\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of Trump's order.\n\n\"There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\" said Lena F. Masri, the group's national litigation director. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\"\n\nJohn Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations, said the order didn't address America's \"primary terrorism-related threat\" - people already in the U.S. who become inspired by what they see on the internet.\n\nTrump's order drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program, particularly for those from Syria.\n\nIt is unclear how many people would be immediately impacted by the non-refugee travel ban. According to the statistics maintained by the Homeland Security Department, about 17,000 students from the seven designated countries were allowed into the U.S. for the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015 more than 86,000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. on other, non-immigrant visas and more than 52,000 others became legal permanent residents.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. resettled 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice, including more than 12,000 Syrians. Before leaving office President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would accept 110,000 refugees in the coming year, but Trump's order cut that by more than half to 5","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Deccan Chronicle"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"US judge bars deportations under Trump travel...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203647822","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:28Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/1717b3b3d0bc924b7bf77fe81eb82bcc.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Davidson","zipCode":"37203","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Nashville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"997WTN.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"476844047","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"997WTN.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.997wtn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203654538","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Davidson","zipCode":"37203","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Nashville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"997WTN.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"476844047","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"997WTN.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.997wtn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203659962","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\"\n\nAnother sticking point is training.\n\nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.\n\nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.\n\nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.\n\nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.\n\n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said.\n\nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.\n\nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.\n\n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said.\n\n\"It was really great.

All he was stating is not everyone wants or needs some of the features that are now on new vehicles. I appreciate the technology that now offers antilock brakes, collision avoidance, etc. In fact my last new car was ordered with manual transmission and no air-conditioning, and the option package offered no choice of radio or interior trim. That was fine with me. \n\n- K.S., Mokena, Ill. \n\nOur club of car enthusiasts unanimously (15) found your answer to C.P. from Elmhurst to be impolite, condescending, and indicating a rather large lack of information about this. Polls taken over the past year at various national club meetings indicate that most people over 55 find the new auto tech to be unnecessary. I have several friends who sell new cars, and a few who actually have dealerships. Guess what is the most common complaint most of the car-buying public age 45 or older is? When you need classes or a CD to learn how to run you car after paying $45,000-plus, it seems a bit over the top. \n\n- R., Naperville, Ill. \n\nYou did not answer part of C.P.'s question. Specifically, you did not answer \"Are any car manufacturers building any vehicles without all this high-tech stuff.\" It is a fair question that deserves some attention, especially from the manufacturers. I have a 2012 Buick LaCrosse with a ton of stuff on the dashboard. I do not think I have ever used one-tenth of it. \n\n- R.G., Chicago \n\nI read your sarcastic answer. Boomer had some good points. Driving is a function to get from one place to another - it is not meant to be entertainment. Your snarky answer asking if he wanted to go back to no seat belts and air bags concerned safety improvements - while he was complaining about bells and whistles. Don't dismiss all his points as they are shared by many other drivers. \n\n- A.M., Chicago \n\nI have to agree with the irate baby boomer who wrote in asking for a basic car without all the bells and whistles. I think there would be a huge market for this and will congratulate the automaker that addresses the need for a basic vehicle. All of this unnecessary electronic mumbo-jumbo just adds cost and distraction. How about something for auto-disabling text on phones or impaired-driver detection? Best wishes for a happy new year! \n\n- N.S., Wethersfield, Conn. \n\nAnswer: Many thanks to our readers who took the time to write - both those who took us to task and those who did not. We took the liberty of editing your responses for space. Yeah, maybe we were a bit snarky. Even Mrs. Motormouth said so, and she is married to this boomer. You can still find vehicles without all of the electronic wizardry. Just shop the lower-end models. You will get what you need, without much of the stuff you don't want. \n\nBob Weber is a writer and certified Master Automobile Technician.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KansasCity.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657780","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"362"},"name":"KansasCity.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansascity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203664083","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

What did they want? And why did they all drive these overdressed, overpriced pumped-up German cars? \n\nIt wasn't until I drove and reviewed a few that I understood. Whatever their motivations for buying these vehicles - Teutonic pride, conspicuous consumption, or antipathy for automobiles of American or Japanese provenance - the vehicles were terrific. \n\nAudi's Q7 is the company's flagship SUV. A three-row seven-seater, the Q7 comes standard with a raft of technological appurtenances that make it a pleasure to drive. \n\nThe drive train comprises Audi's 3.0-liter V-6 gasoline engine (a 2.0-liter version is also available) mated to Audi's 8-speed \"Tiptronic\" transmission. The engine makes an impressive 333 horsepower and 325 pound feet of torque - more than enough to make this 5,000-pound machine nimble in traffic as well as stable on the highway. \n\nThe weight isn't hard to explain. Standard on the Q7 are wide, comfortable, heated seats, leather-bound and 8-way adjustable; a two-panel panoramic sunroof; power tail gate; roof rails; rollover bars; folding third-row seats; three-zone climate control; and a healthy array of front, side, and head curtain air bags. \n\nThe model I drove, which kicked the $55,750 MSRP up to $85,425, also included the Prestige, Luxury, Adaptive Chassis, Driver Assistance, and Towing packages. \n\nThose enabled, among other things, four-wheel steering; adaptive air suspension; adaptive cruise control; lane-departure warning; Audi's \"traffic sign recognition\" system; a heads-up dashboard display; and many other comfort, convenience, and safety features - though the full-size spare that many drivers expect was not included. \n\nThe result was a sublime driving experience. The four-wheel steering, paddle shifters and drive modes, which included a sporty \"sport\" setting, gave the big SUV a light, lithe feeling around town and on curvy canyon roads. \n\nThe interior was so elegant, refined, and quiet that the sharp acceleration allowed by the big torquey engine seemed almost ill-mannered. \n\nIn sport setting, the vehicle tended to lurch a bit when pushed hard, giving it a slightly unstable feeling when accelerating from a stop or out of a slow corner. \n\nAll that power and fast forward motion mean, alas, pretty poor fuel economy. Like many SUVs, this one gets only a combined 21 miles per gallon driving on city streets and highways. The dashboard readout suggested that my lead-footed driving pushed that number quite a bit lower. \n\nBut my goodness is it comfortable. The driver and passenger seats are a marvel of ergonomic pleasure. The leg- and headroom in the second and third rows was Business Class impressive. The push-button system that makes the third-row seats disappear creates a lot of storage room, too. Audi puts the total storage room, with seats folded, at 71.6 cubic feet. That should be room enough for five golf bags - and five golfers. \n\nOn the outside, the Q7 isn't very distinguished. But, what SUVs are? \n\nTo my eye, they almost all have what a friend of mine used to call the \"pregnant hamster\" look - sporty at the front, but rather thick in the middle and the behind.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Charles Fleming"},"topics":[{"name":"Automotive industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Volkswagen news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"2017 Audi Q7: The pleasures of the pricier people mover","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203664435","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:33:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She said DeVos \u201cis not a friend of public education\u201d and that her history would indicate that she\u2019s not the most qualified person for the job. The board will convene at 5:30 p.m. Monday at the district\u2019s administration building at 176 Walk Road to discuss the resolution. \n \n\u201cWe need someone who can champion public schools. I don\u2019t think (DeVos) is qualified for that,\u201d Golding said. \u201cShe comes from a very wealthy family, she\u2019s spent a lot of money undermining public education and I really think she\u2019s done nothing to improve the quality of children\u2019s education in Michigan. I can\u2019t imagine, going across 50 states, what she\u2019d do to funding, programs and all the good things the federal government does in support of in public education.\u201d \n \nThough she declined to state whether she felt the motion was likely to pass, she said that many people in the district have told her they worry about what DeVos could do if she is appointed to the top position of the U.S. Department of Education. \n \nOther board members also say they have to discuss the matter before deciding what to do as a collective entity.

Her daughter, Barbara Michaels, said the family covered the cost of installing the stone statue because they thought it would be a fitting tribute to her mother. \n \n\"That's terrible,\" reads the final response at 7:08 p.m. before the story made a turn for the better. The original posting had generated 42 comments and 65 shares. \n \n\u201cThat first post reached over 9,000 people, which is incredible for us,\u201d Domagolski said, adding, \u201cWhen we have an event and post it to Facebook we usually reach 200 to 300 people.\u201d \n \nAround 8 p.m., Domagolski said Falls police were alerted that a statue similar to the one being discussed on Facebook was standing on the sidewalk on the 1600 block of Falls Street, about two blocks away from the church building. \n \nMinutes later, at 8:52 p.m., an excited Domagolski posts: \u201cThe power of prayer, the power of faith and the power in numbers of friends and social media. \n \nI am elated to share the news that the Blessed Mother statue was found this evening and returned by the Niagara Falls Police department just a few moments ago. \n \nA very special thank you to each and everyone of you who commented, shared my post from yesterday, prayed for a safe return, and to the individual who spotted Blessed Mother and called the Police Department. Of course, thank you to the Niagara Falls Police Department as well. She is back home. Thank you Jesus for answering our prayers for a safe return.\u201d \n \nThe entire incident was a lesson in the power of social media for Domagolski. \n \nShe was both surprised in the response her initial posting generated and feels whomever took the statue had second thoughts after all the attention it drew. They then left the Virgin Mary on the Falls Street sidewalk so it could easily be found. \n \n\"I have a strong faith,\" she said, \"that's my belief \u2014 God works in his way.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Winterhalter matt.winterhalter@niagara-gazette.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Buffalo-Niagara Falls news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Social media news","group":"Internet"}],"title":"A look back at how social media saved the day for Holy Trinity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Niagara","zipCode":"14302","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Niagara Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Niagara Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169790986","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Niagara Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.niagara-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203665626","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T22:38:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/niagara-gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/54/7542c2cc-8060-54fd-be24-c80d82df45b3/588d1f2441f1d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C451"}],"video":[]}}

An elderly man in the convention center lobby, watching a television set provided by the staff, was grumbling that the TV was black-and-whiite and and he preferred color.  \n \nThe National Weather Service noted the blizzard occurred in the first January in 107 years that the temperature was recorded as below freezing every day of the month. The average temperature was 13.8 degrees, the coldest ever. The 38 inches of snow on the ground in the last three days of January broke by four inches the old mark set in 1966. \n \nThe two local radio stations, WJJL and WHLD, with licenses limited to daytime programming, secured permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to extend their broadcasting hours as needed.  \n \nRadio talk show host Tom Darro of WJJL, called the blizzard the second biggest story of his news career, next to Love Canal. In recalling the storm, he said he had covered a carpet store explosion until the early hours of Jan. 27, the day the storm began. He had gone straight to the station  to prepare the morning news and the storm hit later that afternoon. He didn't know then that his station would be on the air straight through to the following Wednesday.  \n \nBoth local stations devoted their air-time solely to providing updates on conditions throughout the city and county and helping to coordinate a fleet of four-wheel drive vehicles and volunteer drivers to deliver medicines, food supplies and other essential items to those stranded.  \n \n\"It was amazing actually,\" Darro said this past week. \"Twenty minutes after we announced we were staying on the air, we had a fleet of four-wheel drive vehicles and snowmobiles.\"  \n \nThe volunteers were used mostly to rescue people who were stranded in their cars or to pick up and deliver medications. Darro remembered that a doctor was taken by one of the volunteers to the Grand Island bridge where he delivered a baby. \n \nAmidst the hectic pace to assist those in need, a North End woman called one of the stations to complain that she had asked for large eggs and they had brought her medium. Most listeners, however, were indebted to the broadcast teams for their outstanding public service. \n \nDarro said that Niagara Falls residents had an easier time of it than those in Buffalo, because Mayor Michael C. O'Laughlin had declared a state of emergency in the early afternoon. Buffalo's mayor, Stan Makowski, waited until much later in the day and the newscaster said he believes that late declaration created additional problems for drivers and residents there. \n \nThe rule of thumb that day for Niagara residents was if you hadn't headed home by around 1 p.m., you probably should have decided where you'd spend the night. \n \nHarry Coppock of Lewiston, then a guidance counselor, decided he would drive over to Kenmore-West High School to pick up his paycheck. \"On the way back I realized it might be impossible to get across Grand Island, so near the south bridge approach I got off the I-190 and took River Road home,\" he said, \"It took me 1 1/2 hours!\" \n \nAt John's Motor Inn on Main Street, near the entrance to the Rainbow Bridge, one of the storm refuges kept leaving his fourth floor room to ride the hotel elevator to the basement garage. Other guests figured he was trying to start his car, but that didn't make sense in light of the driving ban throughout Niagara and Erie counties. Later, it was revealed the the frequent elevator rider was Chester Hardt, then chairman of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, who was using a mobile unit in his car to communicate with the Buffalo Niagara International Airport which the NFTA operates. \n \nGazette features editor Michele DeLuca contributed to this story.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DON GLYNN don.glynn@niagara-gazette.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Buffalo-Niagara Falls news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Weather news","group":"Science"}],"title":"Blizzard of '77: Frozen in memory","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Niagara","zipCode":"14302","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Niagara Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Niagara Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169790986","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Niagara Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.niagara-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203666196","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:33:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/niagara-gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/3e/c3e5f94e-0844-5701-93ea-b9d799e711fa/588d493a42543.image.jpg?resize=300%2C404"}],"video":[]}}

Berchelt forced the stoppage. He did the damage when it counted. That\u2019s all that matters, and that for 11 rounds; they gave us one hell of a fight. \n \nIn the co-feature, Takashi Miura (31-3-2, 24 KO) stopped Miguel Roman (56-12, 43 KO) in a slugfest.

But business is picking up. The company says it's on track to sell 6,000 more vehicles over the next year and expects to pass the 20,000 mark by the end of 2017. \n\nIt helps that all three major school bus manufacturers - Blue Bird, IC Bus, and Thomas Built Buses - offer propane-powered buses as an option to school districts, said Todd Mouw, vice president of sales and marketing for Roush CleanTech. \n\n\"That helps to legitimize the technology with the school districts,\" Mouw said. \"Instead of taking a year and a half to make a sale, it's taking months.\" \n\nThe idea to jump into the field of vehicles powered by alternative fuels came from Jack Roush, chairman of Roush Enterprises, and the company's top management team at a time when the company wanted to diversify its businesses beyond its core expertise of contract engineering, racing, and automotive performance parts. \n\nRoush formed a partnership with Ford for a 6.8-liter V-10 gasoline engine that it converts into an engine that can run on propane by installing up to 170 of its own components. Roush also landed a partnership with Blue Bird and ships the engines to the bus manufacturer's plant in Fort Valley, Ga. \n\nWaterford School District in suburban Detroit introduced 10 new school buses fueled by propane into its fleet last month. \n\n\"School buses operating on propane are environmentally friendly and reliable in cold weather conditions, plus offer cost-saving benefits,\" Keith Wunderlich, superintendent of Waterford schools, said in a statement. \n\nRoush began exploring a number of alternative fuels for bus and van transportation in 2008 in response to escalating gas and diesel prices. After an extensive review of possible fuels, the company concluded propane was a better choice than compressed natural gas even though such gas, often called CNG, has received a lot more media and industry attention. \n\nIn the U.S., there is a plentiful supply of propane, which is a derivative of natural gas. On a vehicle, CNG tanks must be larger and thicker than a propane tank because propane must be stored at a much higher pounds-per-square-inch measure, according to Natural Gas Vehicles for America. \n\nAlso, propane contains more than twice the usable energy content per cubic foot. Finally, it costs less to build propane autogas refueling stations and they use less electricity than CNG stations, Mouw said. \n\n\"It's cleaner than gasoline and diesel. We have a lot of it [in the U.S.], and we started to see that from a technical perspective it's easy to integrate into a Ford truck or a school bus,\" Mouw said. \n\nThere are more than 143,000 on-road propane vehicles in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy. That compares with about 153,000 vehicles powered by CNG that are on the road in America, according to Natural Gas for America.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brent Snavely"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Roush builds market for propane-powered vehicles","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203666941","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:33:28Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As interest rates rise, the cost of existing debt on credit cards and other variable-rate loans will go up too. \n\nBefore shopping for a new car, SUV or truck, it's becoming more important than ever to start out asking: What exactly can I afford? What's a reasonable monthly payment? What other costs do I need to consider? And, really, how long do I expect to hold onto that new vehicle? \n\n\"A lot of cars here today are 50 grand or more. Most people can't afford that,\" Ryan Fortenbacher, 35, said as he visited the North American International Auto Show in Detroit earlier this month. \"What you used to be able to get for $20,000 is now $30,000.\" \n\nFortenbacher, a real estate agent from Columbus, Ohio, said he and partner Mark Fischer pay $260 a month for a Volkswagen Jetta and $360 a month for a Toyota 4Runner. \n\nThe Toyota is a three-year lease, he said, because it would have cost nearly $700 a month on a five-year car loan for the $38,000 SUV. The Jetta has a 72-month loan at zero percent. \n\n\"If you asked me 10 years ago, I would never have done that,\" he said of the six-year car loan. \n\nOne risk of a lengthy loan is you can owe far more than the car is worth if you want to unload it before you pay it off. \n\nOn average, consumers are paying $495 a month for new-car loans, based on data for third quarter 2016, according to credit-reporting service Experian. That's up from $447 in 2008. By contrast, the average interest rate on a new-car loan was 6.14 percent in 2008, compared with 4.69 percent in 2016. \n\n\"We've seen a pretty sizable increase in monthly payments in the last eight years,\" said Melinda Zabritski, senior director for automotive finance for Experian. \n\nOn average, consumers financed $24,060 for a new car in 2008, compared with $30,022 in third quarter 2016, according to Experian's data. \n\nSome of the higher debt can be explained by higher sticker prices. Added technology drives up costs, too. The popularity of pickups and crossover utility vehicles also factors into bigger average payments. \n\nIn 2008, the No. 1 spot for new-car sales was small economy cars, Experian's Zabritski said. Now, the No. 1 spot is a more expensive, entry-level cross-over utility vehicle such as a Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V or Ford Escape, she said, followed by the pickup truck, then the economy car. \n\nThe average loan on an entry-level CUV was $25,966 from January through November 2016 - roughly $5,128 more than for a small economy car. The average loan on a full-sized pickup: $39,039. \n\nZabritski noted that the average new-car loan rate for a small economy car was 7.39 percent last year through November, reflecting a price point that attracts more subprime borrowers, who face higher interest rates due to bad credit. The average payment: $363 a month. \n\nThough many observers say the auto industry can keep selling at high levels or a slightly lower pace, some wonder if a roadblock is just ahead. \n\n\"We believe car affordability is holding new-car sales back,\" said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Autotrader. \n\nU.S. consumers bought a record 17.55 million new cars and trucks in 2016 - up from 17.47 million in 2015. But those sales are not that far off the old record level of 17.35 million sales hit in 2000. \n\nIf you look at the growth of the adult population, Krebs said, it's theoretically possible another 3 million units could have been sold in recent years. \n\nIn 2000, the U.S. had 210 million people over age 18. By 2015, the country had 248 million people over 18, she said. So, essentially it took 38 million more people to reach something close to 2000 levels. \n\n\"Why aren't we selling 20.5 million new vehicles?\" she asked. \"Affordability. In our recent survey of consumers, we asked: 'Why do you think you may not own or lease a new vehicle in the future?' Fifty-seven percent said they couldn't afford it.\" \n\nMany consumers stretch out loans or lease cars to keep a lower monthly payment. About 30 percent of new cars sold are leased, according to Experian. \n\nAbout 30.7 percent of new-car loans are for 73 to 84 months, it says, with about 40.7 percent for 61 to 72 months. \n\nOften, consumers don't bring much money to the table to buy a new car, financing 90 percent of their vehicles on average, said Paul Traub, senior business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's Detroit branch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susan Tompor"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"How much is too much for a car payment?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Philadelphia","zipCode":"19101","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Philadelphia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philly.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657485","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4851"},"name":"Philly.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://philly.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203667716","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
