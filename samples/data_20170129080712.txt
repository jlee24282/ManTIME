The family-owned Ponti's has restaurants in London and at Fox Valley in north Sheffield and the new Gainsborough restaurant will be the team's first venture in Lincolnshire and the East Midlands.\n\nPonti's boasts traditional ingredients in its cooking and set menus start from £16. It offers pizza, pasta as well as meat and fish dishes.\n\nDevelopers Dransfield Properties held a public feedback event in the town and say the vast majority of people attending were behind the proposals.\n\n\"We had an extremely positive response to the plans. Looking at the feedback forms 96% were in favour of the development plans,\" said Amanda Holmes, communications director at Dransfield Properties.\n\n\"We had 95 forms filled in and 91 indicated they were in favour of the plans.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2541","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Nowra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"South Coast Register","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"345131379","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"South Coast Register","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.southcoastregister.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194985269","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

executives and prominent business leaders signed up to advise President Donald Trump. But only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick have so far had the gumption to speak out against the president\u2019s executive order blocking refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \n \nThe order, issued Friday, sparked protests at airports across the nation. By Saturday, a federal judge in Brooklyn had temporarily blocked parts of it. \n \nChief executives of large corporations are nearly universal in their support for increased immigration. It\u2019s hard to imagine that any CEO on Trump\u2019s advisory panel supports a ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries in principle. \n \nBut Trump\u2019s power and the allure of the presidency are apparently enough to cower the corporate chiefs into staying silent on matters of law and fundamental American values. \n \nMusk and Kalanick may have been emboldened by fellow Silicon Valley CEOs, including Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who were blasting Trump\u2019s ban. Immigration is particularly important in the tech sector, which often looks outside the country to hire talent. \n \n\u201cThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges,\u201d Musk tweeted Saturday night, using the sort of mild language that counts for aggressive in the corporate world. Just days earlier, The New York Times reported that Musk and Trump having a \u201cbudding bromance.\u201d \n \nThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges \n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 \nTesla employs a small number of people potentially affected by the ban. But the company does not believe any employees are being detained, a source familiar with the company told HuffPost. Tesla\u2019s HR and legal teams are working with the employees who may be affected, the source said. \n \nKalanick, who\u2019s faced criticism for his role advising Trump, offered a more detailed response. In an email to Uber employees with the subject line \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d the chief executive said he plans to raise the issue with Trump at the advisory board\u2019s first meeting on Friday. \n \n\u201cWhile every government has their own immigration controls,\u201d Kalanick wrote in the note, which he also posted to Facebook, \u201callowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.\u2019s policy since its founding.\u201d \n \nKalanick said the order would have far-reaching effects at his ride-sharing company. A dozen or so Uber employees are legal residents but not naturalized citizens, and they may not be able to get back to the U.S. if they travel abroad. And thousands of drivers, who are not technically employed by Uber, may not be able to get back in the country for 90 days. \n \n\u201cThat means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families\u2014and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time,\u201d he wrote. \n \nThe CEO said Uber would compensate these drivers \u201cpro bono\u201d over the next three months to help them, with more details to come.  \n \nOther companies whose CEOs are serving on Trump\u2019s advisory council, including J.P. Morgan, Disney, Walmart, IBM, General Electric, General Motors and Blackstone, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Consulting firm Ernst & Young declined to comment on Trump\u2019s policies when asked earlier this week. And Boston Consulting Group, whose CEO Rich Lesser is on the council, told HuffPost that he is serving in that role as an individual, not as a representative of the consulting firm. \n \nMeanwhile, a virtual who\u2019s who of tech CEOs ? those not on Trump\u2019s advisory board ? came out swinging on Saturday against the ban.  \n \nApple CEO Tim Cook told his employees that the company had already reached out to the White House to explain how bad this order is for employees, according to an internal email obtained by HuffPost. \n \n \u201cThere are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday\u2019s immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them,\u201d Cook wrote. \n \nEarlier this week, Cook reportedly had dinner with Trump adviser (and son-in-law) Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump. \n \n\u201cApple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,\u201d Cook wrote in his note. \n \nSteve Jobs, the founder of Apple, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Syria is one of the countries targeted by Trump\u2019s travel ban. \n \nOther tech CEOs spoke out against the order on various social media platforms. \n \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings posted a Facebook message that said, \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.\u201d \n \n\u201cWorse,\u201d he added, \u201cthese actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe.\u201d \n \nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who was snubbed from a recent meeting between Trump and other tech bigwigs, tweeted his disapproval Saturday night.  \n \nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. https://t.co/HdwVGzIECt \n\u2014 jack (@jack) January 28, 2017 \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was born in India, offered up a more personal criticism in a post on LInkedIn. \u201cAs an immigrant and as a CEO, I\u2019ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\u201d she wrote. \n \nAt least 76 Microsoft employees have visas from the six countries listed in the ban, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote in an email to employees. The company is advocating against the policy. \n \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos hasn\u2019t commented, but in an email sent to employees on Saturday, the company\u2019s head of human resources offered workers information on how to handle the new immigration policies, while also affirming its commitment to diversity. \n \n\u201cFrom the very beginning, Amazon has been committed to equal rights, tolerance and diversity\u2014and we always will be,\u201d HR Vice President Beth Galetti wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to attract talented people from all over the world, and we believe this is one of the things that makes Amazon great\u2014a diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers.\u201d \n \nAlso on Saturday, Google recalled staff to the U.S. because of the Trump order. CEO Sundar Pichai, also born in India, slammed the administration\u2019s move in an email obtained by Bloomberg. \n \nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Since wala pa si Alyssa ITC because she is new eh, ngayon lang siya magka-club, so pag ganoon ire-request nila (club team) sa NSA -- LVPI vice president Peter Cayco on Alyssa Valdez's delayed ITC release \n  \nLarong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. vice president Peter Cayco clarified that there was a miscommunication in the process of acquiring an international transfer certificate (ITC) that delayed Filipina superstar Alyssa Valdez's clearance to play in the Thai League Sunday afternoon. \n \nThe sports association came under fire Saturday following the reports that Valdez still has to receive her ITC to be able to suit up for 3BB Nakornnont in her debut game against King-Bangkok. \n \nIn a late report, Valdez received her ITC and was cleared to play. \n \nCayco was on the receiving end of criticism from volleyball fans, citing reports pointing that LVPI failed to register Valdez for an ITC. \n \nHe clarified that they did their part in giving the former three-time UAAP Most Valuable Player the go-signal to play in Thailand, adding that since Valdez is just applying for a new ITC the process of obtaining one falls on the side of 3BB Nakornnont.  \n \nCayco and Valdez met at the LVPI office in Arellano University in Taft Avenue last January 14 before she left for Thailand the day after.     \n \n\u201cYes, sila (club team) ang magre-request \u2018di ba? Since wala pa si Alyssa ITC because she is new eh, ngayon lang siya magka-club, so pag ganoon ire-request nila (club team) sa NSA,\u201d he explained Saturday during the national team tryouts. \u201cSo binigyan ko sila ng clearance, she\u2019s clear to play. Ang kuwan ko lang, kami (LVPI) daw ang humingi ng ITC dapat nga sila \u2018yung requesting club. Wala pa sayang previous ITC so what should have be done was kuha sila ng clearance sa amin, which I already gave.\u201d \n \n\u201cActually three letters na ang pinapadala ko. We met lang kasi the day before she left so after she left siguro after two days nagpadala na ako ng letter, then I sent a second letter and finally I sent a third letter on Friday that she\u2019s cleared to play,\u201d he continued. \u201cDapat sila na ang nagpa-process niyan eh. Kasi it\u2019s a new ITC and if it\u2019s new, club to NSA (dapat) it\u2019s not club to club kaya mas simple.\u201d \n \nCayco said that LVPI already cleared Valdez to play in Thailand, a historic feat for a Filipina spiker. \n \n\u201cEh ni-release ko na siya eh so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d Cayco said. \u201cThat paper was Alyssa\u2019s letter to LVPI asking that she may be permitted to play so sinagot ko, after two days may sagot na ako doon, naka-CC, copy furnish si Alyssa. Siguradong maga-grant (ang request), ang sa akin lang na-late lang kasi sila tapos sasabihin bakit hindi pina-process.\u201d \n \nValdez trained for two weeks with the team but failed to send Cayco a copy of her contract and passport \u2013 the required documents needed by FIVB to process the ITC. \n \nLVPI received a copy of the contract just last Friday. \n \n\u201cI have (now) the records with me. I have been asking Alyssa to email me kasi she left na rin \u2018di ba? Before she left, she visited me here on Saturday, so I told her, Alyssa here\u2019s my email add send me a copy of your passport and your contract,\u201d Cayco said. \u201cBut it did not come, kinulit ko na lang siya, sabi ko please send me (the documents).\u201d \n \nCayco said that he sought the help of LVPI secretary general Ricky Palou to contact Valdez for the required documents but the former Ateneo de Manila athletics director told him that a contract in not necessary to acquire an ITC.    \n \n\u201cI asked Mr. Palou to help me get in touch with Alyssa so they sent me a copy of the passport. So ang hinihingi ng FIVB is the copy of the passport and the copy of the contract and he (Palou) told me they (FIVB) don\u2019t need the copy of the contract. I told him that\u2019s what they\u2019 re asking so I might as well give it kasi I cannot tell them naman na, \u2018huwag na \u2018yan\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo finally, I went direct to her club, I wrote them I think twice or thrice. Friday noon they sent me a copy of the contract signed by Alyssa Valdez so now I have with me a copy of her contract and a copy of her passport and yesterday (Saturday) I sent it immediately na to FIVB. Ang problema, Friday (nagsend ng contract) I just hope na process na nila. I was trying to call them Saturday mga noon time, I was getting the answering machine of the FIVB, so hopefully sana ma-process agad.\u201d \n \n\u201cPero I wrote TVA (Thailand Volleyball Association) and AVC and her club stating that the LVPI imposes no objection to the playing of Alyssa Valdez in Thailand from the period covered and she is cleared to play, it\u2019s just that the LVPI is still awaiting for the ITC,\u201d said Cayco. \n \n--- \n \nFollow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: volleyball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Volleyball Miscommunication in the process delays Valdez's ITC","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"PH","country":"Philippines"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ABS-CBN SPORTS","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"553774679","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4051"},"name":"ABS-CBN SPORTS","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Volleyball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://sports.abs-cbn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194986094","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

After lobbying his bosses at 2GB, Price is headed to the jungle for season three of Channel Ten's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\n\nAccording to the talkback star, there's more to life than just politics, and a jungle camp with nine other celebrities just might be the change he needs. \"I think doing the job that I do, particularly radio but also on The Project, it's dependent on having interesting things to talk about. If you lead a boring, protected life, you don't have as much to talk about,\" he says.\n\nSigning on to the show was a \"pretty tough\" decision \u2013 while providing some convenient cross-promotion for Ten \u2013 but Price says it was an opportunity too good to pass up. \"I explained to them I thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take you out of your comfort zone.\n\n\"I had to convince the people who pay me to let me go for an unspecified period of time, which is pretty unfair on them. No one at work knows except the executive chairman.\" Alongside Price will be former Olympic swimmer Lisa Curry, 54, an accomplished athlete with 15 gold medals under her belt. \n\nPrice is used to people challenging his politics on The Project, but how will he go spending up to six weeks with celebrities from across the political divide? \"Clearly, the producers of the program are going to put people in that create some sort of conflict, but I don't have to apologise for or explain my views,\" he says. \"I don't want to bore everyone at 7.30 at night by giving a political lesson, though. The different side they'll see of me is that I want to talk about more interesting things than politics.\n\n\"I'm paid to, and have for a long time managed to get people to tell me things about them, and that's what I'm hopefully going to do with these other nine people. \"Being in a confined environment with nine people you probably don't know for up to six weeks, you've got to make it interesting, not just for the viewer, but for you in there.\"\n\nThe thing he dreads the most? Not being in control.\n\n\"I'm going to be wanting to be in charge but there will be other personalities within this group who won't want me to be in charge. They'll want me to just be one of the group. That's going to be a difficult thing for me because I like to run things.\"\n\nAs one of the oldest celebrities this year, Price knows the experience will be no cakewalk but is pushing ahead regardless.\n\n\"I deliberately didn't want to watch the show because I don't think I would have done it. If I'd done that I would have said no, I think.\n\n\"So I'm going in thinking, 'Oh well, I've got a few weeks off work, I'm hanging out in the African jungle'.\"\n\nThis journalist travelled to South Africa as a guest of Channel Ten.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ebony Bowden"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Welcome to the jungle: Steve Price hasn't seen TV show he's on","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Television","Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/@ebonybowden","https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Ftv-and-radio%2Fsteve-price-heads-into-the-jungle-for-im-a-celebrityget-me-out-of-here-20170128-gu0l6n.html&title=Steve+Price+heads+into+the+jungle+for+I%2","https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Ftv-and-radio%2Fsteve-price-heads-into-the-jungle-for-im-a-celebrityget-me-out-of-here-20170128-gu0l6n.html&text=Steve+Price+heads+into+the+jungle+for+I%27m+a+Celebrity..","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Ftv-and-radio%2Fsteve-price-heads-into-the-jungle-for-im-a-celebrityget-me-out-of-here-20170128-gu0l6n.html&title=Steve+Price+heads+into+the+jungle+for+I%27m+a+Celebr","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Ftv-and-radio%2Fsteve-price-heads-into-the-jungle-for-im-a-celebrityget-me-out-of-here-20170128-gu0l6n.html&title=Steve+Price+heads+into+the+jungle+f","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Ftv-and-radio%2Fsteve-price-heads-into-the-jungle-for-im-a-celebrityget-me-out-of-here-20170128-gu0l6n.html&title=Steve+Price+heads+into+the+jungle+for+I%27m+a+Celebri","http://www.facebook.com/spectrumaust","https://twitter.com/TheAgeEntertain","http://www.facebook.com/brisbanetimes","https://twitter.com/brisbanetimes"],"sequenceId":"695194989261","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T21:39:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/u/0/m/y/7/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gu0l6n.png/1485639579046.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

SPU's Olivier-Paul Betu missed a finger-roll layup at the buzzer on the other end. \n   \n\"It was a very good win against a very good offensive team,\" UAA coach Rusty Osborne said by text. \"Both Suki (Wiggs) and Diante made big plays at the end of overtime and that's what you expect from your seniors.\" \n   \nThe Seawolves (15-5, 9-3 Great Northwest Athletic Conference) hovered around a 10-point lead for most of the game, but the Falcons slowly chipped away at UAA's lead in the second half. SPU (9-11, 5-7) took its first lead of the game with just under four minutes remaining on a pair of Khan free throw that made it 59-58. \n   \nUAA regained the lead on a Connor Devine layup on the other end. The lead changed six times in the final four minutes of regulation. \n   \nUAA took a three-point lead on a pair of Mitchell free throws with seven seconds remaining \u2014 he made four free throws in the final 30 seconds \u2014 but SPU had a chance to tie the game, down 71-68. \n   \nSPU's Coleman Wooten drove the baseline and dished the ball out to Khan, who sank a fadeaway 3 to send the game to overtime. \n   \n\"We did a great job defensively in the first half but we made some mistakes in the second half that allowed them to get going,\" Osborne said. \"We weighed whether to foul or not at the end of regulation, but decided to play it straight up. Credit to them for hitting a fadeway contested 3 by a young man shooting 27 percent for the season.\" \n   \nThe Falcons went up early in overtime when Wooten hit a trey in a 4-on-5 situation with Mitchell down on the court after taking a hard fall. But UAA stayed close and retook the lead for the final time on Mitchell's layup with 4.8 seconds to go. \n   \nWiggs scored a game-high 34 points on 13 of 27 shooting from the field. Mitchell racked up 16 points and went 8 of 8 from the line and Senior guard Spencer Svejcar added 15 points. \n   \nBoth teams endured foul trouble throughout the game. Devine and Svejcar played limited minutes in the second half for UAA and SPU's leading scorers \u2014 Tony Miller (29 points) and Wooten (14) \u2014 both fouled out. \n   \n\"I am proud that we were able to fight through some foul trouble,\" Osborne said. \"Connor barely played in the second half and Spencer had to sit a long time in the second.

I want to know if my congressman, Rodney Frelinghuysen, will represent a more moderate voice. I recently called his office and the conversation went like this: \n \nMe: Hi, I\u2019m a constituent and I would like to know when the Congressman is holding his next town hall. \n \nAnswer: He has them by phone now. \n \nMe: OK, how do I sign up? \n \nAnswer: You can\u2019t. It\u2019s random. \n \nMe: Then how do I know when they are happening? \n \nAnswer: You don\u2019t. No one does. \n \nMe: Sorry, I\u2019m confused. \n \nAnswer: That\u2019s how it is. \n \nI later learned this is an accurate description of \u201cRobo Town Halls\u201d; unsolicited, random calls at unannounced times designed to replace and avoid face-to-face meetings between real live people. \n \nFor the record, if I could meet Congressman Frelinghuysen at a local town hall, I would ask him four questions: \n \n\u2022 Will he clearly explain how the Affordable Care Act will be replaced? \n \nPeople deserve to hear a plan. \n \n\u2022 Will he disavow Republican tax policies that favor the wealthiest 1 percent and harm the citizens of New Jersey compared to citizens in states like Texas and Indiana? \n \n\u2022 Will he protect women\u2019s health and reproductive rights, an issue he had long supported until recently, by allowing Planned Parenthood to be reimbursed by Medicaid for Pap smears and contraception? \n \n\u2022 And finally, will he promise to prioritize funding for a tunnel between New Jersey and New York City before any funding for a border wall in the South? Our transit situation is getting desperate and must be addressed urgently. \n \nI don\u2019t expect to be called to attend a \u201crobo town hall\u201d and I would probably be working anyway.

In Plymouth, we're in a really good place.\" \n \nMr Corbyn has instructed his MPs to vote for a Bill on triggering Article 50; several have already resigned from the shadow cabinet in protest. \n \nCllr Evans still believes the UK should stay in Europe, and admits the vote will \"put people in conflict\". \n \nIf he were in the House of Commons, how would he vote? \n \n\"That's a really difficult question to answer,\" he says. \n \n\"The question on the referendum was 'Do you want to leave the European Union?' \n \n\"Most people in Plymouth said they would like to leave. But I talk to people now who say 'I didn't realise it means tariffs going up and blah, blah, blah. \n \n\"It would depend what the question is. The question is not as straightforward as they're trying to make out.\" \n \nREAD MORE:  'Centre-left alliance' could challenge Tory-UKIP council in Plymouth \n  \nNext question: 'When did you last borrow a book from a library?' \n \n\"Oh gosh, a long time ago,\" Cllr Evans says. \n \n\"Probably when I was a kid, if I'm honest. \n \n\"I go into the library because there are other things happening.\" \n \nThe council is proposing to close ten of the city's most \"under-used\" libraries , and Labour are campaigning hard against it. \n \nIf he was still in power, would he keep all 17 libraries open? \n \n\"We had begun to talk about a transformation programme,\" he says. \n \n\"We thought we could change the way we were doing it. We could move libraries rather than closing them. \n \n\"Like North Prospect which was in a bad location, with an old and tired offer, move it up the road and reimagine it, and you've got a success story on your hands. \n \n\"This is different. Proposing to close 60 per cent of the library network in one go is not a transformation programme. It's barbaric. We wouldn't be doing it like this.\" \n \nREAD MORE:  Plymouth library closures must be scrutinised, say opponents \n  \nFour years ago, Labour had a six-seat majority over the Conservatives. \n \nThat lead has slowly eroded, to the point where last year the parties ended dead level and the Tories took the chance to form a coalition with UKIP. \n \nA reader asks: 'What will Labour do to return to power in 2018?' \n \n\"The manifesto we prepared for last year's election needs looking at,\" Cllr Evans says. \n \n\"What we normally do is have a series of conversations with the public, with party members, with stakeholders, with people in the community to try to imagine a programme that will excite, amaze and entertain, and also be popular.\" \n \nIs a re-think required to regain control? \n \n\"We know what we've got to do,\" he says. \n \n\"We've got to defend what we've got and take back a couple of seats. If we want a working majority, we've got to take a couple more. \n \n\"But with elections in thirds, there are only so many places that can happen. \n \n\"The task is always difficult, but it's over a year away. A lot can happen in a year in politics.\" \n \nREAD MORE:  Labour dismisses talk of teaming up with rivals to take on Plymouth 'Blukip' regime \n  \nBack to Westminster for the next question, which will surely resonate with many traditional Labour voters across the city: 'How do you plan to sell the far-left policies of your leader to middle-income earners?' \n \nCllr Evans is clearly uncomfortable talking about Mr Corbyn. \n \n\"The national stuff is the job of...we don't do that,\" he says. \n \n\"The Labour Party operates in a different way from other political parties. \n \n\"For example, the Labour Party wouldn't tell us how to sell the local manifesto to the community. Wouldn't design the campaign, wouldn't interfere. \n \n\"The national stuff is handed down, like national campaign days. The Labour Party will send us materials. \n \n\"It isn't a question of how we would sell anything. We do our own local programme.\" \n \nHe is distancing himself from Mr Corbyn, but the fact remains people vote in local elections based on how the party appears in the media. Doesn't that cause a conflict? \n\n \n\"You're quite right,\" he says. \n \n\"A lot of people's voting behaviour is determined by what goes on nationally. Local government never gets on the television. \n \n\"But we're still spending £200million of local taxpayers' money on local services. That is nothing to do with Westminster. How we spend that money is entirely determined by us down here.\" \n \nWhen Labour is out canvassing for support, how many residents say they can no longer support Labour because of Mr Corbyn's views? \n \n\"Very few people actually cite the leader as an issue on the doorstep,\" Cllr Evans says. \n \n\"I can tell you, hand on heart, they used to complain to me about Kinnock, they used to complain to me about Miliband, Brown and Blair. They always have. \n \n\"If they don't want to vote for you, they will always find a reason. There's no point in arguing about that. I don't think unlikeability is unique to Jeremy Corbyn.\" \n \nREAD MORE:  Council to spend £250,000 refurbishing its chamber \n  \nSpeaking of which, when Donald Trump was elected President of the USA, Tory leader Ian Bowyer invited him to Plymouth to celebrate the Mayflower anniversary in 2020. \n\n \nIf Cllr Evans is in charge by then, will he stand on the Mayflower Steps and shake President Trump's hand? \n \n\"That's a very good question,\" he smiles. \n \n\"I'd probably leave it to the Lord Mayor. \n \n\"I don't think he's going to have a very successful Presidency, and a number of people who voted for him will very shortly discover that a lot of the promises he made to them will not materialise.\" \n \nWe take a quick whip through the rest of the questions. \n \n'I voted remain and believe Brexit will be a disaster for the UK. Should I vote Lib Dem?' \n \n\"No. No, no, no. I don't think you should do that,\" he says. \n \n\"The reason we had the referendum was the Lib Dems propped up the Tory government. \n \n\"If they hadn't done that, there wouldn't have been David Cameron and there wouldn't have been a Brexit vote.\" \n \n'Do you regret the decision to give the lease on the airport to Sutton Harbour Holdings?' \n \n\"The thing is, 12 years ago Plymouth was a few hours away from not having an airport at all,\" he says. \n \n\"So I saved the airport. Sutton Harbour Holdings then is a different beast to the company now. None of the personalities are the same. \n \n\"The point is we had an airport for nearly 10 years longer than we might otherwise have had if that had not been done. \n \n\"The deal was negotiated by my predecessor and officers who are no longer here. When I took over in May 2007, I was given a final sign-off on the deal with Sutton Harbour. \n \n\"So basically, I signed the deal. I think I will always have the blame, but I'll never get the credit for taking that decision to keep it open.\" \n \nREAD MORE:  Work on new five-star Plymouth hotel to start within months \n  \n'Given your party's opposition to cuts, what would you do to address the £40million budget shortfall over the next three years?' \n\n \nCllr Evans points out his \"three-pronged programme\" \u2013 transformation, growth and stopping services as a last resort \u2013 saved £65million from 2012 to 2016. \n \nDoes he think Labour would be able to balance the books without cutting public services? \n \n\"No, I don't. I think it would be incredible to say you could do it without any cuts. What bothers me is that Ian Bowyer has blamed my finance person, and then blamed the Government. \n \n\"I'm sure at some point he's going to man up and take some responsibility.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate.

\n \n\u201cI think I will be able to get close so we will see,\u201d said Rosenberg, who is 46 years old.  \u201cNo sense in setting a goal if it is easy to get.\u201d \n \nSide note:   Rosenberg\u2019s story that was published here last Sunday was picked up by the internet sites Let\u2019s Run and Bring Back the Mile, garnering more attention for his streak. \n Race Results can often be found at www.compuscore.com or at  www.bestrace.com   A calendar of USATF sanctioned events can be found at www.usatfnj.org or at www.raceforum.com for running and tri and biathlon events.  \nContact Madeline Bost at madelinebost@verizon.net","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Madeline Bost, Columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Get ready to run in Morristown on Super Sunday","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morris","zipCode":"07054","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parsippany","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Morris County Daily Record","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669560","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"102"},"name":"Morris County Daily Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyrecord.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2016/09/10/Morristown/B9323764147Z.1_20160910233118_000_GHNFM58PM.1-0.jpg"],"sequenceId":"695195001753","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:52Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2016/09/10/Morristown/B9323764147Z.1_20160910233118_000_GHNFM58PM.1-0.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He was assisted by winger Tyler Ruegsegger. \n   \nAfter falling behind 2-0 in the first period both Wednesday and Friday, the Aces turned the tables Saturday, when they used first-period goals 90 seconds apart from Tim Wallace and Tim Coffman to seize a 2-0 lead. \n   \nWallace was left with a virtual tap-in when Stephen Perfetto beat Jefferson Dahl on a left-wing face-off, tapping the puck through Dahl's legs and back-handing a pass to Wallace at the net. \n   \nCoffman struck when he took a breakout pass from defenseman Dax Lauwers in neutral ice, blew into Idaho's zone on left wing, cut to the middle, faked a shot and then unloaded a slot wrister past Komm. \n   \nThe Aces outshot the Steelheads 18-7 in the opening 20 minutes. \n   \nThe Steelheads, who because of injuries and a call-up to the American Hockey League played with 14 skaters, two shy of the maximum allowed, did not remotely take the night off. They played hard and physical in the second period and trimmed Alaska's lead to 2-1, in part because the Aces furnished the Steelheads three consecutive power plays in a span of about five minutes. \n   \nIdaho, which entered the evening with the circuit's third-best power play, cashed in on the final of those chances. Will Merchant's bid from the slot was a high tumbler that was blocked back to him. On his second whack at a bouncing puck in the low slot, he rifled a shot through traffic and past Carr. \n   \nThe Aces next play a three-game series at Colorado that opens Wednesday. Murray will rejoin the club in Colorado.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Doyle Woody"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Aces blow early two-goal lead, persevere for 3-2 OT win on Descoteaux strike","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anchorage","zipCode":"99508","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anchorage","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Anchorage Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666318","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"150"},"name":"Anchorage Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.adn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195003443","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In his Walkill Valley Regional High School League, he was put on the varsity bowling team in his freshman year. \n \nMore recently, though, he has had coaching sessions by PBA Hall of Famer Teata Semiz at Sparta Lanes. \u201cHe taught me everything. I watched some YouTube videos with him, then I kept practicing and practicing to get better.\u201d \n \nAnd now, in the Thursday Night Mixed League at Sparta Lanes, he rolled 234-203-300 for a 737. It should be noted that he also rolled back-to-back 279s for his high of 780 the previous week. For perfection, he used a Storm Punch Out drilled by Phil Rapavi of the former Precision Fit Pro Shop at Circle Lanes. \n \nWas he nervous? \u201cMy friends said that I was shaking, so I was a little nervous at first. Generally, though, I don\u2019t get nervous. The (12th) shot was clean off my hand and boom, was there. I stay focused and consistent.  That\u2019s how you can be a good bowler.\u201d \n \nHe will be bowling in the upcoming Masters tournament at Sparta and hopes to do well. His Thursday and Friday leagues will provide some good practice before the Feb. 12 tournament. \n \nHe dedicated his 300 to \u201cmy mother, Valeire, because she got me into bowling so that I could make friends. She is an amazing mother. I also thank Teata for all of his coaching and my other coach, Kaitlyn Egan. They are both awesome bowlers and without them I probably wouldn\u2019t be bowling.\u201d He also cited Tink Washer for letting this writer know about his achievement. \n \nSpeaking of Washer, Tink saw his 23rd perfect game, this in the Thursday Night Mixed League at Sparta Lanes.  He used a DV8 Grudge Hybrid drilled by Tom Laskow of the Pro Edge Pro Shop. He was subbing in the league and posted 247-235-300 for 782. \n \nThe Professional Bowlers Association bowling community as well as the University of Akron (OH) and many more mourn the loss of Margaret \u201cPeggy\u201d Elias, widow of PBA founder Eddie Elias, who passed on January 24th. This former Miss Ohio went from being a beauty queen, model and performer to being a wife and mother. I was fortunate to have met her at my first and subsequent Firestone Tournaments of Champions. She asked me to take a photo of her with Eddie at our \u201ccelebrity\u201d pro-am following the victory banquet. This was before cell phones and selfies.  I was at her table at the PBA 50 banquet and you would never know who she was, and all she had achieved, even after her husband\u2019s death. Peggy was kind to everybody and anybody. \n \nShe was instrumental in creating the Edward G. Elias Bowling Center at the University of Akron (OH). The annual college bowling Tournament is the country\u2019s only collegiate bowling competition that offers cash prizes toward tuition. \u201cIn lieu of flowers, Peggy hopes you will consider helping young people with a gift to the Edward G. Elias Bowling Tournament at www.uakron.edu/donate or with a donation to St. Jude\u2019s at www.stjude.org/give.\u201d Today, the wake will be in Fairlawn OH from 6-8 p.m. with services tomorrow at the Faith Lutheran church in Fairlawn. Condolences may be expressed at www.catavolosfuneralhome.com. \n \nA big \u201cshout out\u201d goes to Daily Record photographer Bob Karp and journalist Jane Havsy for covering the high school tournament at Rockaway Lanes. Highlights included: Erik Kattermann, 300 (last year he rolled a 299 in the same tournament); other high games were posted by Alex Groomey, 259 and Matt Marietta, 247. For the girls it was Lauren Marks, 249 (old record was 247), Paige Piombino, 212 and Emma Thies, 212. Montville won the team event with 1140. High series: Erik Kattermann, 813 (old record was his at 790), Matt Marietta, 696 and Peter Ho, 685. Girls: Lauren Marks, 581, Rhianna Smith, 571, and Emma Thies, 566. Team high series: Montville, 3186 (besting their record of 3174). \n \nDid you know?  The New Jersey State USBC Bowling Association awards the annual Donald M. Roberts Memorial Scholarship.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2632","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bombala","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bombala Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675028","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Bombala Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bombalatimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195004153","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Ryan's defense and McConnell's silence, some critics said, amounted to a moral failing that made them complicit in a humanitarian crisis. \n   \n\"To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on Twitter along with the famous image of a toddler boy who had died in 2015 while his family fled Syria and whose body had washed up on Turkey's shore. \n   \nThe order blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya from entering the country for at least 90 days. It also bans refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days \u2013 and from Syria indefinitely. Trump said the goal is to screen out \"radical Islamic terrorists\" and to give priority for admission to Christians. \n   \nRepublicans defending the executive order pointed to an exception for people already in transit and argued that some elements, including the religious minority preference, would not immediately be implemented. But as cable news footage brought scenes Saturday of chaos at airports around the country, where business travelers, students and even legal U.S. residents were being barred entry, other Republicans began weighing in. \n   \n\"This is ridiculous,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. \"I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.\" \n   \nDent, who represents a large Syrian community in the Allentown area, said he was contacted Saturday by a constituent whose family members were turned away early in the morning at Philadelphia International Airport. Six family members who had secured visas and even bought a house in Pennsylvania arrived on a Qatar Airways flight but were turned back within hours, he said. \n   \nDent called on the Trump administration to immediately halt action on the order. \n   \n\"This family was sent home despite having all their paperwork in order,\" Dent said. \"So this 90-day ban could imperil the lives of this family and potentially others, and it's unacceptable, and I urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be reinstated.\" \n   \nSome conservatives worried that denying entry to permanent residents and green-card holders could violate the Constitution. Many worried privately that the order will face significant challenges in court. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., was among the few GOP members to air his concerns publicly. Amash posted on Twitter that the order \"overreaches\" and \"undermines\" the Constitution. \n   \n\"It's not lawful to ban immigrants on basis of nationality,\" he tweeted. \"If the president wants to change immigration law, he must work with Congress.\" \n   \nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., credited Trump with properly focusing on protecting the country's borders and said it is necessary to connect \"jihadi terrorism\" with Islam and particular countries. However, he also noted that the order is \"too broad.\" \n   \n\"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\" Sasse said. \"Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\" \n   \nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he has \"technical\" questions about how the order will be implemented but supports its purpose. \n   \nThe statement from Ryan's office came after several requests seeking comment on how the order differs from the Muslim ban that Ryan rejected during the campaign, whether such a ban is in line with American values and if Ryan is concerned that the order is a first step toward a religious litmus test. \n   \nRyan has been a consistent advocate for increased vetting standards and has frequently said he opposes a complete ban on Muslims entering the country. \n   \n\"Freedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional principle. It's a founding principle of this country,\" Ryan told reporters following a closed-door morning meeting at the Republican National Committee in December 2015. \"This is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it's not what this country stands for.\" \n   \nThe majority of Republicans in Congress were silent on the order Saturday \u2013 including McConnell. Calls and emails to more than a dozen top GOP lawmakers were not returned. \n   \nConservative advocacy groups, meanwhile, generally supported Trump's actions. \n   \nIn an interview Saturday with The Washington Post, Faith and Freedom Coalition chairman Ralph Reed defended Trump's executive order, calling it an \"entirely prudent move\" and rejecting the notion that it amounts to a ban on Muslims or infringes on religious liberties. \n   \n\"It makes perfect sense not to try to build the airplane in the air,\" said Reed, who advocated hitting \"the pause button\" on current practices on immigration and refugee policies, over concerns about terrorism. \n   \nCongressional aides who did respond generally insisted that Trump was merely adopting a policy that passed the House last year with a veto-proof majority. The seven countries named in the order are currently included in the list of as \"countries of concern\" by the Department of Homeland Security. People who have traveled to or lived in those countries were already subject to additional scrutiny when applying for visa waivers. \n   \nOne senior GOP aide said in an email that the executive order was \"narrow, a faint shadow of the policy Trump ran on.\" And several congressional aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the executive order itself does not single out a preference for Christians, and the temporary travel ban is focused on areas where terrorism is a particular concern. \n   \nConfusion over the directive played out at airports across the country as immigration officials attempted to decide how to handle refugees and travelers from those seven nations who were already in transit or on the ground when the executive order was issued. \n   \nSeveral news outlets reported instances of travelers being detained in airports, including Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Iraqi man who spent several years acting as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq. Darweesh was released from detention in New York's John F. Kennedy airport after two New York Democrats, Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velázquez, intervened on his behalf. \n   \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward Royce, R-Calif., said Saturday that he backs the order but hopes for some resolution for those in transit as the order was announced. \n   \n\"Pausing the intake of refugees from terror hot spots is the right call to keep America safe,\" Royce said. \"I hope cases of individuals with visas traveling as this executive action went into effect \u2013 including some who served alongside U.S. troops \u2013 will be resolved quickly.\" \n   \nThe House voted last year on legislation to suspend the admission of refugees from Syria and Iraq until the White House could certify that no person entering the United States would pose a security threat. Democrats blocked a vote on the legislation in the Senate, and it ultimately failed to reach President Barack Obama's desk. \n   \nAides also said it is not uncommon for an administration to prioritize refugee requests on the basis of religious persecution. However, since the beginning of the Syrian civil war and the rise of the Islamic State, many more Muslims than Christians have been killed or displaced because of the violence. \n   \nRyan said Friday that while he supports the refugee resettlement program, he thinks it is time to \"reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process.\" \n   \n\"President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country,\" the speaker said Friday. \n   \nOther Republicans offered similar support for the order on national security grounds. \n   \n\"President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States,\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said in a statement. \"With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last Administration did in eight years.\" \n   \nEvan McMullin, a former CIA officer and House GOP policy director who waged an independent presidential bid in 2016, was one of a small number of Republicans to publicly oppose the ban. McMullin tweeted a photo of the Statue of Liberty on Saturday morning, and was promptly mocked by the white nationalist Richard Spencer. \n   \n\"That's who they're in league with \u2013 white supremacists and white nationalists,\" McMullin said in an interview. \"I'm not expecting much opposition from the vast majority of Republicans in Congress. There is anti-Muslim bigotry at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and it is fundamentally un-American and tangibly damaging to our national security and strength.\" \n   \nMost Republicans, McMullin predicted, would decline to criticize the executive orders. \"Those who are silent on this will be defined by that silence,\" he said. \n   \n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n   \nThe Washington Post's Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Some Republicans decry Trump's travel ban, others defend it","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anchorage","zipCode":"99508","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anchorage","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Anchorage Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666318","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"150"},"name":"Anchorage Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.adn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195004447","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A major generator of Victoria's coal-fired electricity is set to be expanded, sparking protests from environment groups over the effect on carbon emissions.\n\nThe planned upgrade of the Loy Yang B power station in the Latrobe Valley comes as its majority owner, Engie, prepares to shut down the Hazelwood plant and coal mine in March.\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted \"works approval\" to upgrade turbines at the plant, which will result in the burning of an extra 400,000 tonnes of coal each year.\n\nLoy Yang B provides about 17 per cent of Victoria's energy needs.\n\nThe EPA insists it has imposed strict conditions on the power generator, so there will be no additional detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nEPA development assessments manager Tim Faragher said the decision allowed higher-efficiency turbine blades to be fitted to the power-generating units.\n\nHe said the new turbines would improve power generation capacity 8.6 per cent but decrease the intensity of emissions by 5 per cent.\n\n\"The upgrade will make Loy Yang B the least greenhouse-intensive brown coal-fired power generator in Victoria,\" Mr Faragher said.\n\nHe said at least 114 megawatts of coal-fired electricity generation capacity had to be retired before the upgrade could proceed. However, the closure of Hazelwood would satisfy that reduction.\n\nHazelwood produced about 13 per cent of Victoria's emissions and up to a quarter of its electricity.\n\nEnvironment Victoria chief executive Mark Wakeham said the EPA's decision was \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nThe plant's expansion would make it harder for the state government to reach its target of zero emissions by 2050, he said.\n\n\"If Victoria is to keep its commitments to contribute to global efforts to stay below two degrees of warming, brown coal-power stations need to be phased out urgently,\" Mr Wakeham said.\n\nThe EPA confirmed that burning the additional coal would result in a 4 per cent increase in carbon emissions at Loy Yang B.\n\nBut Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the decision meant lower emissions for Victoria.\n\nLatrobe Valley community group Voices of the Valley has also raised concerns about the expansion. The group's president, Wendy Farmer, said the power station's pollution allowance was too high.\n\nEngie welcomed the move, saying the upgrade would improve the station's efficiency and \"increase operating flexibility\".\n\nThe upgrade will occur in 2019 and 2020 during \"planned major outages\". In a community update issued before the approval, Engie described Loy Yang B as one of the most efficient power stations in the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\"The new turbine design for the retrofit of the existing turbines will result in further improvement,\" it said.\n\nLoy Yang B employs about 150 full-time staff. It is supplied with coal by a neighbouring mine.\n\nFriends of the Earth criticised the expansion, saying it would prolong coal generation when urgent action was required to tackle climate change.\n\n\"It's time to bring the EPA into the 21st century so it can play a key role in tackling climate change,\" the group said.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Engie hopes to sell Loy Yang B.

They want us to pay the extra money when there is not the extra lanes,\" he said.\n\nTransurban and the Andrews government have said freight operators will benefit from the widened tollway, because it will provide quicker and more reliable travel times.\n\nThey have also forecast a reduction in truck traffic on suburban streets due to a 30 per cent increase in capacity.\n\nOnce complete, the project will deliver \"a reduction in commercial vehicles using local roads, as 3000 more commercial vehicles will be able to access the freeway,\" a briefing document for freight operators says.\n\nIt also argued the increase was fair given the damage heavy vehicles do to road surfaces.\n\n\"Trucks cause a significantly greater amount of wear and tear on the freeway network and this is reflected in the truck tolling fee structure,\" the document said.\n\nAbout 26,000 commercial vehicles use CityLink each day. Extra lanes are being added to the Bolte Bridge as part of the CityLink/Tulla widening project. Photo: Justin McManus. Martin Wurt is spokesman for the Maribyrnong Truck Action Group, which has lobbied to reduce truck traffic in Melbourne's inner west.\n\nHe said higher tolls would inevitably cause an increase in suburban truck traffic without truck bans on residential streets.\n\n\"Without truck bans, operators are going to avoid tolls where they can, particularly the smaller owner-operators who don't receive a lot of money for doing the empty container runs,\" Mr Wurt said.\n\nA spokesman for Luke Donnellan, Victoria's roads minister, said the industry had been given two years' warning about the toll increase.\n\n\"Trucking rates are being brought into line with other states and territories \u2013 VicRoads and Transurban have been working with the freight industry over the last two years to ensure they had time to adjust.\" The story first appeared on The Age.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adam Carey"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Big rise in CityLink truck tolls tipped to push heavy vehicles onto local roads","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3689","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wodonga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Albury Border Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169682320","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"76"},"name":"Albury Border Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bordermail.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195009336","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/cd477594-a07c-49d4-897b-4dde7e9af0aa.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

I understand that much of it has to do with the build up to the Big Game and the chance for tons of media personnel to dig through every nook and cranny of a team and its players to try and get \u201cthe story.\u201d \n \nThe Super Bowl has become a big international event. \n \nI can still remember the fiasco with The Beast, Marshawn Lynch, and his repeated answer a couple of years ago \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just here so I won\u2019t get fined.\u201d \n \nThe fact that media people kept asking him anything leaves me to wonder about them as media people. \n \nThen when he \u201cbreaks his silence\u201d after his Seahawks got beat by basically ripping his coach for not giving him the ball on the goal line at the end, saying the only reason he didn\u2019t was they didn\u2019t want him to be the MVP, that got me thinking maybe that is the reason he doesn\u2019t like to talk to the media. \n \nHe has nothing of value to really say. \n \nI understand it can get boring and tiring to be constantly asked questions about this or that but, hey, you are well paid to be playing this game and you ARE playing in this game. \n \nBe thankful anyone cares! \n \nMany of us wish we could have had the opportunity to play at such a high level but we weren\u2019t born 6-7, or didn\u2019t have the quickest first step or could never run a 4-3 4","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The agony of life minus football, pt. 1","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Allen","zipCode":"45833","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Delphos","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Delphos Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169754727","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Delphos Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.delphosherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195011923","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate.

Yes, the WhatsApp message reads, \u201cManu Punjabi leaves Bigg Boss 10 for (Rs) 10 lakhs\u201d. Is it true? We expected the Bigg Boss 10 Grand Finale episode on Sunday, January 29, 2017, to be a great battle, with the four Bigg Boss 10 finalists Bani J, Lopamudra Raut, Manveer Gurjar and Manu Punjabi (aka Manoj Punjabi). So, this rumour of Manu Punjabi having quit Bigg Boss 10 ahead of the grand finale by settling for a compensation money of a meagre Rs 10 lakh comes as a shock viewers! \n \nWhile it is no secret that the ladies Bani J and Lopamudra Raut don\u2019t see eye to eye on Bigg Boss 10 , being completely opposite personalities, Manu Punjabi and Manveer Gurjar have always been friends and hung out together on the show. So, has Manu Punjabi sacrificed his chance to win Bigg Boss 10 for his pal? Or is it just that Manu feels that although he started out being popular on Bigg Boss 10 , it is Manveer Gurjar who now has an edge and a chance to win more votes than the other contestants? \n  \nThe moment has finally arrived where the winner of this season so be unveiled!

والفرق شاسع والصلة غير منعقدة، ولكن رغبة إثراء الخطاب الحمساوي بالمعطيات الدينية التاريخية أسهل من التصدي للفشل أو معالجة الخلل أو المراجعة للذات والاعتراف بالخطأ، فأنتم-أيها المصلين ويا اهل غزة- مثل الرسول يقول عنكم \"أهل الجاهلية\" أنكم مجانين وسحرة ولا واقعيين لذلك تُحاصرون؟!

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n \nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n \n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n \nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n \nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n \nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n \n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n \nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. \n \n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n \nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n \n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n \nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n \nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n \nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area.  \n \nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury.  \n \nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n \nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand.  \n \nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand.  \n \nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n \nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals.  \n \n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n \nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n \n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that. And there are no controls,\" Cahill said. \n \nHe said in some cases in Auckland, returning offenders had checked out of supported living arrangements or motels before police arrived for their checkup.  \n \n\"They're not breaking the law per se when they do that, because a lot of them aren't under any restrictions. They're just into the wind.\" \n \n  \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"EMILY SPINK"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Dozens of Australian deportees are being sent to NZ on a weekly basis","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southland Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697795","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Southland Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195015396","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There is no evidence to suggest that cigarette smoking would cause diseases depicted in the pictures or that larger GHW will lead to reduction in consumption.\u201d \tOn May 4, 2016 Supreme Court had asked Karnataka High Court to hear and dispose of legal challenge to GHW pending in several HCs while also ordering that any stay order given by any HC will not be given effect to till the cases are finally disposed of. \n \n\u201cHearings on the matter are currently underway,\u201d ITC said, adding that it was currently manufacturing cigarettes \u201cwith 85 per cent warning in compliance with the interim requirements pending final decision by Karnataka High Court on the matter\u201d. \n \nITC said the global average size for GHW is only about 30 per cent of the principal display area. \n \n\u201cMoreover, the top three cigarette consuming countries \u2014 USA, China and Japan which together account for 51 per cent of global cigarette consumption have only text based warning and not adopted pictorial/graphic health warnings,\u201d it added. \n \nCiting an independent study, ITC said: \u201cIndia is now the 4th largest market for illegal cigarettes in the world. In fact, illegal trade comprising smuggled foreign and domestically manufactured tax-evaded cigarettes is estimated to constitute one-fifth of the overall cigarette industry in India and is estimated to cost the exchequer a revenue loss of more than Rs 9,000 crore per annum.\u201d MORE \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Tobacco industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"ITC hits out at large graphic warning rule on cigarette packs","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195015560","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_05.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2580","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Goulburn","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Goulburn Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270460212","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Goulburn Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goulburnpost.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195021345","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Frampton won the first bout by a similar majority-decision scoreline but couldn't avoid the first loss of his career in this second go-around.  \n \nSanta Cruz made the necessary adjustments to win this time around, making great use of his jab and a  seven-inch  reach advantage to both hurt Frampton and prevent him from controlling the pace of the bout.  \n \nFrampton 's excellent counterpunching was apparent throughout, and the exciting pugilism on display will likely have fight fans everywhere hoping for a rubber match between these two.  \n \nFrampton himself wants another bout, per the  Los Angeles Times ' Lance Pugmire : \n  Lance Pugmire @latimespugmire  \nFrampton reddened under the right eye. He says the brawler lost to the boxer and \"we have to do it again.\" \n 1/29/2017, 5:01:17 AM   \nSanta Cruz got off to a better start in this fight than in the first edition, using his length to keep the smaller Frampton at bay and landing some stinging jabs.  \n \nA volume puncher by trade, Santa Cruz showed a level of restraint early on, per NYFights .com's Michael Woods: \n  Michael Woods @Woodsy1069  \nLeo throwing smarter, not harder. Throwing less, not falling in to counters \n 1/29/2017, 4:16:01 AM   \nWhen the action went to the ropes, limiting Santa Cruz's reach advantage, Frampton was able to get in some precise counterpunches to the head and body, particularly with the left hook.  \n\nThe third and fourth rounds featured a few vicious, crowd-pleasing exchanges between the two fighters, as Frampton took the fight inside and forced Santa Cruz to trade punches. Here's a look at the fourth-round action, via Showtime Boxing:    \n  SHOWTIME Boxing @ShowtimeBoxing  \nPunches in bunches between @RealCFrampton & @leosantacruz2. #FramptonSantaCruz2 #Boxing https://t.co/7Cp6DA6yDm \n 1/29/2017, 4:24:07 AM   \nFrampton 's head movement throughout much of the bout was excellent, but he dropped his gloves at the end of the fifth and absorbed several hard shots to the jaw. However, the Belfast fighter didn't look any worse for wear, and the action continued at a frenetic pace.  \n\nBoxing journalist Andreas Hale distilled the fight down to the key weapons for each boxer:  \n  Andreas Hale @AndreasHale  \nFrampton left hook to the head vs. Santa Cruz\u2019 left hook to the body. \n 1/29/2017, 4:32:48 AM   \nWhile the offense in the bout was in ample supply, Frampton did entertain the crowd with some sublime movement that had Santa Cruz punching air at the end of the seventh. \n \nFrampton fought with greater urgency in the later rounds, though Santa Cruz still kept up his usual taxing work rate. Santa Cruz's jab kept Frampton out of the easy rhythm he slid into on the first fight, and his counterpunches were cleaner as well.  \n\nThere was still little between these two all the way to the final bell, as an aggressive Frampton pushed Santa Cruz to the ropes on multiple occasions and pounded away with his furious flurries. \n \nThe pace hardly subsided despite fatigue becoming a factor, and Santa Cruz was able to land well enough in the final rounds to keep Frampton from swinging the bout at the end.  \n \nShowtime Boxing provided some late-round highlights: \n  SHOWTIME Boxing @ShowtimeBoxing  \n.@RealCFrampton & @leosantacruz2 trade shots as we enter round 11 #FramptonSantaCruz2 #Boxing https://t.co/22pe43Vynp \n 1/29/2017, 4:48:58 AM   \nMake no mistake, a third fight between these two should be on every boxing fan's wish list. Both are aggressive fighters who provide plenty of action and are still under 30 years old. The Mexican Santa Cruz and the Belfast native Frampton provide global appeal. The two showed plenty of mutual admiration during the bout, tapping gloves between several rounds and quickly embracing as soon as the final bell sounded.  \n \nIf Santa Cruz and Frampton can get a third fight done, it will likely be another entertaining slugfest and a victory for the sport and its fans.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nate LoopFeatured Columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: boxing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Carl Frampton vs. Leo Santa Cruz 2: Winner, Scorecard and Reaction","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bleacher Report US","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"433279790","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24889"},"name":"Bleacher Report US","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Boxing"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://bleacherreport.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://twitter.com/Nate_Loop","https://twitter.com/ESPNBoxing/status/825568867095298048","http://boxrec.com/boxer/374624","http://boxrec.com/boxer/499601","https://twitter.com/latimespugmire/status/825569482659598336","https://twitter.com/Woodsy1069/status/825558091475329024","https://twitter.com/ShowtimeBoxing/status/825560130750074880","https://twitter.com/AndreasHale/status/825562312417239040","https://twitter.com/ShowtimeBoxing/status/825566380543971328","https://t.co/7Cp6DA6yDm","https://t.co/22pe43Vynp"],"sequenceId":"695195025756","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:34:38Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n\nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n\n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n\n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew BEATTY"},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Standerton Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534543046","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Standerton Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://standertonadvertiser.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195026800","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It could be four divisions for football, if the six teams from the Santa Cruz Coast Athletic League that joined the MTAL after the SCCAL disbanded in the sport choose to remain in the league. \n \nChange always scares people, particularly in a league that has been around for more than 50 years. Yet, the majority of the MTAL is pushing this plan. \n \nThe hope is to create more of a competitive balance for the two leagues. Clearly, we don\u2019t have that right now in the MTAL, as the same teams continue to dominate certain sports. \n \nNeed an example. \n \nCarmel has won eight of the last nine MTAL football titles. Pacific Grove is headed towards a fourth straight boys basketball title. Santa Catalina has won four consecutive track titles. King City has four straight boys track titles. I can go on. \n \nThis is not a bad thing. Yes, there needs to be change in some capacity in both leagues. At times equity among the MBL\u2019s Gabilan and Pacific Division has worked. On more occasions, however, it has hurt a program with its building process. \n \nMoving reigning Pacific Division-champion Alisal into the Gabilan Division for girls basketball has left them winless this winter. That\u2019s not what this is intended to do. \n \nWere the Trojans prepared to make the leap? Was this thought out enough? Because there is a significant difference between the two divisions in the MBL for all sports. \n \nWinning a league title should not automatically constitute a move up. And it doesn\u2019t. Case in point is the Trojans boys basketball program, which went undefeated in the MBL-P last year and did not move up. \n \nThat likely won\u2019t be the case next year as Alisal is currently undefeated in the MBL-P, with five sophomores making an impact. Two consecutive titles warrants a move up, particularly when the cast is coming back \u2014 five of them for the next two years. \n \nThe biggest argument in the MTAL\u2019s merger with the MBL comes from football coaches. Concerns about safety are valid. \n \n \nNo program in the MTAL has a freshmen football program. Every team in the MBL-G does and most programs more than double the size of any MTAL roster. Don\u2019t think that\u2019s not a significant advantage in a physical sport. \n \nYet, lets keep this in prospective: For an MTAL team to get bumped into the MBL-G, it would first have to be moved into the MBL-P and win that league. \n \nWith this merger not slated until 2018, that\u2019s at least two more years before that possibility exists. Personally, I don\u2019t think any MTAL football program has any business in the MBL-G. \n \nBut there is no guarantee that will ever happen. My hunch would be that if an MTAL team won a MBL-P football title, it would have to duplicate the feat to warrant consideration. \n \nMerging the MTAL with the MBL makes sense with most sports. The real issue \u2014 which has little to do with the purposed MTAL merger \u2014 is finding balance among teams that are pushed into the MBL\u2019s Gabilan Division from the Pacific Division. \n \nThe first five teams in the MBL-G for most sports are usually stacked. It\u2019s the bottom two that often take a beating. History backs that. \n \nHence, we see them often dropped to the MBL-P for two sacrificial lambs. A year or two later, the new arrivals often end up back in the MBL-P. \n \nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fear of jumping to a new league that cripples a program before the year begins. Or just bad decisions. I mean there is a reason the Gabilan is \u2018A\u2019 division and the Pacific and MTAL are \u2018B\u2019 divisions. \n \nIs there a solution? Well, you can\u2019t have a five-team division. Someone has to go up. So are the right teams going up? \n \nAlisal and Christopher are winless in the MBL-G in girls basketball this winter. One may drop, but not both. But there\u2019s not a team in the MBL-P today that could contend in the Gabilan. \n \nChristopher had no business in the MBL-G for football this past fall. Yet, despite an 0-6 mark in 2015, it was left in the league and promptly went winless again. \n \nIts lone win all year came against Gilroy, which reached the CCS Division IV finals coming out of the MBL-P. \n \nThat\u2019s a true indication of how different those divisions are in competitive balance \u2014 for most sports. \n \nChristopher will be competitive next year in the MBL-P for football. Seaside\u2019s promotion will be scrutinized, particularly since it lost its two best offensive weapons and Pacific Division Defensive Player of the Year. \n \nNo one is trying to penalize a program for success. Teams from the MTAL that ultimately get bumped to the MBL-P will be fine. The MBL-G is another story. But that\u2019s a ways down the road, if ever. The real issue isn\u2019t the MTAL merging. It\u2019s finding the right two teams that can jump into the MBL-G and at least be competitive. The idea is to build programs back up, not shatter their confidence. \n \nContact John Devine at 831-726-4337.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Devine jdevine@montereyherald.com @JohnJDevine on Twitter"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Just a Thought: MTAL closing in on merger with MBL","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Santa Cruz","zipCode":"95060","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Cruz","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Santa Cruz Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169679227","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"531"},"name":"Santa Cruz Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.santacruzsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195028570","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.santacruzsentinel.com/storyimage/NE/20170128/SPORTS/170129700/AR/0/AR-170129700.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Amadi stands a better chance of transforming Vihiga from the current state to what the residents need. \n\nKakamega is among the best performing counties and hence the reason the locals yearn for the same to be replicated in Vihiga, and that probably can be through their own son Eng. Amadi. \n\nMeanwhile, before thinking of unseating Governor Akaranga, Eng. Amadi has to fight it out with Hon. Yusuf Chanzu, who is an experienced hand in politics, for the ANC Ticket. \n\n So far, the battle lines between the two camps have been drawn with each trying to show the reason as to why he stands out a better chance to not only unseat the incumbent but also transform Vihiga.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":": Musalia Mudavadi's lieutenant in  Vihiga County is seeking to transform the county","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"KE","country":"Kenya"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"East African Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660745","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"916"},"name":"East African Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Regional","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke","publisher":"The Standard Group Ltd."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195029156","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\u201d asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n\n\u201cAre they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\u201d \n\nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power. \n\nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country. \n\nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire. \n\nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony\u2019s independence 40 years ago \n\n\u2013 \u2018Won\u2019t give up on truce\u2019 \u2013 \n\nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too. \n\n\u201cThe armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\u201d he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched. \n\n\u201cEither Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\u201d he said. \n\nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n\nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe. \n\nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations. \n\nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country. \n\n\u201cI must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\u201d said Dhlakama. \n\nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement. \n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up on the truce. But every day someone calls me up to ask me to extend it beyond March 4. And I always tell them that it will depend on the progress of the negotiations.\u201d \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adrien BARBIER"},"topics":[{"name":"Mozambique news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mozambique rebel leader accuses soldiers of violating ceasefire","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Standerton Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534543046","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Standerton Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://standertonadvertiser.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195029860","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

However, when you move past this obvious fact of political topography, disputes arise. \n \nFor example, what is the cause of the partisan divide? Nationally, Republicans blame Democrats for a radicalization that began in the 1960s. Democrats blame Republicans for a radicalization that began in the 1980s. \n \nBecause most journalists, professors, and other \u201cexperts\u201d are of the Left or deferential to it, the conventional wisdom tends to reflect the Democratic narrative. It offers a version of political history in which Republicans tend to be acceptable and sensible to the extent they become safely retired or deceased. \n \nIn response, the conservative counterculture has created its own narratives \u2014 some serving as a necessary corrective, others fanciful and debilitating. \n \nHere is another question: Has the polarization been a net negative or a net plus? \n \nYou may think the question answers itself. But speaking as a conservative, I would observe that complaints about a lack of bipartisanship are far more common when progressives are out of power. Recent history appears to suggest that Republicans do better when there is more brand differentiation, while Democrats do better when the party lines are fuzzier. If you want to chase suspicious conservatives away from your dialogue, cite the enactment of policies they favor as proof that we have too much partisanship. \n \nAll that having been said, I do indeed believe in bridging the partisan divide. For one thing, our discourse has become coarse, often even revolting. There is a difference between arguing and bickering, between a frank and productive exchange of alternative views and the political equivalent of the World Wrestling Federation. \n \nFor another thing, legislating needs to be about more than 51 percent of the elected officials getting 100 percent of their way. You can dislike a bill and still have something constructive to say about it, something its proponents might benefit from hearing and acting on. Also, and this point was made many times by conservatives in 2009 and 2010, it is unwise to enact major changes in public policy such as the Affordable Care Act without any buy-in at all from some members of the other party. All successful political leaders negotiate the details of legislation in search of larger margins of support. \n \nWhen it comes to building more bridges, I have two engineering suggestions. First, understand your task. You are not trying to put hooks on each bank of the river and then yank them together. That is impossible. You are not Paul Bunyan. You are building a bridge across a divide that will continue to exist, because we have different opinions and an electoral system that inevitably pushes opinionated people into roughly two competing coalitions. \n \nSecond, while you have every right to believe that the right bank of the river is better than the left bank, or vice versa, try not to be so obnoxious about it. Understand that others probably see things differently from you not because they are evil or stupid, but because they possess a different set of facts, experiences, assumptions and values. \n \nThere is a natural temptation to define bipartisanship as \u201cwhen those ignorant fools in the other party finally do the right thing.\u201d Resist that temptation. In a political climate more civil than the one we have now, in which Democrats and Republicans have more productive discussions about their differences, you will still be routinely disappointed with outcomes. Government will do things you don\u2019t agree with, or even find abhorrent. If you refuse to live in that world, then I respectfully observe you seek not bipartisan realism but partisan fantasy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"John Hood: Let\u2019s try to be realistic about bipartisanship","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Edgecombe","zipCode":"27802","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Rocky Mount","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rocky Mount Telegram","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169756322","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"34"},"name":"Rocky Mount Telegram","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rockymounttelegram.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195038348","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The church urges all people and governments to cooperate fully in seeking the best solutions to meet human needs and relieve suffering.\" \n \nOn Friday afternoon, Trump signed an executive order that suspended the U.S. refugee resettlement program for four months. It also cut the number of refugees the United States will accept this year to 50,000, down from the 110,000 set by President Barack Obama. \n \nA federal judge blocked part of the order on Saturday. \n \nThe order barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and blocked entry to anyone from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days. The State Department said those countries are seven predominantly Muslim nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nThat led religious faiths throughout the United States to voice concerns about religious freedom. \n \nThis is the second time the LDS Church has responded to Trump's calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States. \n \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a strong statement in December 2015 soon after Trump on the campaign trail called for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. \n \nLike Saturday's statement, the December 2015 statement did not name Trump or refer specifically to the controversy, but it said that while the faith is neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns, \"it is not neutral in relation to religious freedom.\" \n \nIt drew on two statements by church founder Joseph Smith to reaffirm its longstanding position of support for religious pluralism. \n  \nIn 1841, Smith was the mayor of the largely Mormon city of Nauvoo, Illinois, when it passed a religious freedom ordinance that protected the rights of all faiths. In 1843, Smith said he was willing to die to defend the religious freedom rights of people of any denomination. \n \nIn September, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles called for governments to do more to help refugees. \n \n\"Governments today are not responding to the refugee problem urgently enough, nor on a large enough scale,\" he said. \n Comment on this story  \nHe said the plight of the world's 60 million refugees should generate outrage. \n \n\"The world needs to be more outraged than it is,\" he said, \"when we read of the persecution, the violence, the sexual violence, the murder, the rape, the destruction of families and any social structure that these people have had \u2014 almost entire cultures being destroyed.\" \n \nFinally, Elder Holland made a clear reference to the faith's \" I Was a Stranger \" program, launched last spring . The program called on Mormons, especially the women of the faith's global Relief Society, to help individual refugees resettling in their communities. \n \n\"We need to encourage local citizens to welcome (refugees) into their everyday lives,\" he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tad Walch"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"LDS Church issues statement after Trump orders ban on refugees","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Salt Lake","zipCode":"84110","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salt Lake City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Deseret Morning News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663405","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4002"},"name":"Deseret Morning News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deseretnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/the-church-expresses-concern-for-those-fleeing-violence-war-and-religious-persecution","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?action=click&contentCollection=Sports&module=Trending&version=Full%C2%AEion=Marginalia&pgtype=article&_r=0","https://www.lds.org/refugees?cid=HP_SA_26-3-2016_dPFD_fCNWS_xLIDyL2-1_&lang=eng","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?action=click&#38;contentCollection=Sports&#38;module=Trending&#38;version=Full%C2%AEion=Marginalia&#38;pgtype=article&#38;_r","https://www.lds.org/refugees?cid=HP_SA_26-3-2016_dPFD_fCNWS_xLIDyL2-1_&#38;lang=eng"],"sequenceId":"695195049551","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:07:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/headline/queue2/865672124/865672124.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

His 2.20 goals-against average during a 16-season career with the Chicago Blackhawks, Buffalo Sabres, Detroit Red Wings and Ottawa Senators is tops among retired modern goaltenders (from the Original Six era onward). \n \nHis save percentage of .922 is also the best among retired goaltenders. For six consecutive seasons (1993-99), he led the NHL in that category, and for five of them his save percentage was an astounding .930 or better. And it wasn't because Hasek had easy duty: In two of those seasons -- 1995-96 and 1997-98 -- he faced more shots per 60 minutes than any other goalie. \n \nHe was awarded the Vezina Trophy as the League's top goaltender six times in eight seasons and won the Hart Trophy in 1997 and 1998, the only goalie to be named the NHL's most valuable player more than once. He was among the top three in Hart voting three other times. \n \nGames: 735 | Wins: 389 | Losses: 223 | Ties: 82 | OT Losses: 13 | GAA: 2.20 \n \nAnd he accomplished most of this for a decent but not overpowering Buffalo Sabres team, forcing him to be the best player on the ice seemingly every time he stood -- or flopped -- in the crease. \n \nMitch Korn, Hasek's goalie coach for six years with the Sabres, put it best when he told Bill Hoppe of the Olean Times Herald in 2014, \"We will argue until the cows come home that the Big Three, if you will -- Patrick Roy, Martin Brodeur and Hasek -- in the modern era will go down as the three greatest. But for me, nobody made more of a difference every night [than Hasek], because he didn't play with maybe as good a team as either of those other two, and he did it every night, not just every six games, not just occasionally. This guy did it every night for a good long period of time. He was that dominant on a team that really needed him to be dominant.\" \n \nAnd that's how Hasek became known as \"The Dominator.\" \n \nHow he made saves struck many as mysterious, especially early in his NHL career. \n \n\"He was so awkward,\" Brodeur told Time magazine in 1999. \"I had never seen that from another goalie before. I couldn't believe it at first. I thought, 'That's lucky. He's a lucky goalie.'\" \n \nWhile he did drop down on many shots, Hasek was hardly the first great goaltender to be classified as a flopper. Hall of Famers Gump Worsley and Gerry Cheevers also hurled their bodies at enemy shots. As they did, Hasek recognized most shots came in low and that the more of the ice you covered, the better your chances of stopping them. But Hasek's arsenal also included unique maneuvers like dropping his goal stick to grab a loose puck with his blocker hand, aggressively charging out great distances to foil a shooter on a breakaway, and the \"barrel roll\" -- rolling on his back and cartwheeling his legs up in the air to stop some shots. \n \nSharp-eyed goalie analysts recognized that no matter how the ultra-flexible Hasek contorted his Gumby-like body, he always remained square to the shooter, who he forced into less advantageous angles. His in-game genius included exceptional anticipation and great concentration in his ability to read plays and track shooters' movements, and that Hasek's movements were not as random as they seemed, but calculated. As Kevin Woodley wrote in InGoal magazine, \"Hasek worked hard to perfect his methods. They included never giving up on a save and always having one last limb (or even his head) left to throw out at a shooter.\" \n \nHasek honed his distinctive style through a fierce, determined work ethic. He didn't limit his characteristic intensity to games. \"Dom was the only guy I played with who tried to stop every puck in practice,\" fellow Red Wings goalie Chris Osgood said. \"Every day he'd go into practice and try to stop every puck, no excuses.\" Former Red Wings teammate Henrik Zetterberg said Hasek \"gave it all, all the time. He'd get really angry if you scored on him in practices.\" \n \nThe first major impression Hasek made on the NHL came in the 1992 Stanley Cup Final against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Having played sparingly during two seasons with the Blackhawks, he was inserted into Game 4 of Pittsburgh's sweep and startled the hockey world by making save after acrobatic save against the eventual champions, including stopping a Mario Lemieux breakaway, which few goalies ever did. It was Hasek's \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" moment as fans throughout North America asked, \"Who is this guy?\" \n \nFew knew Hasek, then 27, had dominated hockey in his native Czechoslovakia, not merely being selected as the Extraliga's Goaltender of the Year from 1986 through 1990, but also named the league's top player three times. \n \nHe was born Jan. 29, 1965 in the industrial city of Pardubice, a hockey hotbed, and 6-year-old Dominik played his first hockey as a goalie for a 9-year-old team there. The Cold War kept him from seeing NHL goaltenders, and that lack of exposure was one explanation for his individualistic style. Chicago selected him in the 10th round (No. 199) of the NHL Draft in 1983, when getting young Eastern Europeans into the NHL was plainly impossible. By 1990, the combination of Hasek's 10 years of great domestic and international success plus a thawing of East-West relations made his journey across the Atlantic a reality. \n \nBut moving up the Blackhawks depth chart was difficult because of the emergence of Ed Belfour. However, the Sabres had scouted him and, needing a goaltending upgrade, they traded for Hasek two months after his Stanley Cup debut. The Sabres' depth chart was also crowded, but that gave Korn time to work with Hasek. \"He was so smart, he knew exactly what was going to happen next, but he was too early,\" Korn said. \"So he showed his hand like a bad poker player.\" \n \nThe two worked on a more patient approach and improved his use of the catching glove. When No. 1 goalie Grant Fuhr was injured early in the 1993-94 season, Hasek was ready. \n \nIn his first month as a starter, he registered five shutouts. He played 58 games and had a 1.95 average, the first goalie to finish below 2.00 since Bernie Parent was at 1.89 in 1973-74. Though little was expected from the Sabres after top scorer Pat LaFontaine had season-ending knee surgery in early December, Hasek led the Sabres into the postseason against the New Jersey Devils, where Hasek and the rookie Brodeur engaged in a terrific matchup, highlighted by a marathon Game 6 that extended into a fourth overtime before the Sabres prevailed 1-0. After six hours and 70 saves, Hasek said he felt he could have played two more periods. The Devils won Game 7, but in June, the 29-year-old Hasek won his first Vezina Trophy, was runner-up for the Hart Trophy and was on his way to superstardom. \n \nMore Vezina trophies and All-Star Team honors followed. Hasek starred at the 1998 Nagano Olympics for the gold medal-winning Czech Republic team and was named the tournament's top goalie. He then had a strong second half for Buffalo, helping the Sabres reach the Eastern Conference Final, and won his second Hart Trophy. \n \nIn 1999 he and the Sabres made it to the Cup Final against the Stars, who had Hasek's former teammate Belfour in goal. The series culminated in a three-overtime thriller in Game 6. Dallas won it 2-1 with one of the most controversial goals in Stanley Cup Playoff history. Hasek had made 50 saves, but couldn't make his 51st as Brett Hull banged in the puck around Hasek's net with his skate in the goal crease. Rules prohibited an attacking player from entering the crease before the puck, but the officials ruled the Stars had maintained possession of the puck prior to the shot and the goal was allowed to stand despite protests from Buffalo. \n \nThat was as close as the Sabres would come to the Cup during Hasek's time there. Despite another Vezina Trophy for Hasek in 2000-01, Buffalo's need to shed salary plus Hasek's desire to play for a contender led to a trade with Detroit in 2001. \n \nThe 36-year-old Hasek thus began anew with a deep, veteran team that included Hull. The two became friends but didn't speak about the 1999 Cup-winning goal throughout the 2001-02 season. Hasek played well for the Red Wings, with a League-best and career-high 41 wins. But the stats that mattered most were the 16 playoff wins, and those victories, including the final four against the Carolina Hurricanes, put his name on the Stanley Cup. After the triumph, Hasek and Hull finally shared a laugh about the '99 Final. \"It was after we won the Cup and we were drinking champagne and having great time,\" Hasek said. \"Of course, I told him it was no goal and he told me it was a goal.\" \n \nFrom then on, Hasek was a mercurial presence in the NHL. He retired for a season, then came back to the Red Wings for 2003-04 but played only 14 games before a groin injury ended his season. He signed with the Senators and played well in the first half of 2005-06 but was injured playing for the Czech Republic during the 2006 Torino Olympics and never dressed for Ottawa again. He rejoined the Red Wings for 2006-07, playing often and well for a 42-year-old and helping Detroit reach the Western Conference Final. \n \nIn 2007-08, his final NHL season, Hasek split the job with Osgood. They shared the Jennings Trophy (for allowing the fewest goals in the NHL) and Hasek started the playoffs against the Nashville Predators. But the 43-year-old wasn't sharp and Osgood replaced him after Game 4. Detroit won the Cup, defeating Pittsburgh, and Hasek retired from the NHL shortly afterward -- although, amazingly, he continued to play in Europe until he was 46 (he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2014). \n \nBut Hasek's value to his teams was not forgotten. \n \n\"You take it for granted and don't realize how important he was, until you get a goalie in there who's not Dominik Hasek,\" said Michael Peca, the Sabres captain during some of Hasek's best seasons. \"All of a sudden you find yourself making the safe plays all the time, which doesn't always lend to creating offensive opportunities. He made everyone in front of him better, just by allowing us to play without fear of making mistakes. We were fortunate to have him there for that very reason.\" \n \nFor more, see all 100 Greatest Players","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NHL - Pittsburgh Penguins news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NHL - Detroit Red Wings news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NHL - Buffalo Sabres news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NHL - Chicago Blackhawks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NHL - Ottawa Senators news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dominik Hasek: 100 Greatest NHL Players 'The Dominator' won Vezina Trophy six times, only goalie to capture Hart Trophy twice","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"NHL.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169680713","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2367"},"name":"NHL.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer","IceHockey"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nhl.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195054051","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Coming into this matchup, the Aztecs were plagued by more injuries as forward Zylan Cheatham sat out and was in a walking boot during shootaround. \n \nIn the first half, the two teams looked evenly matched as they traded baskets in the opening minutes of the game. The momentum shifted when highly touted Malik Pope took the ball full court for a slam dunk that forced the Rams to call a timeout and put the Aztecs crowd on their feet with 12:01. \n \nDespite Cheatham\u2019s absence, the Aztecs needed someone else to step up. Washington State transfer Valentine Izundu saw more minutes and delivered an emphatic reverse dunk and a few major blocks that excited the crowd. Dakarai Allen led the Aztecs with 9 points and the Aztecs led 33-23 heading into halftime. \n \nIn the second half, the Aztecs continued to keep a comfortable lead around 10 to 12 points in the first five minutes. However, the Rams were persistent and never let the game get out of hand. Specifically, they would go on a 9-3 run that closed the gap at 53-51 with 10:34 remaining. \n \nRams\u2019 forward Emmanuel Omogbo\u2019s three-point shot tied the game at 64, which was the first tie since 5:13 in the first half. In addition, senior guard Gian Clavell was dominant throughout the game and down the stretch for the Rams. He went on to score the Rams final 12 points in the final 3:32, which included the game-winning layup with 3.8 seconds. A final heave at the buzzer by Jeremy Hemsley hit the back of the rim and left the Aztecs stunned after conceiving a 13-point halftime lead. \n \nFor the Aztecs, Pope had a solid game with 19 points and 7 rebounds, and Hemsley added 17 points and 3 assists. Meanwhile, Rams\u2019 forward Omogbo had a career best 24 points and 9 rebounds. \n \nPlayer of the game: \n \nIt is an easy decision to award this to Rams\u2019 Gian Clavell , who finished with a career-high 37 points, along with 8 rebounds and two blocks. Whenever the Rams needed a basket, Clavell would deliver. From sinking several fade away jump shots and three pointers, he was clutch when the Rams looked for someone to step up. \n \nUp Next: \n \nSDSU: The Aztecs will look to bounce back after another loss and face Wyoming at home on Tuesday night. \n \nCSU: The Rams will look to win their fourth straight when they face Boise State on Tuesday at home.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: college basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"SDSU vs. Colorado State Recap: Rams outlast and shock Aztecs at home","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yard Barker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"459817831","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yard Barker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.yardbarker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/teams/colorado-st-rams","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/teams/san-diego-st-aztecs","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/253163/zylan-cheatham","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/253164/malik-pope","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/176249/valentine-izundu","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/231633/dakarai-allen","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/252409/gian-clavell","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/264138/jeremy-hemsley","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/258925/gian-clavell"],"sequenceId":"695195055884","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:07:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(Reuters)  \nSania Mirza will have to wait for her seventh Grand Slam trophy as the Indian and her Croatian partner Ivan Dodig lost the Australian Open mixed doubles final 2-6 4-6 to underdogs Abigail Spears and Juan Sebastian Cabal, here today. \n \nThe second-seeded Indo-Croatian pair paid the price for the free-flowing unforced errors from the racquet of Dodig, who struggled with his serve and groundstrokes today. It is second runners-up finish for Sania and Dodig together after losing the final of the 2016 French Open to Leander Paes and Martina Hingis. \n \nSania had won her first ever Grand Slam at the Australian Open only when she won the mixed doubles with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi in 2009 and the last of her three women\u2019s doubles Major trophies also came here last year with Martina Hingis. \n \nYou may also like to watch this video : \n \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAYwKqXm2Fw \n \nAfter losing the first two points, Dodig served a double fault at 30-30 and then sent a forehand long to concede a break in the very first game of the match. Cabal and Spears though were in tremendous touch from the word go. Both were terrific from the back and at the net too. Sania was also broken in the third game. It was Cabal\u2019s brilliant volley pick up which he placed well beyond the two players to earn a break point. \n \nSpears smashed a backhand service return winner to take the break as the second seeds trailed 0-3. The American had an easy hold in the next to make it 4-0. The second seeds finally got on board when Dodig held the fifth game but they had already suffered the damage. Serving to stay in the opening set at 1-5, Sania saved a deciding a point to hold. \n \nSpears was now serving for the set and lost the first two points to be 0-30 and soon Dodig found a forehand winner to earn a break-point but could not convert. Sania hit a backhand wide on the deciding point to concede the first set. \n \nDodig\u2019s serve was again under pressure as he faced a breakpoint and a deciding point in the first game of the second set but managed to save both. Cabal served a double fault at 40-30 to face a deciding point and the second seeds latched on to that to take a 2-0 lead as Spears hit a backhand long. \n \nSania had an easy hold to make it 3-0 as the Indo-Croatian pair was back in the match. However, Sania was broken in the seventh game which allowed the rivals to neutralise the advantage. The Indian committed a double fault to be down by two breakpoints and Spears smashed one overhead volley to convert the first. Spears held without fuss and the two pairs were now locked 4-4. \n \nDodig was never in his elements in today\u2019s match and he served two double faults, the second one coming on a breakpoint, to allow Cabal to serve out the championship. \n \nPlease Wait while comments are loading...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open Mixed Doubles Final: Sania Mirza and Ivan Dodig lose in the final","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Financial Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659519","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"110"},"name":"Financial Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.financialexpress.com","publisher":"The Indian Express Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAYwKqXm2Fw"],"sequenceId":"695195063806","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/01/sania-lreu_S-300x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A major generator of Victoria's coal-fired electricity is set to be expanded, sparking protests from environment groups over the effect on carbon emissions.\n\nThe planned upgrade of the Loy Yang B power station in the Latrobe Valley comes as its majority owner, Engie, prepares to shut down the Hazelwood plant and coal mine in March.\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted \"works approval\" to upgrade turbines at the plant, which will result in the burning of an extra 400,000 tonnes of coal each year.\n\nLoy Yang B provides about 17 per cent of Victoria's energy needs.\n\nThe EPA insists it has imposed strict conditions on the power generator, so there will be no additional detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nEPA development assessments manager Tim Faragher said the decision allowed higher-efficiency turbine blades to be fitted to the power-generating units.\n\nHe said the new turbines would improve power generation capacity 8.6 per cent but decrease the intensity of emissions by 5 per cent.\n\n\"The upgrade will make Loy Yang B the least greenhouse-intensive brown coal-fired power generator in Victoria,\" Mr Faragher said.\n\nHe said at least 114 megawatts of coal-fired electricity generation capacity had to be retired before the upgrade could proceed. However, the closure of Hazelwood would satisfy that reduction.\n\nHazelwood produced about 13 per cent of Victoria's emissions and up to a quarter of its electricity.\n\nEnvironment Victoria chief executive Mark Wakeham said the EPA's decision was \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nThe plant's expansion would make it harder for the state government to reach its target of zero emissions by 2050, he said.\n\n\"If Victoria is to keep its commitments to contribute to global efforts to stay below two degrees of warming, brown coal-power stations need to be phased out urgently,\" Mr Wakeham said.\n\nThe EPA confirmed that burning the additional coal would result in a 4 per cent increase in carbon emissions at Loy Yang B.\n\nBut Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the decision meant lower emissions for Victoria.\n\nLatrobe Valley community group Voices of the Valley has also raised concerns about the expansion. The group's president, Wendy Farmer, said the power station's pollution allowance was too high.\n\nEngie welcomed the move, saying the upgrade would improve the station's efficiency and \"increase operating flexibility\".\n\nThe upgrade will occur in 2019 and 2020 during \"planned major outages\". In a community update issued before the approval, Engie described Loy Yang B as one of the most efficient power stations in the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\"The new turbine design for the retrofit of the existing turbines will result in further improvement,\" it said.\n\nLoy Yang B employs about 150 full-time staff. It is supplied with coal by a neighbouring mine.\n\nFriends of the Earth criticised the expansion, saying it would prolong coal generation when urgent action was required to tackle climate change.\n\n\"It's time to bring the EPA into the 21st century so it can play a key role in tackling climate change,\" the group said.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Engie hopes to sell Loy Yang B.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n \nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n \nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n \nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n \nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n \n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"South Florida news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump official incorrectly justifies travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Miami-Dade","zipCode":"33137","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Miami","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Local10.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"337015681","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"209"},"name":"Local10.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://local10.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195085393","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:08:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2016/04/06/Farook%20and%20Malik%20together_36804152_8896869_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Since time immemorial, this dissimilitude has been a fundamental factor for giving any sports rivalry a sky-high popularity. Contrast is what produces battles, captivates fans and becomes the driving force of a rivalry and on it, a certain sport grows and thrives. \n \nImagine a Bjorn Borg vs John McEnroe rivalry or for that matter, the one between Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi in more modern times. The attack vs defence is the core of their rivalries and so it is for the one that exists between the 17-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer and the 14-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal, fondly known as Fedal. \n \nWould the fabled Fedal rivalry have been able to capture people\u2019s hearts as effectively as it has if the legends had both been masters of the same style of play? The answer is no. \n \nContrast is the driving force \n \nNadal\u2019s indefatigable defence perfectly counters Federer\u2019s swift aggression. The Swiss maestro\u2019s silky, smooth, effortless style is neutralized by The Bull\u2019s brute muscular force and that has been essential to making their face-offs so thrilling and exuberant.  \n \nThey couldn\u2019t be more dissimilar even with their bread-and-butter shots. Federer has been the epitome of artistic magnificence and his lustrous single-handed backhand is very much a painter\u2019s stroke.  \n \nThe tennis, of course, is the masterpiece.  \n \nNadal, on the other hand, slaps you hard with his lefty forehands.They are savage, vicious, hold his rivals by the scruff of the neck and suck the life out of them. \n \nBut it is not just the tennis; the contrast is evident even in their on-court apparel and appearance in the initial days. Federer was always the perfect one \u2013 suave with not a hair out of place, replete with that debonair charm that has always had such a magnetic effect on his fans.  \n \nIn his autobiography, \u2018Open\u2019, Andre Agassi likened him to Hollywood legend Cary Grant \u2013 and that is an incredibly fitting comparison. \n \nEven under pressure, Federer would never show his simmering tension or his anguish and would hardly even express himself on the court. \n \nNadal was the exact opposite, always ready for a street fight \u2013 the one you could call to settle a drunken brawl in a pub. In pirate pants and sleeveless shirt, the Spaniard with his flowing locks was more a boxer than a tennis player who was always fond of punching blow after blow until he could turn his opponent into an emaciated soul. \n \nAnd he was always the one who would emote more. \n \nYou cannot separate a fistpump from the southpaw, nor can you forget his resounding roars of \u2018VAMOS\u2019 reverberating through the stadium whenever he wins a crucial point. \n \nWhile Federer represented the unsullied and purest form closer to God if there ever could be one in tennis, Nadal was always the voice of the commoner, the sufferer, the tortured. The Spanish matador embodied all those who have never had it easy, all those who fumbled and faltered, yet picked up their tattered selves to fight another day and attain glory.  \n \nEven Rafa\u2019s obsessive-compulsive quirks and idiosyncrasies have made him look very real, identifiable, tangible and accessible. After all, aren\u2019t we all creatures of habit and like to keep it going before some of the biggest tests in our lives?  \n \nWhile some fell for the pristine Federer, some others could relate more to the tormented Nadal. There\u2019s no doubt that this variety has been the very essence of their rivalry. \n \nEpic battles \n \nAsk any tennis aficionado to talk about some epic battles or some of the best matches from the sport of tennis and the 2008 Wimbledon final or the 2009 Australian Open final will inevitably crop up. The drama, the fabulous shotmaking , the edge-of-the-seat stuff, the guts and gumption of both the players still remain etched in the minds of Fedal lovers. \n \nThey have not only mesmerized fans on the Grand Slam stage but have even been involved in some of the most enthralling matches even when the stakes have not been so high. \n \nConsider that 2006 Rome Masters final which has left such an indelible impression. Rafa\u2019s awe-inspiring resilience to save two match points and come back from the jaws of defeat can never be forgotten. Neither can Federer\u2019s stubborn defiance even while trailing two sets to love at the 2005 Miami Masters final. \n \nTheir everlasting desire to keep pushing themselves even when their fans have given up and hope has looked bleak has been unmatched. They have continuously inspired each other to elevate their games even higher and that has been so fascinating to watch. \n \nMutual respect and admiration \n \nNadal has had the upper hand in this competition, winning 23 of the 34 matches they have contested so far. In Slams too, it has been the Majorcan who leads 9-2. \n \nFederer\u2019s last Major victory over his distinguished foe came way back in 2007. But that has in no way diminished the tremendous respect and admiration that they have for each other. Their continued appreciation for each other and outstanding sportsmanship have been exemplary unlike any other rivalry that we have seen in the past. \n \nRafa hugging a crestfallen Roger during the 2009 Australian Open final ceremony is ingrained in the minds of every follower of the game. That was one of the most genuine and touching gestures from a champion that anybody has ever seen in any sport. On that day, their already revered rivalry entered rarefied air where only they could belong.  \n \nThey redefined the term \u2018rivalry\u2019 in the sporting world through their humility and grace. That it is possible to be the biggest well-wishers of each other despite both aiming for the same prize is such a massive lesson for not just sport but life in general as well.  \n \nFedal is an emotion \n \nFedal is much very a priceless experience that evokes the deepest of emotions. They transcend tennis, they are larger than life, and their aura is like no other! For tennis fans of the 2000s, it has been a part and parcel of their lives.  \n \nAnd why not? When the sun set on Sampras\u2019 tennis career in the early 2000s and the world was robbed of the chance to marvel at the famed Sampras-Agassi classic matches, men\u2019s tennis was yearning for new heroes. A new force was needed to infuse life into the waning ATP and the revolution happened in 2003. \n \nA fresh crop of young talents emerged of which Federer\u2019s star would shine the brightest. As the world quickly anointed the Swiss as the best they had ever witnessed and fans started leaning towards Federer, there appeared a teenager on the horizon who had the audacity to make dents into the Federer empire. That he was facing one of the history\u2019s best, who was at his peak, did not deter him. \n \nIt only made him stronger, hungrier as he set his sights on the biggest trophies of the sport and, in the process, he grew to be Federer\u2019s greatest nemesis. They would motivate each other to weave magic with their racquets which caught the world\u2019s imagination. \n \nEvery Major would be in their grasp, no surface would be left for them to conquer. \n \nIf Federer would finally get to taste victory in Paris in 2009 and complete the much-coveted Career Slam, Nadal would follow suit the very next year in New York. \n \nHaving two Career Slammers ruling the sport at the same time before Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray began their inexorable rise has been, unquestionably, a matter of privilege for tennis enthusiasts. \n \nIt divided fans and countless debates would ensue. There would be breathless discussions in the social media and numerous articles would be written extolling their rivalry, putting them on an exalted pedestal. \n \nFederer and Nadal transformed tennis beyond any shred of doubt and they brought more fans into the sport than any rivalry ever possibly could. They have taken tennis to heights not imaginable previously and their impact has been phenomenal not just in the realm of tennis but in the entire sporting domain. \n \nSeeing a 35-year-old Federer and a 30-year-old Nadal return from injuries and turn back the clock when they were not even among the front-runners for the 2017 Australian Open title has been nostalgic for tennis fans to say the least.  \n \nWhich is why the past two days have seen a catharsis of emotions from the most devoted worshippers of these two icons. That they defied every prediction to get so near to a Grand Slam trophy once again just like they used to in their halcyon days, is what perhaps makes them even greater and their rivalry timeless. \n \nWhen Federer and Nadal reprise the Fedal magic for the 35th time today on the sport\u2019s grandest stage, it will be more than just a match. For the fans, it will be reliving their childhood and youth all over again when these two gems taught them to romanticize tennis. \n \nWho knows, they might not even get another opportunity to be so fortunate again. And that is why cherishing every moment of today\u2019s final is worth it. \n \nFetching more content...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sudeshna Banerjee"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Why do we love and cherish the Federer vs Nadal rivalry?","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sportskeeda.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"600290580","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"512"},"name":"Sportskeeda.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sportskeeda.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195085553","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:35:57Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Whenever someone from within the organization moves into a titled job, the company may need to provide training to this employee on employment laws so that he or she does not inadvertently discriminate against former peers. \n \nThe employee is no longer \u201cjust one of the guys.\u201d He or she has to see himself or herself as being removed from those under his or her supervision. To do otherwise may lead to accusations of favoritism, which may lead to decreased morale and even litigation. \n \nWhat is favoritism? \n \nFavoritism is the act of preferring an individual or group of employees over another. This can be both a fair and unfair act. \n \nIf it is rooted in a legitimate business concern, it is expected and may be the basis for company decisions such as hiring, promoting, and reviewing employees. \n \nUnfair favoritism, on the other hand, may be based on a supervisor\u2019s relationship with an applicant or employee. This may be in the form of hiring friends or family for positions without regard to qualifications, or giving preferential treatment, such as job assignments, annual reviews, and the like, to a subordinate that is also a friend. \n \nDysfunctional workplace \n \nWhen a supervisor plays favorites, it may create disgruntled employees. Those that see themselves as being passed over will distrust the organization and supervisor. The supervisor will not command the respect necessary for his or her role. These employees may begin to put less effort into their work because they feel it goes unnoticed. They are thinking, \u201cWhy bother?\u201d \n \nThe supervisor\u2019s \u201cbuddy\u201d may begin to feel the liberty to slack off because he or she feels protected. There is no motivation to improve since the special treatment is not contingent upon work performance. \n \nRewards not based on merit can create a chilling effect on teamwork since the favored employee may begin to feel entitled. \n \nEven within the healthiest of work environments, companies see turnover. It is best to avoid unfair favoritism if you expect to retain qualified employees. \n \nAlso, keep in mind when someone is promoted out of unfair favoritism, an ill-equipped supervisor may put your company\u2019s reputation and safety at risk. \n \nDevelop a policy \n \nOften called a \u201cworkplace relationship policy,\u201d it is one means of preventing and limiting favoritism. \n \nWhether creating a new policy or re-evaluating an existing one, a company should examine the effects of workplace favoritism throughout your supervisory chain. One best practice is to have employees identify immediate family members or close relationships to the human resources department. A hiring policy may, for instance, include a statement that you will not create a conflict of interest based on these relationships. Some companies have a policy that warns against supervisors spending too much time with employees outside of work. \n \nWhen drafting a policy, it may be wise to seek legal counsel that is familiar with state and local laws on the topic. If you have a policy in place, make sure supervisors are trained on it and understand the importance of fairness. If a supervisor is accused of a conflict of interest/unfair favoritism, be discreet and talk to the parties privately to determine if the claims are legitimate, violating company policy, and potentially against the law. \n \nOf course, in smaller companies and communities, it may not be feasible to prevent family and/or friends from working together. In those cases, be sure to keep detailed records why someone was promoted or terminated. You want to show decisions were made based on qualifications in the event of a lawsuit. \n \nKathy Close is an editor with J. J. Keller & Associates.

Roughly one in five people represent this minority. \n \nBeing aging and disabled \u2014 even after some great laws have been passed \u2014 still segregates us. Many members of this club, including me, saw the disparity and deprivation of our population, and we sought for better understanding. Thus, we created the Weld Advocacy Network on Disability. \n \nWAND seeks answers for affordable and accessible housing and needs our help. \n \nWAND has been serving the disabled population for 14 years and has always been a place for anyone who\u2019s interested in helping the disabled or has a disability themselves. \n \nWAND was created for many purposes.  First off, it was made to create interaction among all community members and to have a place for all community members to voice public concern. \n \nIn the past, WAND has taken on some tough issues. One such instance is when it dealt with the public transit system. Working with a few key members who foresee safety, accessibility and efficiency, a panel was created and it continues these efforts. \n \nNow a new direction arises. \n \nWAND is well aware our housing situation is in despair. Many consumers show up in hopes of finding housing, yet they are dismayed to find a lack of resources or outrageous prices. \n \nWe seek answers, understanding, data and input from others. \n \nIf you know someone or are someone who has a disability, or even if you\u2019re simply just interested in helping the cause, please come to our monthly WAND meeting. Your input is highly valuable in making changes. \n \nThe meeting Takes Place the fourth Thursday of each month from noon to 1:30 p.m. at Connections for Independent Living, 1331 8th Ave. in Greeley. Snacks are provided. \n \nReceiving help from the people at connections for independent living \n \nThe reason Connections for Independent Living exists is to help those with disabilities in Northern Colorado. \n \nIt is located at 1331 8th Ave. in Greeley. \n \nIt not only helps Weld County residents, but residents of Morgan, Logan, Washington, Sedgwick, Yuma and Phillips counties, as well. \n \nOne of the magical and inspiring promises it brings is a consumer-driven philosophy led by executive director Patricia Ziegler and all of the employees at Connections. \n \nThis nonprofit strives to bring equal access and opportunities for disabled in housing, healthcare, transportation and education along with its core services of independent living skills training, information and referral, peer support, and self/system advocacy.

He started his second semester Jan. 9, where he oversees about 1,000 business undergrads as well as a staff of about 40. \n \nBobrowski has an extensive educational background, earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautical engineering from the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, his master\u2019s in management from Purdue University, and he holds a doctorate in operations management from Indiana University. \n \nPrior to UNC, he served as dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Dayton for four years \u2014 the largest private business school in Ohio. He also had a six-year stint as dean of the College of Business at Auburn University and was at Syracuse University for 14 years, where he was director of the Executive MBA program at Syracuse University and served as associate dean. \n \nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s more. Before all of that, Bobrowski was a business instructor at Indiana University and assistant professor at the University of Oregon. His professional business experience stems from the nine years he worked with companies while in the Air Force \u2014 he reached the rank of captain. \n \nThat\u2019s all probably how he landed a gig at UNC. \n \nThe Tribune recently sat down with Bobrowski to discuss how he ended up at UNC and the plans he has for the Monfort College of Business during his tenure. \n \nQUESTION \u2014 What brought you to UNC? \n \nANSWER \u2014 First off, my deanship was ending at the University of Dayton. The university here contacted me and asked me if I wanted to apply. I\u2019ve been to Colorado many times, obviously, and I was familiar with UNC from the fact they had won the (Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award) several years back. I thought the school offered some opportunities, especially in a vibrant economic area of Colorado. You\u2019ve got a population rate that\u2019s increasing. You\u2019ve got the cluster of the state that lives between Colorado Springs and Fort Collins \u2014 we\u2019re not too far east from Interstate 25. So you have some natural advantages for recruiting students and for keeping close to your alumni. You also have some great advantages in terms of attracting faculty to come here. Those are all big advantages that I think play well at this particular time in this particular college. \n \nQ \u2014 What is something that is appealing to you about the Monfort College of Business? \n \nA \u2014 From my standpoint, the reason business schools exist is because of the students. I know the Monfort College as well as UNC as a whole really shows a caring for their students. You\u2019re not dealing with a 50,000 or 60,000-student university. Students have names. Students are essentially hooked to the faculty in ways that make them build a relationship that not only lasts the four years here, but goes on beyond that time. So when a student is three to five years out of school here and decides to go to graduate school, I don\u2019t think they have a problem calling faculty members to get a recommendations. That\u2019s a very positive thing in my book, in terms of how much a university cares about its students and the graduates it produces. \n \nQ \u2014 What direction do you want to take UNC\u2019s business school? \n \nA \u2014 You have to focus on the things that make you different. For us, we have classrooms that are relatively small. So we have the ability to do a lot more in terms of practice with theory \u2014 in other words, utilizing the classroom and bringing in what some people call \u201clive clients,\u201d rather than looking at textbooks and cases out of textbooks. We\u2019re the only business school in the state of Colorado to be affiliated with a Small Business Development Center that covers the majority of eastern Colorado. Before you can solve a real problem, you have to know what it is, and that\u2019s what students can learn through \u201clive clients.\u201d (The university) can be doing more of this because of who we are. \n \nWhen you start talking about things to change, one of the key elements is to get faculty and staff to start thinking about what they do that\u2019s different, and what they can do more of. We\u2019re in the strategic planning process that will lead to some new initiatives. (The process) will give us some new ideas about what to emphasize, to differentiate the Monfort College from other business colleges in the state, and even around the country.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Katarina Velazquez"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Monfort College of Business\u2019 newest dean boasts strong resume, wants to capitalize on college\u2019s strengths","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Weld","zipCode":"80631","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greeley","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Greeley Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669255","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1081"},"name":"Greeley Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.greeleytribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195092272","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:09:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.greeleytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BIZNewUNCMonfortDean-GDT-012917-1-620x398.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Moeen Ali suffocated India with his offies(Image: SkySports)  \nIt was largely a good week for visiting teams. Four matches were played during this week. In the first T20I between India and England, the visitors thumped India at Kanpur by 7 wickets in a one-sided match of sorts. \n \nSri Lanka pulled off a stunning heist in the penultimate ball of the third T20I against South Africa at Cape Town to register a come-from-behind series win in T20s after being handed a thorough beating in the Tests. At least, they won\u2019t return home empty-handed, even though their defeat in the first ODI against South Africa would be particularly deflating. \n \nPakistan succumbed to a fourth consecutive ODI loss against Australia at the Adelaide Oval to lose the series 1-4. \n \nAs usual, there were some sensational performances.

They want us to pay the extra money when there is not the extra lanes,\" he said.\n\nTransurban and the Andrews government have said freight operators will benefit from the widened tollway, because it will provide quicker and more reliable travel times.\n\nThey have also forecast a reduction in truck traffic on suburban streets due to a 30 per cent increase in capacity.\n\nOnce complete, the project will deliver \"a reduction in commercial vehicles using local roads, as 3000 more commercial vehicles will be able to access the freeway,\" a briefing document for freight operators says.\n\nIt also argued the increase was fair given the damage heavy vehicles do to road surfaces.\n\n\"Trucks cause a significantly greater amount of wear and tear on the freeway network and this is reflected in the truck tolling fee structure,\" the document said.\n\nAbout 26,000 commercial vehicles use CityLink each day. Extra lanes are being added to the Bolte Bridge as part of the CityLink/Tulla widening project. Photo: Justin McManus. Martin Wurt is spokesman for the Maribyrnong Truck Action Group, which has lobbied to reduce truck traffic in Melbourne's inner west.\n\nHe said higher tolls would inevitably cause an increase in suburban truck traffic without truck bans on residential streets.\n\n\"Without truck bans, operators are going to avoid tolls where they can, particularly the smaller owner-operators who don't receive a lot of money for doing the empty container runs,\" Mr Wurt said.\n\nA spokesman for Luke Donnellan, Victoria's roads minister, said the industry had been given two years' warning about the toll increase.\n\n\"Trucking rates are being brought into line with other states and territories \u2013 VicRoads and Transurban have been working with the freight industry over the last two years to ensure they had time to adjust.\" The story first appeared on The Age.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adam Carey"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Big rise in CityLink truck tolls tipped to push heavy vehicles onto local roads","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3350","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Ballarat","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ballarat Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666253","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Ballarat Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thecourier.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195095738","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/cd477594-a07c-49d4-897b-4dde7e9af0aa.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Amit Mishra, Yuzvendra Chahal and Parvez Rasool are the three spinners in India\u2019s T20I squad  What\u2019s the story?  \nFormer Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has urged Virat Kohli\u2019s team to play three spinners in the second T20I against England at Nagpur. The 44-year-old wanted the hosts to drop veteran seamer Ashish Nehra and bring in Amit Mishra for the must-win encounter. \n \n\u201cThe only thing that I would do if I was Kohli is drop a fast bowler and play a spinner. Play Hardik Pandya and probably play one other fast bowler, maybe (Jasprit) Bumrah, and give the other fast bowler a break and do something different to England and make the spinners bowl with the new ball. Chahal is different, he bowls flattish so maybe he can start with the new ball and get the England top order batsmen to think differently\u201d, Ganguly told India Today . \n \nHowever, he admitted, \u201cIt is a big ground in Nagpur but it is a high scoring ground. The game against New Zealand in the T20 World Cup (earlier this year) was a bit different because I have not seen the pitch turn so much in a T20 game and I don't see it turning that much this Sunday either. I think India will have to find the right balance as a bowling unit.\u201d \n In case you didn\u2019t know...  \nThe last couple of international matches at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Nagpur came during the 2016 World T20. After New Zealand\u2019s spin troika of Ish Sodhi, Mitchell Santner and Nathan McCullum famously routed India for 79, Afghanistan\u2019s variety of spinners strangled eventual champions West Indies on another raging turner. \n The heart of the matter  \nOn a green-tinged surface in Kanpur, India went down by seven wickets to Eoin Morgan\u2019s team . Requiring a victory to keep the series alive, the hosts will be hoping for some assistance for their spin bowlers. \n \nIn the first match, Nehra conceded 31 runs from 3 overs while Bumrah was taken apart by Sam Billings thus leaving the spinners with too much to do. Ahead of the Nagpur encounter, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal did not reveal much regarding India\u2019s combination .  \n What\u2019s next?  \nRequiring a victory to keep the series alive, India have to hit the ground running in order to keep the visitors at bay. Opener KL Rahul\u2019s spot could be under threat after a string of low scores while the bowling attack should depend on the surface. \n Sportskeeda\u2019s Take  \nOne of India\u2019s greatest ever captains, Ganguly\u2019s words certainly carry significant weight. Taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of England\u2019s batting lineup, it might not be a bad idea to try and attack them with spin. \n \nFetching more content...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ram Kumar"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sourav Ganguly urges India to play three spinners in Nagpur T20I","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sportskeeda.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"600290580","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"512"},"name":"Sportskeeda.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sportskeeda.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195096002","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T17:14:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Look who\u2019s back in training  What\u2019s the story?  \nFollowing a disastrous few weeks for Real Madrid , where they dropped points in four out of their five matches in all competitions, Zinedine Zidane finally has some good news, with South American duo Marcelo and James Rodriguez returning to training.  \n \nThe Colombian has been sidelined since January 7 th  having picked up a \u2018grade 2 hamstring tear\u2019 but took part in training yesterday morning albeit separately along with Marcelo. The two of them were not a part of the squad training for the La Liga game against Real Sociedad but them being back in the squad for the following few matches is a boost for the French manager.  \n In case you didn\u2019t know...  \nReal Madrid were the only Spanish team unbeaten in Europe all season but a string of poor results started with a 3-3 draw against Sevilla. That was followed by a defeat to the same side three days later in the La Liga \u2013 their first loss of the season under Zidane.  \n \nThey lost another game a further three days later to Celta Vigo at home before beating Malaga \u2013 their first win in four games \u2013 and securing a draw against Celta again \u2013 bowing out on aggregate. \n \nA host of these losses could be credited to the loss of personnel with Marcelo, Isco, James Rodriguez, Raphael Varane, Luka Modric and Alvaro Morata all injured at some time or the other during this stretch.  \n The heart of the matter  \nAccording to one Dr Jose Gonzalez, who writes about Real Madrid for Spanish publication AS, the club have made pre-season training more intense than before under Zinedine Zidane and that\u2019s why the players are suffering from a host of injuries.  \n \n\u201cMadrid made their pre-season much harder and more intense than other years and the results have been enjoyed enthusiastically by the fans. Over Christmas, they had another mini pre-season. And now the injuries are taking their toll,\u201d he said.  \n What\u2019s next?  \nEven though Marcelo and Rodriguez are both back in training, they\u2019re not going to be able to represent the club in the La Liga game this weekend against Real Sociedad. Both of them will, however, be a huge boost for the club in their pursuit of their first La Liga title in almost five years.  \n Spotskeeda\u2019s Take  \nMarcelo and James are both exceptional talents and amongst the best in the world in their positions.

Muller has been unimpressive for Bayern Munich this season  \nWhat\u2019s the story? \n \nBayern Munich boss Carlo Ancelloti has coached and won trophies with the world\u2019s best players, including current Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo . \n \nThe Italian has now possibly stirred up a hornets nest with his latest comments about Bayern Munich star striker, Thomas Muller , comparing him to the world\u2019s best strikers. Speaking to ESPN, Ancelotti said, \u201cI did not see a striker with tactical quality like Muller. He is tactically excellent, and can play any position.\u201d \n \nIn case you didn\u2019t know... \n \nMuller had been part of the Bayern Munich youth setup before being promoted to the senior team by Louis van Gaal in the 2009-10 season as the Bavarians completed a domestic double and reached the Champions League finals. \n \nThe 27-year-old has since gone on to win four more titles with Bayern as well as a World Cup with the national side. Playing a vital role in both teams, Muller has scored more than 150 goals for the German giants while scoring over 35 goals for the national team. \n \nMuller\u2019s output has dipped in Carlo Ancelotti's new-look Bayern Munich side. Having scored just four goals throughout the season, the German raumdeuter is going through what is probably the worst run of form in his career. \n \nThe heart of the matter \n \nCarlo Ancelotti has deployed the German in a variety of roles this season ranging from striker to wide forward and stated that he had not seen a player with tactical qualities like Muller. Standing by his player through his period of bad form, the Italian added that the 27-year-old was mentally strong, who thought positively and was confident in what he did. \n \nAlso read:  Video: How Thomas Muller used his passport to avoid the media \n \nThe Italian, who has previously won Champions League titles as the manager of AC Milan and Real Madrid added that he understood that Muller did not possess a traditional striker\u2019s attributes \u2013 impeccable technique and athleticism \u2013 but he more than made up for that with his tactical prowess. \n \nWhat\u2019s next? \n \nBayern Munich defeated Werder Bremen 2-1 margin in last night\u2019s fixture at the Weserstadion with Arjen Robben and David Alaba scoring for the capital club. Muller will be looking to improve this season\u2019s goal tally as Schalke 04 visit the Allianz Arena next weekend. \n \nSportskeeda\u2019s Take \n \nThomas Muller is a world-class footballer and few attackers in world football have the ability to perceive space the way the German does. His goal drought is a temporary dip in form rather than a decline in the forward\u2019s abilities.

The natural successor to Alexis Sanchez\u2019s throne at Arsenal?  What's the story?   \nArsenal have reportedly entered the race to sign Atletico Madrid forward, Antoine Griezmann , according to a host of British publications this morning. The French forward has been linked with a move to Manchester United but the Gunners are adamant that they'll bid the right amount to try and lure him to the Emirates.  \n \nThe 25-year-old is currently one of the most sought-after forwards in the game thanks to him being a part of the final three in last year's FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or award nominations \u2013 a rare feat for someone who doesn't play for either Barcelona or Real Madrid.  \n In case you didn't know...  \nManchester United and Jose Mourinho have been linked with a move for Griezmann ever since they signed Paul Pogba for a record fee last summer. They're willing to reunite the compatriots on a club level to ensure they can resurrect the club from the nightmare of trophy-less seasons they've endured recently \u2013 barring the sole FA Cup success.  \n \nGriezmann and Pogba guided France to the finals of the UEFA European Championships last summer where they eventually lost to Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal side in the final. Griezmann was also instrumental in helping his current club Atletico Madrid reach the finals of the UEFA Champions League last season \u2013 again losing out to a side with Cristiano Ronaldo in Real Madrid.  \n The heart of the matter  \nArsenal's interest in the former Real Sociedad man seems to stem from the fact that the club might be losing Alexis Sanchez to another European giant in the summer. The Chilean is yet to sign a new long-term contract with the club and with his future in doubt, the club are testing the waters by regularly checking on Griezmann.  \n \nAlso read:  EPL 2016/17: Why Alexis Sanchez should leave Arsenal \n \nBut the 25-year-old isn't the only one Arsenal seem to be interested in. Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus is also seen as a replacement for the Chilean should he decide to call time on his career with the North London giants.  \n \n[embedded content] \n What's next?  \nA bid in the region of £85 million is expected to come from both Manchester United and Arsenal in the summer. Griezmann will have the choice to either play under Jose Mourinho or his compatriot Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.  \n \nArsenal will guarantee more game time for the Frenchman should they lose Sanchez and that could appeal to him. On the other hand, Manchester United could offer more pay and the chance to link up with Paul Pogba \u2013 which is equally attractive. It's two sides to the same coin.  \n Sportskeeda's Take  \nIt's unlikely Arsenal will go in for the Frenchman.

Styles reckons Samoa Joe may appear at the Royal Rumble  \nWhat\u2019s the story? \n \nWWE Champion AJ Styles recently had an interview with Sporting News where he spoke about whether he is actually upset with his positioning on the Royal Rumble poster and when he expects his former TNA associate Samoa Joe to make his main roster debut in the WWE. \n \nIn case you didn\u2019t know\u2026 \n \nStyles and Samoa Joe have known each other since their Ring of Honor days in the early 2000s. Post that, they went on to spend a number of years together as part of the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) roster. During this time, \u2018The Phenomenal One\u2019 and Joe not only engaged in several feuds against each other but also teamed up on quite a few occasions. The two of them also left the company within nearly a year of each other, with AJ Styles departing first. \n \nThe heart of the matter \n \nAsked about his reaction to his placement at the back of the Royal Rumble poster, Styles said that it was the fans that seemed to be more upset than him. According to him, the superstars who are more prominent on the poster are the ones who have been with the company for a long time and people know them more. \n \nHowever, \u2018The Champ That Runs The Camp\u2019 did admit that he was a bit disappointed because the WWE Champion should certainly be somewhere in the front but reckoned that he knew the reason for it. This is what AJ Styles told Sporting News : \n  \n\u201cIt's actually people reacting on Instagram and Twitter showing me. I think they were a little more upset than I was. I get what's going on here on the poster. Those are your stars that have been here for a long time. So I get it. They're in marquee matches as well. They're faces that people recognize. \n \nDon't get me wrong, I'm not happy with it. I think that the WWE Champion should be definitely up front but, at the same time, I understand the reasoning for the poster.\u201d \n  \nSpeaking of former NXT champion Samoa Joe, Styles said that he is an incredible wrestler and one of his best friends. He claimed that he will be on the main roster soon and it may not come as a surprise if \u2018The Submission Specialist\u2019 turns up at the Royal Rumble. \u2018The Face That Runs The Place\u2019 went on to add that even if he doesn\u2019t appear on Sunday, Joe is due to be around very soon. He stated: \n  \n\u201cWell, Joe is an amazing wrestler. There's no doubt about that. Always has been. Joe is one of my really good friends. It's just a matter of time before he's on the roster. It wouldn't surprise me if he showed up on Sunday. \n \nThere's always surprises in the Royal Rumble and you try not to get surprised, you try to see it coming but that's what makes the Royal Rumble so fun. If Joe doesn't show up on Sunday, he'll definitely show up soon. I know it.\u201d \n  \nWhat next? \n \nAJ Styles will be defending his WWE title against 15-time world champion John Cena at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. Considering that Styles and Samoa Joe have been very good friends for a long time, the latter may choose the WWE Championship match as the platform for him to make an impact. \n \nSportskeeda\u2019s Take \n \nIt has been a quick rise to the peak of the WWE for AJ Styles and with the kind of support he has been receiving from the WWE Universe, it may be difficult for the company to take the WWE Championship away from him and hand it to someone else, at least at this point. \n \nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com \n \nFetching more content...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Abhinav Massey"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"WWE News: AJ Styles reveals if he is actually upset with the Royal Rumble poster, talks Samoa Joe\u2019s main roster debut","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sportskeeda.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"600290580","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"512"},"name":"Sportskeeda.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sportskeeda.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195097861","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:32:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Cabal and Spears celebrate their first Grand Slam title as a pair  \n2nd-seeded pair of Sania Mirza and Ivan Dodig went down to unseeded Abigail Spears and Juan Sebastian Cabal in the final of the Australian Open mixed doubles event. \n \nSania was gunning for her 4th Grand Slam mixed doubles title, and her 7th one overall. On the other hand, Dodig was looking for his first mixed doubles Grand Slam trophy. \n \nThe pair started off slowly, going down 4-0 very early in the match, and were never really able to recover after that. They did show some fight in the 2nd set, opening up a 4-1 lead, but some error-prone tennis saw them lose five straight games to lose the set 6-4. \n \nSpears and Cabal looked the better team throughout, enjoying every moment out there. That proved to be the difference, as Sania and Dodig looked to be under tremendous pressure from the word go, making errors that you wouldn't normally associate with them. \n 1st Set  \nThe pair of Ivan Dodig and Sania Mirza got off to a pretty shaky start. With both Dodig and Sania losing serve first up, they found themselves in a big hole at 4-0 down. They seemed to be getting into some rhythm, but it was all too late and the set was already gone. They eventually lost it 6-2. \n \nWith Dodig serving first, the pair quickly went down 0-30, thanks to a couple of brilliant points from Spears/Cabal. But he landed a couple of big first serves to pull it back to 30-30. However, he served a double fault to hand the opponents their first break point chance, which they gladly took, to lead 1-0. \n \nCabal then quickly held serve for 2-0, thanks to some strong serving. There were a few beautiful doubles points in there, with Spears and Cabal coming out on top on most occasions. \n \nSania begun her service game well, opening up a 30-0 lead, but Cabal and Spears showed great touch at the net to take the next four points to go up a double break in the set, leading 3-0. \n \nSpears seemed to have a pretty heavy serve, not allowing Sania and Dodig any chance to make an impact on their returns. In no time, the Indo-Croatian pair found themselves down 4-0. \n \nWith the Croat conjuring up some rhythm on his serve, Mirza/Dodig finally opened their account, holding to trail 1-4. \n \nBut Cabal spoilt any hopes of a comeback, by holding to 15, racking up some rollicking pace on his serves. They led 5-1, just one game away from taking the first set. \n \nMirza found her serve under pressure again, being unable to earn any free points on it at all. But with the help of her huge forehand, she managed to save a set point and hold serve to reduce the deficit to 5-2. \n \nWith Dodig finding empty spaces on the court beautifully with his forehand, the Indo-Croatian pair earned two break points for themselves. But with Sania still struggling with her groundstrokes, they couldn't convert any. And as a result, lost the set 6-2. \n 2nd Set  \nThe pair of Mirza/Dodig started playing with newfound confidence in the 2nd set, carrying over the momentum they had built up in the last few games of the first set. But they gave it away after having built a 4-1 lead. \n \nThe set began with a sumptuous doubles point, with Spears finishing the point by putting away a beautiful volley into the open court. That set the tone for the American-Colombian pair as they set up two break points for themselves on the Dodig serve. But the Croat was up to the task this time, serving an ace and another huge first serve to hold for a 1-0 lead. \n \nIt was the first time that Mirza and Dodig were ahead on the scoreboard in the entire match. The confidence rubbed off on their return games as well, as they hit freely to put the Cabal serve under tremendous pressure, earning a break point on his serve for the first time in the match. On break point, a blistering forehand return by Dodig drew the error from the Spears racquet at the net, opening up a 2-0 lead. \n \nSuddenly, Mirza was serving big too, with Dodig pouncing on weak returns at the net, putting away easy volleys. The Indian held to 15 to extend their lead to 3-0. \n \nDodig's confidence rubbed off on Mirza\u2019s return game as well, as she seemed to be smacking the returns that she's famous for. Despite that, Spears stayed strong to hold for 1-3. \n \nAnother strong service game by Dodig ensured a 4-1 lead. And Cabal returned the favour with a strong hold as well to make it 4-2. \n \nA few pedestrian errors from Mirza on her service game, though, including a double fault, saw her serve being broken to 15. Spears took care of her serve to level things up at 4-4. \n \nDodig's serve absolutely deserted him in the next game. He served three double faults to have his serve broken, allowing Cabal to serve for the championship. \n \nThe Colombian did that without a hiccup, ending Mirza and Dodig's dreams of claiming the trophy. \n \nFetching more content...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Vatsal Tolasaria"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017: Sania Mirza-Ivan Dodig go down in mixed doubles final","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sportskeeda.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"600290580","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"512"},"name":"Sportskeeda.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sportskeeda.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/abigail-spears-and-juan-sebastian-cabal-of-columbia-celebrate-a-point-picture-id632962644?k=6&m=632962644&s=594x594&w=0&h=TJTzPrTLe_SbfFjCuuUGEAMQx-YhTNgYeR4EihxB3GA="],"sequenceId":"695195098376","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:19:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I am the parent of three teenagers, and I know the difficulties that arise when trying to make the right decision for each of my kids. \n \nThese tasks are, of course, exacerbated as each of them are individuals and have their own personality, their own learning style and a unique level of motivation. \n \nI too receive those emails from school about the PAC, PTA, the PTO (if you don\u2019t know what these stand for, you\u2019re probably not a parent), the teacher appreciation dinner, the poinsettia fundraiser for prom, the after prom parent committee, etc, etc.  I can\u2019t do them all; in fact, sometimes I can\u2019t do any.  Or at least that is what I convince myself. \n \nI sit down with one or two of my kiddos at least once weekly and try to show them how I would do algebra, or fill out a family tree.

He notes that he won in the end.\n\nNow the former Liberal, who left the party in 2014 after leaked emails revealed his disparaging and sexist comments about a female Sydney City councillor, is gunning for Nationals MP Michael Johnsen\u2019s seat of Upper Hunter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have some fun,\u201d said Mr Preston, 47, at Elderslie on Friday of his role as Shooters, Fishers and Farmers spokesman for the Hunter, and his run as party candidate against Mr Johnsen at the 2019 NSW election, despite not owning a gun.\n\nThe Upper Hunter is the first of what Shooters, Fishers and Farmers state director Filip Despotoski describes as \u201cwinnable\u201d NSW seats held by Nationals MPs that will be targeted by the party.\n\nIn the 2015 election Mr Johnsen suffered a 20 per cent swing against him after a strong showing by Country Labor candidate and Muswellbrook mayor Martin Rush, leaving the Nationals with a marginal seat after continuously holding the Upper Hunter since 1931.\n\nThe Shooters unveiled plans for the region a day before NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian travelled to Tamworth, and then to Queanbeyan on Sunday, as part of a campaign to \u201creconnect\u201d with regional NSW after the disastrous impact of the Baird Government\u2019s greyhound and council amalgamation decisions in the regions.\n\nMr Preston on Friday used \u201cscandalous\u201d Upper Hunter education figures to declare the seat had \u201cendured years of benign neglect\u201d under the Nationals.\n\n\u201cI looked at the education figures where you\u2019ve got more than 70 per cent of children in some schools in the bottom quarter of students in the state, and I thought \u2018This isn\u2019t bad, this is horrific\u2019,\u201d Mr Preston said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being completely let down by the education system, the National Party and their local MP. These figures are nothing less than scandalous. That will be one of our highest priorities, to address the woeful education outcomes. If you repeated these Upper Hunter numbers in Sydney it would be viewed as some kind of emergency. That is going to stop. We are going to make it stop.\u201d\n\nMr Preston said he was moving to Muswellbrook from Sydney in February. He knew the area after project managing construction of Muswellbrook Fair shopping centre and managing it for several years from 2007. He grew up in the Cowra area, trained as an accountant and worked as a tax specialist in the 1990s.\n\nIt was during this time he was involved in landmark High Court cases dealing with state and territory excises \u2013 first involving X-rated films in a case against the ACT Government, and the second involving tobacco excises against the NSW Government.\n\nThe states and territories lost the second case in 1997, and overnight the basis on which they had levied excises of $4.9 billion a year on tobacco, alcohol and petrol ended. The Federal Government was forced to intervene, collect the funds and return them to the states. Within weeks the Federal Government was considering a report that concluded: \u201cThe present crisis may be the stimulus required to undertake major restructuring of the present pattern of consumption taxation.\u201d\n\nMr Preston confirmed that in 1996 he was arrested and charged with money laundering and conspiring to defraud the State of NSW of $7 million in excises based on his business of buying and selling cigarettes. He and six others were charged despite the earlier launch of the High Court case challenging the rights of the states to charge the tobacco excises.\n\nIn a Fairfax Media report of the controversial case, which included the bugging of Mr Preston\u2019s home, it was noted: \u201cWhen the High Court found the fees were in fact unlawful, the charges against Preston and the six others evaporated.\u201d \n\nMr Preston said it was \u201cnice to be at the centre of a seismic shift in Australian economic life. I\u2019m used to being around the big stuff\u201d.\n\nHe left the Liberal Party in 2014 after publicity about leaked emails between himself and the then Sydney City councillor Edward Mandla in which Mr Preston called a female councillor a \u201ccompany tart\u201d and an \u201cidiot\u201d.\n\nMr Preston was present at a meeting with Mr Mandla and Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Robert Borsak \u2013 who is also an accountant - which eventually led to controversial changes in Sydney City Council elections that gave two votes to businesses. \n\nMr Preston said he joined the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party because it was \u201ca party of policy\u201d, and despite not owning a gun. He planned to buy one, he said.\n\nHe wanted to challenge the Nationals in the seat of Upper Hunter because of evidence of obvious disadvantage in the area, despite the mining boom.\n\n\u201cWe have a view how we want to see the Upper Hunter go forward, especially for young people. For young people at the moment the best part of the Upper Hunter is the road out. We want to give young people aged 18 to 35 a reason to stay,\u201d Mr Preston said.\n\nMr Despotoski said the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party had \u201cvery active branches\u201d in Muswellbrook, Scone and Newcastle. Running a strong candidate in the Upper Hunter would benefit the area, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things that can happen for this area is John running, whether he wins or not, because this is a winnable seat and the Nationals are going to have to fight. We will be looking at running candidates anywhere in regional NSW we think we can win,\u201d Mr Despotoski said.\n\nMichael Johnsen did not respond to Newcastle Herald questions.

Michy Batshuayi completed the scoring with a penalty nine minutes from time. \n \nConte rang the changes ahead of Tuesday's league match at Liverpool and the Chelsea manager said: \"To win away at Liverpool is never easy and we lost the game against them here. \n \n\"It will be a really tough game but after that it will be 15 games to the finish line and you want to continue going this way to keep them in the distance,\" he added of a Liverpool side who are currently 10 points behind Chelsea and will go into Tuesday's match on the back of being knocked out of the FA Cup by second-tier Wolves. \n \n\"They can fight to the end,\" Italian boss Conte insisted. \n \nChelsea have now won 10 successive home games but Pedro and Cesar Azipilicueta were the only likely members of the Blues starting side at Anfield that featured against fellow west London club Brentford. \n \nBut the second string still proved too strong for the Championship team who had no answer to the pace and movement of the hosts. \n - 'Idea of football' -  \n\"The FA Cup is a good opportunity to see the improvement of these young players,\" said Conte. \"I am satisfied with what I saw today. \n \n\"All the players are totally involved in our idea of football \u2013 in our project. It's very important for me. \n \n\"For instance, to score a goal is always important for a forward. Michy works very hard for the team, and is improving,\" he added. \n \nChelsea and Brentford last met in 2013 with the Blues needing a replay at the same stage of the FA Cup to see off the Bees. \n \nA repeat never looked likely on Saturday. Chelsea had scored in their last 40 FA Cup ties, stretching back to 2000, and they continued that run through Willian's early free-kick. \n \nPedro struck before the break and then Ivanovic got into the act before the Serbia defender was fouled for the penalty converted by Batshuayi. \n \n\"I'm pleased for Ivan to score a goal and it's important to evaluate a lot of things,\" said Conte, who was coy over Ivanovic's future. \n \n\"This season he is not playing a lot with us. It's not easy to accept this decision but he knows the situation. Players must make the best decision for him and his family and I'm ready to accept every decision. \n \n\"He deserves great respect for his Chelsea career and he has won a lot.\" \n \nBrentford's biggest task now is to decide whether striker Scott Hogan is given the green light to join West Ham. \n \nHogan is rated at £15 million ($19 million, 17.6 million euros) but West Ham have yet to meet the valuation of fellow London club Brentford. \n \n\"I have no idea what's happening with him,\" said Brentford manager Dean Smith, who brought Hogan off the bench in the 64th minute against Chelsea. \n \n\"I fear interest all the time and I don't know if his valuation will be met. If it's not, then he will remain a Brentford player.\" \n \nAFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Darren WITCOOP"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Liverpool news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Conte readies Chelsea for sterner tests after FA Cup stroll","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Cape Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672929","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Cape Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Soccer","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.capetimes.co.za","publisher":"Independent Online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195117433","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/media/2017/01/08/1483884778265.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Or maybe you\u2019re trying to nail that important client. Hey, you could even be trying to impress a significant other\u2019s parents. Regardless, you need a new suit or, at the very least, a new sportcoat. \n \nBut not just any suit. You need a custom suit \u2014 you\u2019re trying to blow them away, right? But this is a new experience. Where do you start? \n \nB.spoke  clothier and stylist Paige Hutt has tips to help you craft the perfect suit  \u2014 and take care of it. Hutt works exclusively with men, but the advice is also solid for women considering custom threads. \n \nGo for the classic \n \nThese days shorter pants and skinny lapels are all the rage but for how long? Hutt said she warns clients that going trendy means they may be investing $2,000 in a suit that looks dated after a year or two. At the end of the day, the best bet is a classic cut. \n \nBuild your basics \n \nAlthough flamboyant prints can be exciting, Hutt said it\u2019s good to start with a good baseline color. She recommended medium gray, charcoal or navy. \n \nDo a little advance research \n \nIt\u2019s helpful if clients walk in know what they\u2019re looking for. The main question you need to be able to answer: What are you dressing for? A wedding, honeymoon, new job? Knowing this helps a clothier make a suit that fits your needs. \n \nDon\u2019t dry clean too often \n \nIf you send your suit off to the dry cleaner every month you risk breaking down the fabric\u2019s fibers, Hutt said. She recommends dry cleaning only when something is spilled on it, perhaps three or four times a year. Instead, press the suit to give it the crisp look without the harshness of dry cleaning. \n \nInvest in a good hanger \n \nA nice jacket needs a good quality hanger that will support the shoulders.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Danika Worthington"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"5 tips for buying and maintaining the perfect custom suit","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Denver","zipCode":"80202","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Denver","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Denver Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661509","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"35315"},"name":"Denver Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.denverpost.com","publisher":"MediaNews Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bspokestyle.com/"],"sequenceId":"695195130750","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:44Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/paige-hutt-01182017-ja-3242a-001.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\u201d \n \nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships. \n \nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others. \n   Starship Technology spokesman Henry Harris-Burland says the founders are looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry which has seen little efficiency improvement from new technology | © AFP/File | MANDEL NGAN   \nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues. \n \nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland. \n \nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \u201ccustomers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\u201d and collect the goods at the door. \n \n\u2013 Mapping sidewalks \u2013 \n \nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers. \n \nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots. \n \nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector. \n \nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. \n \nStarship says one of its strong points is its \u201cvisual localization\u201d technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets. \n \n\u201cWe can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \n\u201cA lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\u201d \n \nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \u201c99 percent autonomous,\u201d according to the spokesman. \n \n\u201cWe want a human being able to oversee the robot\u2019s journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\u201d he said. \n \nHarris-Burland said the company\u2019s tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism. \n \nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \u201cto the nearest inch,\u201d he said. \n \n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New wave of robots set to deliver the goods","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Estcourt and Midland News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533461454","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Estcourt and Midland News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://estcourtnews.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195139476","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

There is a complete lack of due diligence on the part of the bank coupled with the fact that undue haste was shown while disbursing the initial two tranches of loan amounting to Rs 350 crore. \n \n\"It is apparent that the said loans were disbursed post meeting of Mallya with the then CMD (Yogesh Aggarwal) of the bank on a holiday. It does not need an eagles' eye to decipher the cause of immediate disbursement of the loan amount of Rs 150 crore on October 7, 2009 and Rs 200 crore on November 4, 2009,\" the Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe report, accessed by PTI, said. \n \nThe CBI recently arrested Aggarwal and eight others in this case. \n \nThe report added this specific transaction, where \"substantial amounts\" were sanctioned to KFA, in an ad-hoc basis and without due diligence points to the \"existence of a deep rooted criminal conspiracy between the bank officials and the promoters of KAL (KFA)\". \n \nThe agency, in its report, has appended the statement of the Aggarwal given to ED on March 23 last year wherein he told the Investigating Officer (IO) of the case that in October 2009, Mallya made a telephonic call to his office and requested for an \"urgent meeting the very next day\". \n \n\"As the next day was a holiday, it was pointed out to him... And he could meet at a later day. However, he (Mallya) informed that he was leaving Mumbai next day evening and as the matter was urgent, he would be grateful if he could meet the next day despite it being a holiday to which he (Aggarwal) agreed,\" the ex-CMD said, adding Mallya did meet him the next day along with a former MD and current advisor of the bank and an Executive Director of IDBI. \n \n\"Mallya informed that Ms KAL (KFA) was in a severe crunch and needed funds urgently to keep flying,\" Aggarwal said in his statement. \n \nThe report further goes into the disbursal of these two tranches of loans saying when this happened \"Ms KFA was having negative financials and negative net-worth and being a new client did not satisfy the conditions/norms stipulated in the corporate loan policy of the bank\". \n \n\"However, without due deliberations and without following the standard procedure for sanctioning and disbursal of loan, short term loan was immediately sanctioned by the bank in an undue haste,\" it said. \n \nThe ED probe also found that the considered brand valuation of the KFA, taken as a collateral by the bank for loan security in the said case, was not a sound decision. \n \n\"Investigation revealed that KFA brand was accepted as collateral security and the valuation for Kingfisher brand as accepted by the bank as Rs 3,400 crore without independent verification,\" it said, adding the firm that did the brand valuation had submitted three different amounts of this estimate between 2008-12. \n \n\"Thus, it indicates how volatile is this (brand value) intangible fictitious asset and needs to be evaluated frequently, particularly in aviation sector which itself is very unpredictable and was going through a very rough phase and brand valuation was wholly based on projections provided by Ms KFA. Hence, it would not be prudent to accept brand value of 2008, while considering loan sanction in 2009,\" it said. \n \nED said its \"money trail analysis revealed that out of the total loan of Rs 860.92 crore, sanctioned and disbursed by IDBI, Rs 423 crore has been remitted out of India. The said payments were shown to be made towards aircraft rental leasing and maintenance, servicing and spare parts.\" \n \nThe investigations conducted so far, it said, found KFA along with IDBI bank officials \"criminally conspired to obtain funds to the tune of Rs 860.92 crore despite weak financials, negative net-worth, non-compliance of corporate credit policy of new client, non-quality collateral security and low credit rating of the borrower, out of which Rs 807.82 crore of principal amount remains unpaid.\" \n \nED had registered a criminal case in this deal last year under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and has attached assets to the tune of Rs 9,661 crore till now.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Money laundering news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Vijay Mallya-IDBI bank CMD holiday meeting led to hasty sanction of Rs 350 crore loan: ED","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ZeeNews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657937","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3967"},"name":"ZeeNews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.zeenews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195150112","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2420","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Dungog","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Dungog Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170645834","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dungog Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dungogchronicle.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195150561","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the way we defended, and it took a whole team. When a whole team commits to playing the way we did tonight, good things can happen.\u201d \n\nSenior forward Jasmine Goodwine led the Owls offensively with 16 points on 7-of-12 shooting and surpassed two Rice legends ( Valeriya Berezhynska and Morgan Mayse ) to move to 11th place on the Rice all-time scoring list with 1,089 career points. \n\nTrailing 52-51, Rice got the stop they were looking for with 31 seconds remaining and proceeded to setup the winning score without using a timeout. With the shot clock winding down, junior guard Shani Rainey found Hawkins wide open at the wing and the Fairview, Texas native delivered the game-winning three-pointer. \n\n\u201cThis was such a team win, I didn\u2019t have my best game but my teammates lifted me up,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cEvery timeout we looked at each other and said we had this game. That confidence they had in me, and that we have in each other, really helped us persevere through the highs and the lows tonight. I think that\u2019s what gave me the confidence to make the shot; I knew I had the team behind me.\u201d \n\nFollowing the Hawkins make, Rice then got consecutive stops on the defensive end sandwiched around a Hawkins made free throw to preserve the win. \n\nThe Owls outshot Charlotte from the field (46 percent to 34 percent) and improved to 10-1 this season when they outrebound their opponents with a 38-37 edge on the boards. \n\nRice set the tone in the opening quarter by outscoring the 49ers 14-6, the lowest output by the 49ers in a quarter this season. The Owls defense limited Charlotte to just 17 percent shooting (3-of-18) in the first 10 minutes and Goodwine scored five early points to jumpstart the Rice offense. \n\nCharlotte crept to within 16-12 early in the second quarter but Rice outscored the 49ers 16-11 the rest of the period to take a 32-23 halftime lead. During that stretch sophomore forward Lexie Ducat came off the bench to score 7 points while Rainey added an additional five points. \n\nThe 49ers came out in the second half strong with an 11-0 run over the first three minutes to take their first lead of the evening, 34-32. However, as was the case most of the night, Rice had an answer with a 10-0 spurt of their own centered around three-pointers from Goodwine and Nicole Iademarco . The 49ers made one final push in the quarter to trim the Rice lead to 42-41 entering the fourth quarter. \n\nCharlotte took a 45-43 lead with 7:13 to play and kept that advantage until 1:48 to go when Hawkins\u2019 left-handed layup fell through to give Rice a 51-50 lead.

What level of betrayal or irresponsible strategic posturing by Washington would be serious enough to get a rise out of Canberra? \n    \n Clever or craven: Malcolm Turnbull's soft-shoe shuffle around Donald Trump  \n  exit   \nAustralians are probably wondering what it will take? What breach of national values or irresponsible strategic posturing by Washington will be damaging enough to get a rise out of Canberra? \n \nIt's a serious question. Axing a long-held joint commitment to free trade after leading a 12-nation process in good faith? Demanding a Chinese retreat, from territory to which the United States makes no claim, on pain of military action? Abandoning a non-discriminatory immigration policy, and thus being seen to inflame religious tensions with direct implications for Australia and the rights of its citizens? \n \nAs the Turnbull government feels its way forward with the unpredictable, amateurish presidency of Donald Trump, the answer seems to be none of the above. \n \nAustralians are well versed in the claimed worth of the US-Australian relationship: shared values, compatible cultures, an unshakable adherence to the separation of powers and rule of law, and a rock-solid commitment to the international system for peaceful dispute settlement. \n \nBut even as the notion of \"shared\" values comes under direct assault, and when Australia's national interests are materially harmed, the response from Canberra tends toward the mealy mouthed. When Trump killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it was Labor's fault. \n \nIn its first 10 days, the new administration has proved itself as populist and as myopically nativist as pessimists have feared. \n \nUsing bombast and legally dubious \"executive orders\", Trump has: thrown the switch to protectionism with zero regard for allies and partners alike, flagged a 20 per cent impost on all US imports, threatened to force China back in the South China Sea (again with no regard for the regional consequences of such bellicosity) and, now, has trashed a value central to Australia, the US and most of the democratic world in the form of a non-discriminatory humanitarian-migration policy. \n \nOn Sunday, Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke on the phone for 25 minutes. There are big implications in what was discussed, and not just in what was agreed. Yet those details remain secret. \n \nBut it appears Turnbull was successful in gaining an exemption from Trump to allow the one-off resettlement deal for Manus Island and Nauru refugees to proceed. That is significant, even if, politically, it is a bare minimum for Turnbull's standing publicly, and within his party room. \n \nOne suggestion is that Trump was heartened, perhaps decisively, by the Coalition's (read Tony Abbott's) hard-line border policies, seeing dual interests in this regard. \n \nIn time, Turnbull's delicate, low-key handling of the new broom in Washington may prove clever, even productive. But if the refugee deal ends up being underwhelming, and the early pattern in Washington continues, Australians may well ask who speaks bluntly for their national interest. \n \nThe story Clever or craven: Malcolm Turnbull's soft-shoe shuffle around Donald Trump first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Clever or craven: Malcolm Turnbull's soft-shoe shuffle around Donald Trump","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Latrobe Valley Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694441","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Latrobe Valley Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195170575","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country?

Why kill trees when there are great apps to use instead? \n \nMy journaling app of choice is Bear, a free iOS download. While it\u2019s not specifically a journaling app, its note-taking abilities are fantastic. It can also be used to make a useful journal-like document. \n \nBear has an interface that is so minimalist and simple that it is nearly invisible. The screen is essentially split into three columns: The left sidebar helps manage and organize your notes; the middle area is where the notes are listed by the date they were last modified; and the right side is the main place for note writing and editing. \n \nWhat makes Bear stand out is its tagging system to organize notes. You can use hashtags (#) to label whichever piece of text you like; you can look up notes by typing the hashtags into a search field. Best of all is the nested hashtag system, which lets you make a hashtag like #party/planning or #party/guests \u2014 meaning you can effectively put notes into searchable folders and subfolders by using hashtags. \n \nOnce you get the hang of using hashtags in notes, it becomes very natural to do, and you\u2019ll wonder why all note-taking apps don\u2019t do this. Bear also lets you control the style of notes you make, including some esoteric ones, like formatting for computer code. Photos can be imported into the text, and notes can be exported in a wide variety of formats. \n \nThe app includes helpful guides to using it, and has many free components. Paying to upgrade (a $15 annual fee) unlocks even more features, including cross-device syncing and more themes to change the look of your documents. It is available only on iOS. \n \nIf Bear sounds appealing but you\u2019re an Android user, check out JotterPad. Like Bear, JotterPad is primarily a note-taking app with an intuitive interface that can easily be used to keep a journal. Though it doesn\u2019t have Bear\u2019s flexible hashtag system, it does have other powerful writing, formatting, editing and file exporting tools as well as an automatic saving feature. Many of JotterPad\u2019s features are free. \n \nPenzu is an Android app designed specifically for creating diary entries. Penzu\u2019s interface looks attractive and is easy to use. It lets you make text-based notes, which can have embedded images, and entries can be tagged with labels to group them or to search for similar journal entries in the future. \n \nPenzu\u2019s strongest features are its internet-based syncing (so journal entries can be retrieved via a web-based interface without a smartphone) and its built-in privacy lock. This means you should be able to make journal entries about your feelings and thoughts with abandon, secure in the knowledge that if someone picks up your phone for a casual snoop, they won\u2019t be able to read what you have written. The app is a free download on Android, and there is also an iOS edition. \n \nOn iOS, Grid Diary is another journaling app that makes it easy to type a few sentences a day. This app has a very clean interface and, as its name suggests, is based around creating journal entries in a gridlike pattern. \n \nThe idea is that each element of the grid is supposed to inspire you to make notes about daily experiences in a different way \u2014 prompting you, for example, to think about what you\u2019re grateful for, how you spent your money and how to make tomorrow better. The app\u2019s prompts can be customized, and it has an excellent search feature to easily browse through your memories later. \n \nThe main part of the app is free, and paying $5 to upgrade provides extras like a passcode locking system, cloud syncing and better text formatting options. \n \nNarrate on Android is another journaling app that combines an attractive interface and excellent diary-keeping features that let you embed photos and tags alongside the text of journal entries. There is also the option to use location-based tags, which means you could trace the destinations you wrote about during a vacation, for example. Narrate is a free download. \n \nFinally, check out Moodnotes, a $4 iOS download that offers a completely different take on the idea of journaling by chronicling your day-to-day mood variations. It\u2019s odd at first, but ultimately satisfying.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kit EatonThe New York Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Apps news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Journaling apps that inspire and organize","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195196838","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We offered a few tips on saving money, and setting goals that would seem overwhelming if you broke that big number into a daily savings goal that seemed more doable. \n \nOne reader commented that the list didn't seem exhaustive enough, given the expenses associated with being a first-time buyer. And, that's a fair point: We could have easily written a book on the subject that covered all of the struggles a first-time home buyer will wade through (wait, Ilyce already did) in addition to spending a lot of ink discussing first-time buyer finances. \n \nWhile we chose to focus on a few things that you could do to organize your finances for buying a first home this year, we'd like to share a few other ideas to help you spend less and save more. Since the latest studies show that about 60 percent of Americans still don't have $500 in accessible savings, here are four other ways to raise that kind of money (and more) at almost any income level: \n \n1. Trade paid entertainment options for free entertainment opportunities. Date night can be an expensive proposition. If two people go to see a movie, have something to eat and hire a babysitter, the tab can run in excess of $100. If you do that twice a month, that's $2,400 you're spending over the course of a year. If you simply trade a paid entertainment option (like the movies) for a much lower cost one (a service like Netflix, which costs around $10/month), your savings could be more than $2,000 per year. And, even if you spend some money on ordering in food, your savings will still be more than $1,000 per year. \n \n2. Elevate your at-home cooking skills. We're seeing a lot of ads for services that send you ingredients for a complete cooked-at-home meal. While that sounds like fun, it's actually far less expensive and more creative to research a recipe online, go to the grocery store, and pick out the food you need. Making your own food is far less expensive than going to a restaurant or even ordering in, and it's a far healthier choice. In addition, you'll really learn how to cook, which is a wonderful way to bring people together. How much will you save? Assuming that a mid-level restaurant tab for two people is $40 to $50, cooking at home should save you about $35 to $40 per night. If you make that substitution once a month, you'll save up to $420 per year, or $840 if you eliminate eating out twice a month. \n \n3. Plan regular pot-luck parties. If you have friends you like to see regularly, start a regular dinner club. Whether you're making pizzas from scratch with salad or grilling steak, it'll cost a lot less if everyone chips in rather than meeting at a local bar. Expect to save $250 to $500 per year, or more. \n \n4. Shop your insurance and cell service. Regularly checking the rates with competing insurance companies could give you as much as a 10 to 15 percent break on premiums, according to the Insurance Information Institute. If you have homeowner's insurance, check to see if you qualify for reductions because of home improvements, cessation of smoking, etc. If you have auto insurance, ask if you qualify for a reduction if your children go away to college or move into their own homes. Finally, cellphone services are a very competitive field at the moment. You may be able to save hundreds of dollars a year simply by shopping cellphone plans with competing companies. \n \nContact Ilyce Glink and Samuel J.

He won first prizes in Spain\u2019s Valle de Egues international competition in 2008, Germany\u2019s Ana Amalia contest in 2011, Romania\u2019s Terra Siculorum contest in 2013, Spain\u2019s international competition in Sevilla in 2013 and Jose Tomas contest in 2014, and finally the top prize in the Guitar Foundation of America 2015 International Classical Guitar Competition.  \n \nThat prize won him a 50-concert world tour, including performances at Carnegie Hall and, on Saturday, the opening concert in GuitarSarasota\u2019s 11th annual international classical guitar season.  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d said Garcia in a phone interview from Vancouver, British Columbia, earlier this month. \u201cThe Guitar Foundation of America is the most important guitar competition in the world. Thanks to that I have this big tour. It\u2019s huge, a great opportunity to begin a career.\u201d  \n \nHis program will be \u201cvery eclectic, from Baroque passing through Romantic music to contemporary music. I will play a piece by a contemporary American composer and another by a very good friend in Toulouse,\u201d Garcia\u2019s hometown.  \n \nThree years ago, Vincent Jockin sent Garcia a copy of Moment Musical, Op. 26, No. 4, the composer\u2019s first work for solo guitar. Garcia didn\u2019t know the composer or his work, but was impressed by the piece, and the two became friends. \n \n\u201cI hope he will continue to compose for guitar,\u201d said Garcia. \u201cHe\u2019s very local for me. For my city I\u2019m very proud.\u201d \n \nGarcia, who began playing guitar at age 7, comes from a musical family. His father also plays classical guitar while his mother enjoys singing. \n \n\u201cWhen I was a child I heard the classical guitar in the house and I loved that,\u201d he said.  \n \nHe\u2019s never swerved from that instrument. When he began his conservatory studies, \u201cyou have to discover all the instruments, and you have to choose the one you want to play.\u201d And it was always the guitar. \n \nHis performance in Sarasota will include selections from his recently-released recording, \u201cLayendas,\u201d with music by Albeniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Tarrega, Manjon and Piazzolla. The program also includes Donald Crockett\u2019s \u201cFanfare Studies.\u201d  \n \nWhile his concert tour is a solo act, he often collaborates with other musicians in chamber music performances. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a soloist, you have your space; you can create your own atmosphere on stage. What is really exciting in playing chamber music is you share the experience with other people on stage, which creates a fantastic atmosphere as well, lots of energy.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susan RifeCorrespondent"},"topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"French guitarist strums his way to international acclaim","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195202658","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There are more important forecasts to consider as fractious factions face off on Feb. 2, Groundhog Day, over who has the superior groundhog. OK, I know I write about this every year, but I think it adds some lightheartedness to the somberness of investment analysis. \n \nPeacefully sleeping members of Marmota monax are yanked out of their comfortable dens to view their shadows, the purpose being to predict the weather six weeks into the future. \n \nStaten Island Chuck is up against the powerful PR machine of Punxsutawney Phil and his 130th annual forecast. Unfortunately, Staten Island Chuck has never had the smoothest of relationships with New York mayors. In 2009, he took a chunk out of the finger of then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \n \nTwo years ago, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped Chuck after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of winter, and Chuck died several days later of internal injuries. \n \nBut wait, it appears that Chuck was not, in fact, Chuck at all, but a female stand-in named Charlotte, brought in to prevent another finger-chewing \u201cincident.\u201d So, Chuck lives on and will hopefully take a more tasteful approach to government officials. \n \nA mayor in Wisconsin learned a valuable lesson about his city's weather predictor. It seems that Jimmy, the official groundhog in Sun Prairie, was being held too close to the mayor\u2019s face when it promptly bit his honor's ear. Maybe groundhogs are trying to tell us something and not about the weather but rather sleep related. \n \nMeanwhile, General Beauregard Lee of Georgia, who holds \u201chonorary doctorates\u201d from the University of Georgia and Georgia State in \"Weather Prognostication,\" must compete with Sir Walter Wally of North Carolina. \n \nBy way of full disclosure, the University of Georgia tersely informed me a couple of years ago, that academic recognition of such magnitude would not have been bestowed on a groundhog. I did not mean to imply that Beauregard had really been awarded such a degree. After all, he never actually put it on his curriculum vitae. \n \nDesirous of taking advantage of the groundswell of groundhog controversy but with no groundhog of its own to roust, Florida at one time decided to \u201cborrow\u201d one, devising an ad campaign indicating that Punxsutawney Phil had exited stage right in search of warmer digs. \n \nThe recent weather up north would have sent any enterprising groundhog southbound. Yet Phil's handlers were not amused, muttering something about \u201ctrademark violation,\u201d and the promotion died an early death, unlike 130-year-old Punxsutawney Phil. \n \nGiven the level of expertise most groundhogs have with the English language, not to mention meteorology, there is probably some doubt as to the scientific strength of this forecasting approach. Unfortunately, many of Wall Street\u2019s prognosticators are in the same league as your local groundhog. \n \nTheir idea is that the Super Bowl can foretell the stock market\u2019s future. If the team from the NFC \u2014 the old NFL \u2014 wins, it will be an up year for the market. If a team from the AFC \u2014 the old AFL \u2014 is victorious, it foretells a bear market. The Super Bowl Indicator has about an 80 percent accuracy rate. \n \nTherefore, if you are invested in stocks and want to see a bull market this year, you should root for the Atlanta Falcons. If you are short the market and want to see it fall, root for the New England Patriots. \n \nMeanwhile, there is a modicum of statistical data that correlates market aberrations with certain calendar events. For example, the so-called January effect, where January stock prices supposedly forecast the market's performance for the remaining months of the year. Ouch! Before you start placing trade orders, consider that 20 years ago, David Leinweber, a visiting economist at Caltech, determined that butter production in Bangladesh had a statistically significant correlation (an r-squared of 99 percent for you math buffs) with the S&P 500 index. And he still receives requests for current butter production numbers, as do I. \n \nLauren Rudd is president of Rudd International, an asset management firm.

The proliferation of social media platforms has give people greater ability to connect with others and publish their own content. And true to form, when it comes to social media in law enforcement, the SMILE pioneers at Toronto Police Service, are taking more than a few arrows in the back. \n For the TPS, it didn\u2019t start with G20.  \nWind the clock back to May when 18 y.o. Junior Alexander Manon died while being pursued by police. The cops are unable to comment by law due to an independent investigation, but thousands of members of the court of public opinion say the cops killed him. The matter is under investigation by the civilian \u201cSpecial Investigations Unit\u201d (SIU). Meanwhile, several Facebook groups have surfaced as part of a campaign to blast the TPS, one with close to 21,000 members. It\u2019s calling for rallies and for members to sign a petition. \n\n \nThe Toronto Police Association has called upon the SIU to release the findings of its investigation. The SIU has reportedly had the autopsy results for weeks. But they\u2019re not acting and the TPS can\u2019t do anything but take a very public beating in social media. The lives of the officers who work in the Division involved have literally been threatened and yet all they can do is wait for official results of the SIU investigation. A review of the members of the anti-police group on Facebook reveals that many TPS officers have joined the group, presumably to keep informed of the sentiments of the community. \n \nToronto Police\u2019s Social Media Officer Scott Mills was encouraged by his commanders to post a comment indicating how to report to the police any information regarding the event. Mills has spent years building relationships through social media with the same citizens who are now joining forces against the TPS. Prior to becoming the force\u2019s social media officer in April, he was a gang and youth officer and was highly and unusually effective at using social media tools to build relationships \n \nWhether Mills\u2019 hard work has truly vaporized is unlikely. Given that he built relationships, some very deep, with some of the same people who are now attacking TPS, he has that to call upon. It will be a long haul, \u201cbut we\u2019ll do it, it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work\u201d, said Mills. \n The G20 is the same, but Different  \nAhead of the G20 events, the TPS provided a \u201csocial media guide\u201d and provided officers to monitor and engage in social media as part of its G20 strategy. Throughout the preceding week and over the weekend of the summit, TPS monitored and mined social media not only to engage with protesters and observers, but also to gain intelligence as to what those with criminal intent were up to. Here again, social media was used against the Toronto Police Service. But this time TPS can, and IS, using social media to engage and interact and in some cases, solidify support. \n  \nThey [peaceful protestors] don\u2019t understand for example, why they were boxed in by police during the event at Queen and Spadina. We had good reason to do that, because the same Black Bloc tactics that led to police cars burned and businesses vandalized the day before were being seen by officers and they decided to be safe rather than sorry. \n~Constable Scott Mills \n  \nIt will be a long time, if ever, anyone who was there or who followed it from miles away will forget the stories and the images from June 26th and 27th. It was a turbulent, violent and riotous weekend for the city of Toronto. TPS arrested approximately 900 people. A few of those arrested were journalists and many were peaceful protestors, a fact TPS acknowledges. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand for example, why they were boxed in by police during the event at Queen and Spadina. We had good reason to do that, because the same Black Bloc tactics that led to police cars burned and businesses vandalized the day before were being seen by officers and they decided to be safe rather than sorry\u201d, said Mills. To be sure, violent protesters were plentiful as well, such as those who identify with the beliefs of the Black Bloc ideology.. \n \nSeveral police cruisers were burned, in some case other cruisers\u2019 windshields bashed in by protesters while the driver was still inside. \n \n\n \nAS far as social media goes, TPS paid attention most particularly to Twitter. Mills said \u201cmy biggest challenge was volume\u201d adding that he read and responded to upwards of 200 messages a day on Twitter alone, and wasn\u2019t watching Facebook where copious negative (as well as positive) comments were coming in. He said, \u201cit finally got to the point where members of the public asked us to remove from Facebook some of the bad comments from the anarchists\u201d. Mills who staunchly believes in \u201cletting the people speak\u201d took the comments down but said \u201cwe split the page, so they\u2019re still posting criticism but our message isn\u2019t getting lost either\u201d. \n \n\nOver the weekend, TPS shut down its Facebook wall while they dealt with Twitter activity, \u201cWe never want to shut down the wall but we had to disengage it until we could monitor it 24/7 again. There will certainly be some best practices that come out of this\u201d said Mills. \n  \nTim and Scott are TPS social media trail blazers. Because of their great work I hope to expand our work with social media. \n~Dep Chief Peter Sloly \n  \nPositive comments in support of TPS are equally plentiful. When TPS asked witnesses to send them information and images of Black Bloc activity, they received so much, Mills had to stop his media activity to spend a couple hours cleaning out his email inbox. On Tuesday (June 29th), at the request of Deputy Chief Peter Sloly, TPS made it easy for citizens to file a complaint against an officer by tweeting a link to the Office of Independent Police Review. \n\n \nMills said he and the other media officers at TPS are handling the situation by \u201ccontinuing to put out the truth and answer as many questions as we can.\u201d And it\u2019s working, sometimes just one person at a time as with this exchange between the Chief and an Ontario man . But for the most part, it\u2019s reinforcement of the right message and reassuring supporters that your agency is on top of its game. Overall, when reasonable citizens see the big picture of what went down and TPS handling of it and really study the communication online, TPS will gain favorable support. Deputy Chief Sloly is grateful the TPS had the services of Constable Scott Mills and Sergeant Tim Burrows as well as others. \u201cTim and Scott are TPS social media trail blazers. Because of their great work I hope to expand our work with social media.\u201d \n #G20 is over but the protests keep going  \nThe members of the G20 have long since returned home and yet many angry people remained. Fifteen hundred of them gathered outside Toronto Police Headquarters on College Street on Monday night (June 28th). Mills was among them, tweeting. \u201cWhen they found out who I was, they wouldn\u2019t shake my hand\u2026 It was a peaceful protest but very hostile toward police.\u201d And he took photos, which are now on the TPS Facebook page. \n \n\n\n \nSome protesters are calling on Police Chief Blair to resign. But Blair defends the actions of his officers and credits social media for TPS\u2019 intelligence gathering, as quoted in the Toronto Sun , \u201cThey got their picture taken, a lot,\u201d he added. \u201cThey used Twitter and other social media to communicate their intent, we have those communications. So they are going to be held accountable for their actions.\u201d \n  \nWe can talk about idealism in social media all we want but the fact is that in police work there is danger and people can get hurt in real life. That will lead to very strong feelings and commentary whether it\u2019s a protest in the streets or on Facebook. \n~Lon Cohen \n  Lessons Learned  \nSocial media (in its current state) is so new, everyone using it is learning along the way. It\u2019s no different for cops. As Huffington Post and Mashable.com writer Lon Cohen commented when I asked him about TPS\u2019 work in social media, law enforcement is also learning about how to deal with people through the social web. He added \u201cWe can talk about idealism in social media all we want but the fact is that in police work there is danger and people can get hurt in real life. That will lead to very strong feelings and commentary whether it\u2019s a protest in the streets or on Facebook.\u201d \n Social Media isn\u2019t going away. And when it\u2019s used to spread negative commentary about your agency, be ready. The best time to build your support system is before you need it. The worst strategy is not to have one.  Dealing with crisis communications needs to be part of your social media strategy. TPS could have been even better prepared in the online world, but the fact that they produced a social media guide ahead of time and actively monitored social networks with a strategy in place, was remarkable. Ninety percent of what could happen can be predicted and planned for.  Social Media is a highly valuable intelligence-gathering tool. As acknowledged by Chief Blair, the communications are valuable and discoverable and highly relevant to their ongoing investigations.  A crisis is optimum opportunity for reputation management . \u201cWhen the dust settles\u201d TPS stands to gain ground with the citizens of Toronto for being responsive and engaging and abundantly sharing information.  Don\u2019t underestimate staffing requirements. You\u2019ve heard it before, the tools are free but knowing how to use them and paying the people who do, costs money. Sometimes a significant amount.  Engagement is king. TPS was ready to communicate and did so with anyone and everyone who engaged them. If instead, they used Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and the rest only to distribute and not receive, they would have missed a huge opportunity.  Use social media for internal communication. If rank and file Toronto police officers also followed the TPS social media messages, TPS feels they would also benefited from receiving the info being put out to the public.  Set expectations for officers re: photographs. Some disagreements arose when officers\u2019 photos were taken even when the photographers were just tourists or onlookers. Not all officers at G20 understood that when in a public place, people taking their photographs for non-intelligence gathering reasons is o.k.  For the TPS The G20 is not over  \nThe officers I\u2019ve had contact with are shell-shocked, but they press on. The protests continue and the TPS continues to perform its duties and continues to try to improve communication with the citizenry.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Social media news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Economics news","group":"Society"}],"title":"When cops are attacked with social media: eight lessons learned at G20","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ConnectedCOPS.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170677298","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ConnectedCOPS.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Law"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.connectedcops.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=4829&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0","http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=4832&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0","http://www.torontosun.com/news/g20/2010/06/28/14549271.html","http://www.huffingtonpost.com/","http://www.mashable.com/"],"sequenceId":"695195206199","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This will have an equal appeal to people born 40 years after the Beatles broke up.\u201d  \n \nThe title of the Pops\u2019 upcoming concert tour in Florida, which will stop in Sarasota at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall on Feb. 2, is a bit of a marketing misnomer. While iconic music by the Beatles will form the backbone of the second act, the concert\u2019s overall theme is a broader definition of the British Invasion, starting with classical British music and then moving into British rock \u2019n roll, \u201ca lot of things that influenced music over here,\u201d said Lockhart.  \n \nThe concert will open with Elgar\u2019s \u201cPomp and Circumstance,\u201d portions of which are known to everyone who\u2019s ever attended a high school commencement ceremony; \u201cWater Music\u201d by Handel (\u201ca good German coming to British shores and becoming more British than British\u201d); and Benjamin Britten\u2019s \u201cA Young Person\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra,\u201d narrated by author and actor John Hodgman, well known for his work on Jon Stewart\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d  \n \nThe Britten work, said Lockhart, \u201chas always suffered from, in my humble opinion, a rather lame narration.\u201d Hodgman offers \u201ca new and perhaps more contemporary look at the orchestra\u2019s instruments and the characters who play them; a really hysterical march through the orchestra.\u201d  \n \nThe second act will focus on Pops arrangements of the best of the Beatles and other British rock bands, including The Who and Led Zeppelin.  \n \n\u201cThe Pops were probably the first orchestra to play the Beatles,\u201d said Lockhart, referring to legendary Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler, who led the orchestra from 1930 to 1979. Fiedler and the Pops recorded an album of Beatles music in 1967.  \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t play those arrangements any more,\u201d said Lockhart, saying they sounded \u201ca little naive. It\u2019s very difficult translating rock music to an orchestra.  \n \n\u201cIn the early 1960s when the basic sound of contemporary music moved from the big lush arrangements of Nelson Riddle to a lighter, tighter, more electronic, more rhythm-driven sound, the process of translating became more difficult.  \n \nThe \u201cimmediacy and gutsiness\u201d of rock music was a poor fit with traditional orchestras, which tended to turn rock \u201cinto elevator music.\u201d \n \nBut, he said, \u201cthe great thing is, akin to what Gershwin did in the 1920s with jazz, we have orchestrators who grew up with rock \u2019n roll in their DNA.\u201d  \n \nAnd as bands like the Beatles moved from the simpler arrangements of \u201cI Wanna Hold Your Hand\u201d to the more complex sounds of \u201cThe Long and Winding Road,\u201d the task of orchestrators got easier.  \n \nLockhart\u2019s favorites in the Pops\u2019 rock selections are \u201cHere Comes the Sun,\u201d arranged by Nashville arranger Rob Mathes, and The Who\u2019s Overture to \u201cTommy.\u201d  \n \n\u201cThe complexity of the Beatles\u2019 own arrangements really make these pieces a gold mine for orchestration,\u201d he said. The Who\u2019s overture has a \u201chuge brass chorale in it\u201d which \u201cmakes total sense to put that on an orchestra.\u201d  \n \nAnd while the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and The Who might not meet the definition of brand-new rock, Lockhart said he\u2019s always on the lookout for new music to incorporate into the Pops\u2019 programming.  \n \n\u201cIn every generation there is contemporary popular music that has thought behind it, creative process behind it. We do try hard to find them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have collaborated with indie artists of all sorts. That\u2019s not the sort of program we\u2019d tend to take to Florida, if you know what I mean.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susan RifeCorrespondent"},"topics":[{"name":"Boston news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"UK news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boston Pops salute the Beatles and an enduring British invasion","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195211204","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But this winter, she and her partner, Herbert Yarbrough, signed up to test a telepresence robot in their retirement community, the Heritage Downtown, in Walnut Creek, California.  \n \nTheir new pal has a screen for a head and scuttles around on wheels. The lure was being able to connect more easily with their families via video calls. \n \nThe couple were immediately smitten. They have named the robot Jimmy. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy name to remember,\u201d said Duncan, 86, a former real estate broker. Yarbrough, 89, takes the robot on the elevator to pick up breakfast downstairs. \n \n\u201cWe want to keep up on technology,\u201d said Duncan, who longs for a self-driving car. \u201cA lot of older people are isolated from people and ideas. Now we\u2019re on the cutting edge.\u201d \n \nRosie, the robot from \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d has arrived. \n \nEarly adopters like Duncan are on the front lines of testing new technologies that some experts say are set to upend a few of the constants of retirement. Eager not to be left behind, retirement communities are increasingly serving as testing grounds that vet winners and losers. \n \nSome simple tools that can help older adults are already mass-market consumer items, such as Amazon\u2019s personal assistant, Alexa. Other inventions, such as virtual reality technologies and robotic limbs, are still in their early days but could soon provide more freedom, resources and care to retirees. \nWays to delight \nSome technologists see the most promise in the social dimensions. For too long, technology has been chasing problems rather than trying to delight human beings, said Joseph Coughlin, director of the AgeLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cWhere are the devices that help us learn and expand our horizons?\u201d \n \nVirtual reality, for example, can entertain, educate and engage us, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for young and old alike,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s enjoyed, not needed. That\u2019s the high ground.\u201d These devices will especially help augment the adult child\u2019s caregiver role. \n \nThuc Vu, co-founder of OhmniLabs, helped invent the Ohmni robot that is Duncan and Yarbrough\u2019s companion. \n \nVu, who has a doctorate in computer science from Stanford, sees consumer robotics as the next big technology wave. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge senior population, but isolation and loneliness are still common. And we\u2019re also running out of caregivers, since most of them are getting older.\u201d \n \nThe OhmniLabs robot was designed with the techno-averse in mind and requires limited computer knowledge. It\u2019s connected to Wi-Fi and operated remotely. In its next iteration, the company is working on training the robot to pick up objects. \u201cIn five years, it will be able to wash dishes, do laundry and clean the house,\u201d Vu said. \nMore accessible care \nThis year, OhmniLabs robots will be offered by a consumer health firm, Home Care Assistance, to retirement communities and people aging in place. The yearly cost is about 20 percent of the cost, on average, of hiring full-time caregivers, according to Lily Sarafan, chief executive of Home Care Assistance. \n \n\u201cIn five to seven years, caregiving will shift,\u201d Sarafan said. \u201cAnd a lot of home automation will become more mainstream.\u201d \n \nDigital health means more attention to senior care, said Sarafan, who is an active tech investor and a mentor at StartX. \u201cOtherwise, aging is a huge challenge.\u201d \n \nBrookdale Senior Living, which has over 1,000 residential communities, is aggressively testing new technology. Its Entrepreneur in Residence program invites startups into its communities for short stays to test new gadgets. They include smart-medication devices, virtual reality and family connection apps. \n \nOlder adults at Brookdale are eager to offer feedback, said Andrew Smith, the company\u2019s director of strategy and innovation. And entrepreneurs also get firsthand experiences with an aging population that has to adapt to their ideas. \n \n\u201cTechnology will change the way people age in America,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to drive every dimension of health or social isolation. Nursing homes were once where you\u2019d go to die.\u201d \n \nSome devices miss their mark. Brookdale residents tested a body dryer, which is widely used at amusement parks to dry people after a ride. \u201cBut no one would come near it,\u201d Smith said. \nVirtual reality travel \nVirtual reality, however, has touched residents\u2019 hearts. \u201cSeniors were weeping to see their old homes again,\u201d Smith said. \n \nVirtual reality rejuvenated life for Abdus Shakur, 67, who lives in a Brookdale residence in Quincy, Massachusetts. A classically trained chef, Shakur opted to take a virtual trip to a Creole restaurant in Berlin, where he once worked. \n \nBy wearing the VR headset, he could check out the current menu and look at the restaurant\u2019s colorful redesign. \n \nShakur also took virtual trips to beaches in the Caribbean, where he felt the sand under his feet and saw schools of fish under water. \n \n\u201cI felt like I was right there,\u201d said Shakur, who has a bad heart and doesn\u2019t travel as much as he used to. \u201cIt gives you so much hope. I can sit in my living room and go all over the world.\u201d \n \nShakur\u2019s headset was developed by Rendever after a co-founder\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s dementia led to communication problems. \n \n\u201cSo we\u2019re using VR as a mechanism to enhance life,\u201d said Dennis Lally, CEO and co-founder of Rendever, an MIT company based in Boston. The founders spent hundreds of hours living with residents in Massachusetts to understand their needs, and a crucial lesson was that they often talked about travel. \n \n\u201cSensory stimulation is important,\u201d Lally said. \u201cAnd VR creates a sense of wonder for the world again.\u201d Taking people back in time can even prompt more memories in people with cognitive impairments. \nTrying brands and devices \nChanging ideas about aging are also affecting how products are branded, said Stephen Johnston, co-founder of the technology accelerator Aging2.0. Some, however, still have a learning curve, such as one startup that used the word \u201cgrandparent\u201d in its name. \u201cBut not every older person is a grandparent,\u201d Johnston said. \n \nFront Porch, which operates retirement communities in California, has been one of the most actively involved in trying out the devices, he said. \n \nThe company\u2019s Center for Technology Innovation and Wellbeing has tested many products and has been able to provide feedback to inventors and marketers on what works. A robot baby seal named Paro, for example, helped people with dementia communicate, while virtual reality that stimulates the mind worked well, too. \n \nThis year, Front Porch will test ride-sharing services and Amazon Echo as part of the internet of things that can operate smart devices. \u201cEcho can reach people who are visually impaired,\u201d said Davis Park, director of the Front Porch Center for Innovation and Wellbeing. \u201cAnd it can be interactive. It\u2019s a form of companionship.\u201d \n \nFront Porch residents have also tested another Silicon Valley invention: the AlterG Bionic Leg, a wearable rehabilitation robotic device that is therapeutic. \n \nSara Carter, 82, who has had knee replacements and lives in a Front Porch community called Sunny View, tried the bionic leg. After walking back and forth with it, she said it was a useful tool. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m interested in technology that helps people,\u201d said Carter, who doesn\u2019t own a smartphone. The bionic leg, which was later altered to be lighter and to fit better, is now on the market. \n \nRetirement communities can be the perfect proving grounds for such devices that will help an aging population, officials say. \n \n\u201cThere has been a big problem with asking seniors about these products,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe\u2019re a bridge.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Constance GustkeThe New York Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: seniors news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"New tech finding ways to serve older people","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195221486","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And leaders throughout the industry, where foreign-born entrepreneurs are central to its success, condemned the decree. \n \nThe executive order bans about 134 million people from entering the U.S. \n \nGoogle sent out a memo to its employees urging anyone with a visa or green card from one of the banned countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- to cancel any travel plans. \n \n\"Please do not travel outside of the U.S. until the ban is lifted. While the entry restriction is currently only in place for 90 days, it could be extended with little or no warning,\" the memo, which was reviewed by CNN, reads. \n \nThe company issued a statement Saturday, saying it's \"concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US.\" Google also vowed to \"continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\" \n \nOn Friday night, Google cofounder Sergey Brin was at San Francisco International Airport with crowds of protesters. He declined to comment and told CNN that he was there in a personal capacity, but is himself an immigrant from Russia. \n \nApple CEO Tim Cook issued a letter reacting to what he called \"deep concerns\" among employees. He assured them Apple does not support Trump's policy. \"Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,\" he wrote in an email obtained by CNN. \n \n\"There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them,\" Cook's email reads. \"Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship.\" \n \nMicrosoft -- which is run by Satya Nadella, who immigrated to the U.S. from India -- told employees Saturday that the company is committed to providing \"legal advice and assistance\" to its 76 employees that are citizens of the affected countries. \n \n\"We appreciate that immigration issues are important to a great many people across Microsoft at a principled and even personal level, regardless of whether they personally are immigrants,\" Microsoft executive Brad Smith said in an email to employees, which was shared by Nadella on LinkedIn. \n \nThe email also said the company will advocate for \"protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\" Nadella has previously spoken out on the issue. \n \nAmazon also sent an email to employees about the potential implications of Trump's order and offered legal assistance to employees who might be impacted. \n \n\"As we've grown the company, we've worked hard to attract talented people from all over the world, and we believe this is one of the things that makes Amazon great -- a diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers,\" according to the email sent by Beth Galetti, Amazon's vice president of HR. \n \nImmigrants and their families have a long history of starting and running American businesses. \n \nA 2011 report from the Partnership for a New American Economy found that about 45% of high-tech companies in the Fortune 500 were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants. \n \nThat list includes highly influential founders from some of the banned countries: Apple founder Steve Jobs was the child of Syrian immigrants, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar is the child of Iranian parents, and Oracle's Bob Miner is also Iranian. \n \nOmidyar on Saturday called Trump's decision \"simple bigotry.\" \n \nIn a tweet on Saturday, Square CEO Jack Dorsey said the ban's \"humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting.\" \n \nWhen asked by CNN about the impact of immigration restrictions on innovation, Dorsey said: \"We benefit from immigration. We benefit from diversity. We benefit from including more people because we see different perspectives.\" \n \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook Friday, citing the importance of immigration in his own life's story. \n \n\"We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"That's who we are. Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today.\" \n \nFacebook said in a statement Saturday that it's \"assessing the impact [of the ban] on our workforce and determining how best to protect our people and their families from any adverse effects.\" \n \nIn a blog post, Y Combinator President Sam Altman called on the tech community to rally against Trump -- calling the president's actions \"a first step toward a further reduction in rights.\" \n \n\"This is not just a Muslim ban. This is a breach of America's contract with all the immigrants in the nation,\" Altman wrote. \n \nHe called on people to \"not demonize Trump voters,\" but urged leaders in the community to publicly denounce Trump's actions \"at a minimum.\" And, he said, \"employees should push their companies to figure out what actions they can take.\" \n \nExecutives from LinkedIn, Yelp, Foursquare and Salesforce lambasted Trump's decision via Twitter on Saturday. \n \nThe ban sparked fear among Muslims in the industry. \n \n\"I'm horrified. As an immigrant who came through the green card process, the idea that it could be invalidated and you could be stranded away from home is truly shocking,\" an employee of one major tech firm said. \"I'm a citizen now, but I have a lot of friends who aren't and who are worried. Even if you're not from one of those countries, if you're Muslim, who knows what could be next?\" \n \nSome in tech also vowed to help fund the suit against Trump and support refugees who were in Limbo. \n \nShark Tank star and tech investor Chris Sacca promised to match up to $50,000 worth of donations to the ACLU. \n \nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky posted on Facebook that his company would house any refugees who were stuck in limbo because of the executive order. \n \n\"Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone else who needs it in the event they are denied the ability to board a U.S.-bound flight and are not in your city/country of residence,\" he posted. He included his email address for anyone who needed assistance. \n \nBox CEO Aaron Levie also promised to donate, and in an email sent to CNNMoney Saturday, Levie also called the executive order \"immoral.\" \n \n\"It's also deeply flawed as a matter of policy and will undermine our economy and security in the long-term if maintained,\" Levie wrote. \"America's principles should be about openness and inclusion, and we're sending the wrong message to our communities and the rest of the world about maintaining these principles.\" \n \nSelena Larson contributed reporting.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Facebook news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Tech leaders line up against Trump's immigrant ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Duval","zipCode":"32207","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jacksonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News4Jax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658107","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"250"},"name":"News4Jax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news4jax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195222664","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Yes, Trump won the election, but it is not about this election. It is about the future of this country. It is about whether we have legal votes for president or votes that have been flooded by dead people, illegal immigrants or people voting several times. It is about future elections. The American people are not as dumb as the Democrats thought, and that showed up when Trump got elected. \n \nPromise broken \n \nI saw in the News-Press that President Trump is backing away from his promise to introduce a constitutional amendment to limit terms for congressmen and senators. That is one more of his promises he is breaking. This is one of the most important measures that need to be in even though the Republican congress would probably defeat it. It would be a good start. \n \nFix the potholes \n \nI sure hope that the City of St. Joseph and MoDOT fix the holes in our roads before the 50,000 to 500,000 people come here to view the solar eclipse in August. How embarrassing it will be for our city and state when the visitors have to dodge huge potholes when traveling to restaurants, shops, hotels and viewing sites? \n \nPervasive intolerance  \n \nTheir words and conduct since the presidential election continue to reveal a pervasive intolerance among so-called progressives to any opinion other than their own. \n \nKeep Canada friendly \n \nThe estimated cost to build the wall between the United States and Mexico is $12 to $14 billion. I am glad Trump doesn\u2019t have anything against the Canadians, because if he wanted to build that wall it would be five times as much money. \n \nClean it up \n \nRegarding the safety issue with Pat Jones and her voting negative, why can\u2019t she clean up her own neighborhood of Industrial City, right down the street from her? It is a mess, there is junk, big trucks parked, trailers, that bar is stacked full in there. Something needs to be done with that area. \n \nMore disgrace \n \nIn reference to \"A disgrace,\" what about all the Republicans who didn\u2019t go to the inauguration, all the Republicans who had been against Trump and then did a 180-degree turn around? They are disgraceful too. \n \nBeating around the bush \n \nIn reference to David Muir\u2019s interview with Trump Wednesday night, I thought Trump was very rude to David. He beat around the bush many times. Every question that David asked him, he could give very few answers. Everything was \"I\" or \"me,\" and I don\u2019t think that is very cool.

This is why both the flying public and many civic leaders have challenged a proposed massive overhaul of the airport that would make needed improvements but also potentially jeopardize the airport\u2019s prized convenience to air travelers. \n \nThis $1.2 billion project stalled last year after surveys showed a strong majority of Kansas City voters opposed a plan for demolishing the existing terminals and building a larger, single-terminal hub. That plan would require voter approval, new investments from airlines and new user fees from KCI customers from the region. \n \nNow word comes that proponents of an airport overhaul have wised up to political realities. The Kansas City Star reports backers realize they need to do more to win the support of Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, an ardent critic, who has 16 years of seniority in the House and holds seats on important transportation infrastructure and aviation committees. \n \nGraves hails from Tarkio, in far Northwest Missouri, but his district encompasses much of Kansas City. The Star news report suggests boosters of an airport overhaul made a strategic error: \n \n\u201cGraves was cast by airport supporters as a pest rather than someone whose support could help swing public opinion and federal influence in the airport\u2019s favor.\u201d \n \nApparently a new view has taken hold over the last several months. It was affirmed after the election and when it became known KCI could be a candidate for federal funding under President Trump\u2019s proposals for a massive program to replace aging infrastructure. \n \nYou would have to think that money would be welcomed \u2014 and heavily dependent on Graves\u2019 recommendation. \n \nThis is where the tide may turn in favor of the public. Graves\u2019 spokesman told The Star he \u201cisn\u2019t against reasonable renovations at KCI, but in his mind, he needs there to be public buy-in for that to happen.\u201d \n \nThe spokesman adds: \u201cThe way to do that is for the city to start the process over, be more transparent with the public from the get-go, and consider every option.\u201d \n \nGraves is in sync with his constituents on this important issue.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4570","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Gympie","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Guyra Argus","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"271494931","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Guyra Argus","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.guyraargus.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195276916","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Tsering Topgyal  by Mark Bergen and Eric Newcomer  \nAlphabet's Google asked staffers who may have been affected by a new executive order on immigration to return to the US quickly, joining a growing number of technology executives voicing concerns over restrictions that could interfere with how they do business. \n \nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai slammed President Donald Trump's move in a note to employees, telling them that more than 100 company staff had been affected by the order. Microsoft said it was in touch with 76 staffers from the seven countries identified in the executive order. They received a reprieve on Sunday (AEDT) after two judges temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the order that would have led to the removal from US airports of refugees, visa holders and legal US residents from seven mostly Muslim countries. \n \n\"It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\" Pichai wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News . \"We've always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\" \n \nThe comments underscore a growing rift between the Trump administration and several large US technology companies, which employ many immigrants and have lobbied for fewer immigration restrictions. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg voiced concern over the policy on Saturday, and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet that \"closing doors further divides\" people. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet the order's \"humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting\". \n   \nUber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick said at the weekend he planned to outline his misgivings with the order at the first meeting of the Trump administration's business advisory group this week in Washington. \n   Stranded Drivers  \nUber had about a dozen staffers affected by the order, as well as a number of drivers, Kalanick said.  \n \n\"This order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the US will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days,\" he said. He said Uber was working out a plan to compensate those drivers stranded abroad. \n \nAirbnb will provide free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed into the US, Chesky, the home-stay network's CEO, said on Twitter. \"Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing,\" he wrote. \n   Barriers for Talent  \n\"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,\" a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. \"We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\" \n \nSome Google employees were travelling abroad and were trying to get back to the US before the order took effect. The company asked them to reach out to Google's security, travel, and immigration teams for assistance, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person asked not to be identified talking about internal company communications. \n Rushing Home    \nThe employees in question normally work in the US but just happened to be abroad either on work assignments or vacations. One employee rushed back from a trip to New Zealand to make it into the US before the order was signed, Google's Pichai wrote in his memo. \n \n\"We are advising our clients from those seven countries who have green cards or any type of H-1B visa not to travel outside the US,\" said Ava Benach, a partner at immigration law firm Benach Collopy LLP, while noting that the order takes effect immediately. \n \nMicrosoft Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a memo to staff at the weekend that company was working with affected personnel and that it supported immigration policies that \"protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion\". \n \nMicrosoft also affirmed \"the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings\", Smith wrote. \n   \nFacebook's Zuckerberg said he was \"concerned\" by Trump's recent moves to restrict immigration. \n \nA blanket entry ban \"is not the best way to address the country's challenges\", Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter. \n \n\"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US,\" Musk wrote. \"They've done right, not wrong and don't deserve to be rejected.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Facebook news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Tech dismay over immigration order","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Australian Financial Review","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657143","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5304"},"name":"Australian Financial Review","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.afr.com","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195279376","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(1/28/17)\u2014 Concordia held St. Olaf scoreless in the first 8:34 of the second half and went on a 19-0 run over that stretch but it wasn't enough to overcome a sluggish first half and the Cobbers fell 65-62 in Northfield. \n\nEven after trailing by 16 at the half and then again by seven points with just over 4-minutes to play in the second half, Concordia had a chance to tie the game in the final seconds of play. \n\nThe Cobbers were down by three points with 5.9 seconds remaining and had to go the length of the court to get the game-tying 3-pointer. Senior Dylan Alderman was able to make a great move to free himself for a shot from six feet outside the 3-point arc but his shot rattled off the rim and fell off as the horn sounded. \n\nAlderman keyed the comeback in the second half as he scored eight of his game-high 14 points in the final 20 minutes of play. \n\nThe loss ends Concordia's three-game winning streak and drops them to 10-8 overall and 7-6 in the MIAC. The Oles stop their two-game losing skid and are now 8-9 in all games and 6-6 in the MIAC. \n\nThe Cobbers trailed for the entire first half, falling behind 15-4 in the first eight minutes of play. Concordia would shoot only 34.3% (10-for-29) from the floor in the opening period of play. \n\nThe game turned around at the start of the second half when CC scored on seven of nine possessions and turned the 16-point deficit into a three-point lead.     \n\nFrom that point until the 6-minute mark of the second half the teams would produce five tie scores as the game went back and forth. St. Olaf then broke free to take an eight-point lead with under five minutes to play. \n\nConcordia whittled away at the lead and got to within one point with 52-seconds left when junior Guliherme Saad got a pass from Austin Heins and scored on the layup. \n\nThe Cobbers got a steal on the next possession but missed an opportunity to take the lead in the final 10 seconds of play. The Oles grabbed the rebound and then made both foul shots to set up the end-game drama. \n\nConcordia shot 35.6% (21-for-59) from the floor and 25.9% (7-for-27) from outside the arc for the game. \n\nHeins was the only other CC player with more than nine points in the game. He had 11 points and nine rebounds. Zach Kinny put up nine points, six rebounds and five assists. \n\nWHAT'S NEXT: Concordia will have little time to dwell on the game at St. Olaf as they host two games in three days. The Cobbers will square off against St. John's on Monday, Jan. 30 at 7 p.m. and then battle Augsburg on Wednesday, Feb. 1 at 7:45 p.m. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Back-And-Forth Second Half Falls Short","source":{"category":"Academic","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Concordia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170454602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Concordia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.concordiamn.prestosports.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://concordiamn.prestosports.com/sports/mbkb/2016-17/bios/alderman_dylan_n2yb","http://concordiamn.prestosports.com/sports/mbkb/2016-17/bios/heins_austin_inta","http://concordiamn.prestosports.com/sports/mbkb/2016-17/bios/kinny_zach_b6sx"],"sequenceId":"695195283801","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(Menahem Kahana/AFP/) BEIT EL, West Bank \u2013 In a modern building of beige and black stone, hundreds of Jewish students pore over religious texts and learn of their right to settle the land surrounding this hillside settlement, as promised by God to their forefathers. \n\nThe new building for the religious seminary, or yeshiva, opened just a month ago, despite controversy over any new construction here. A sign reading \"danger construction\" still hangs on the fence outside. \n\nLocated deep inside the occupied West Bank, near the Palestinian city of Ramallah, the settlement is considered illegal by most of the international community. But still, it has some influential backers, the most famous of whom now sits in the White House. \n\nSeveral of President Trump\u2019s close associates have strong links to the right-wing Zionist community, home to 1,300 families. Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, his former bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman, is president of the American Friends of Bet El Institutions, which raises around $2 million a year in funding. Its website says the group has helped bring about an influx in young couples and is working to create \"facts on the ground\" to prevent international attempts to uproot the community. \n\nThe family of Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner has donated tens of thousands. Trump himself made a $10,000 donation in 2003, his foundation\u2019s tax filings show. Palestinians say these communities present a major barrier to peace and the creation of a contiguous future state. It is a view that much of the world shares. \n\nBut Trump\u2019s ties to the settler movement could upend decades of U.S. policy on dealing with the conflict here, allowing Israel more freedom to build without censure from Washington, which previously considered West Bank settlements \"illegitimate.\" ] The first signs of a shift emerged last week, as Israel made a bold announcement of 2,500 new housing units in West Bank settlements, including some in Beit El. So far the Trump administration has avoided condemning the move.\n\n\"We are now more hopeful,\" Yael Ben-Yashar, who has lived in Beit El for 20 years, acts as the settlements spokeswoman and runs tours, said this week. \"We think it may be a new era.\" \n\nBeit El was established in 1977 by members of a right-wing messianic activist movement determined that Jews return to repopulate Judea and Samaria, the biblical name for the West Bank. Despite restrictions on building, it has burgeoned from a hardscrabble hilltop outpost of a few caravans to a small town dotted with palm trees and a clinic and schools. \n\nThe area of Beit El, meaning \"House of God,\" held particular resonance for the settlers. It was believed to be the site where, according to the Bible, Jacob had his dream of angels ascending and descending a ladder to heaven, when God promised him that his descendants would return to the surrounding land.\n\nAn Israeli soldier standing guard in a monitoring cabin in Beit El. (Menahem Kahana/AFP/) \"Today, in Beit El, we are living that dream,\" Ben-Yashar said from an observation point on top of a water tanker, from which the view stretches from Tel Aviv to the West to Mount Scopus to the south and the Golan Heights to the north. In the center of the viewing platform a mosaic depicts a map of greater Israel.\n\n\"You can see why God promised it here,\" she said. \"You can see it all from here.\"\n\nNearby, down a dirt track, is the smooth flat rock where believers say Jacob slept. The site and the settlement attract about 5,000 visitors a year, said Ben-Yashar.\n\nSome also visit its small winery, run by Hillel Manne and his wife, Nina, who met Friedman when he came to pick grapes several years ago. \n\n\"I think it was just after 2008 because I remember we joked he\u2019d made a lot of money,\" Manne said with a chuckle, referring to Friedman\u2019s work as a bankruptcy lawyer during the financial crash. His wife described Friedman as a \"family person.\" \n\n\"He came with all the family, his wife is wonderful, too,\" she said.\n\nFriedman, the son of an Orthodox rabbi was picked as ambassador by Trump, despite having no diplomatic experience. He has publicly said that the \"two-state narrative\" needs to end, is a staunch supporter of settlements, and has said he expects to work from Jerusalem. A move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has been opposed by Palestinians and would be seen as tacit recognition of Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the contested city. ] But Hillel Manne said he fears that Friedman, and a more sympathetic ear in the White House, still may not be able to change much.\n\n\"It\u2019s good to see people excited,\" he said of Friedman\u2019s appointment. \"But if you want change you\u2019ll need big change at the State Department. The State Department staff, they\u2019ve managed the U.S. to bet on a lot of losers.\"\n\n\"This land was promised to me as a Jew,\" said Nina Manne. \"It is ridiculous that we need to live in this situation. That we have to justify ourselves to be here.\"\n\nBut Beit El was largely established on private Palestinian land that had been designated by the Israeli state for military purposes, according to a report published by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\n\nApproval for 20 new units came last week when the expansion in the West Bank was announced, according to Beit El\u2019s mayor, Shay Alon.\n\nThe plans are \"disastrous\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization\u2019s executive committee, condemning Israeli \"land theft.\" \n\n\"It is evident that Israel is exploiting the inauguration of the new American administration to escalate its violations and the prevention of any existence of a Palestinian state,\" she said in a statement, urging the international community to take action. \n\nFor Alon, however, the expansion plan didn\u2019t go far enough. He said he felt \"ambivalent\" about the news, given that 300 new units in Beit El had been promised when several apartment blocks were razed by the government five years ago.\n\nBuilding permits were restricted for years under former president Barack Obama, and Alon hopes that Friedman \"is the sort of person who can bring about a change.\" \n\nLike other Orthodox residents here, he believes their presence is preordained. Yishai Babad was the ninth family to arrive, setting up a factory that makes tefillin - small leather phylacteries containing verses from the Torah.\n\nHe said Obama \"loved the Arabs and not the Jews,\" but that the incoming administration would make no difference.\n\n\"We don\u2019t believe that the policy towards Beit El is going to change anything, because it\u2019s all written in the scriptures,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve always had difficulties, but all of Israel was built despite the difficulties.\" Read more","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Loveday Morris"},"topics":[{"name":"Top US stories","group":"Top stories"},{"name":"Top stories","group":"Top stories"},{"name":"Palestinian territories news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Inside the contentious Israeli settlement that counts Trump as a donor","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","state":"District of Columbia","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Washington Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587503","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"19007"},"name":"Washington Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.washingtonpost.com","publisher":"Washington Post Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/@LovedayM","https://twitter.com/@reglash","http://www.haaretz.com/secret-israeli-database-reveals-full-extent-of-illegal-settlement-1.266936","https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostworld/"],"sequenceId":"695195285398","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/26/Foreign/Images/AFP_KQ9I2.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It is estimated that up to 25,000 people visit the lake on summer weekends, said a 2014 study. \n \nBut visitors are leaving excessive amounts of litter and garbage in the backcountry. \n \n\u201cOne of the worst [incidents] I have seen was May long weekend 2015,\u201d said Rob Gay, a director of the Regional District of East Kootenay in a statement. \u201c[There was] a big party resulting in three vehicles being burnt, truck loads of waste left after the party and many tents, chairs and sleeping bags burnt.\u201d \n \nGay said May long weekend is a particularly unruly time on the lakeshore. \n \n\u201cMy view is that people have been cooped up all winter and finally get a chance to camp,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the lake is low, boating is not an option so shore parties are the thing to do. Don't get me wrong I have no issue with camping and a few adult drinks [but] some take it to extremes and don't care about our environment.\u201d \n \nIn response, a number of groups have partnered to create the Koocanusa Recreation Steering Committee and the Koocanusa Recreation Public Advisory Group to help address a range of issues related to tourism and recreation in the area. \n \nThe groups are holding a series of open houses to discuss issues associated with recreation use of Crown lands in the Koocanusa area. \n \nOpen houses in the Elk Valley will be held Feb. 7 at the Fernie Family Centre and Feb. 8 at the Jaffray Community Hall from 6 to 8:30 p.m. \n \nThe feedback received will be used to identify the next set of actions to be taken under the Koocanusa Recreation Management Initiative. \n \nThose unable to attend the open houses can complete the Koocanusa Recreation Management Options Survey online.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Koocanusa crackdown","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V0B","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"East Kootenays","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Free Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169705113","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Free Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thefreepress.ca"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195294789","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4570","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Gympie","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Guyra Argus","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"271494931","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Guyra Argus","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.guyraargus.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195297957","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Aggarwal, Chairman and Managing Director, SMC Investments and Advisors, markets might continue their northward movement on the back of budgetary expectations. \n \n\"Nifty is expected to trade in the range of 8,450-8,800 levels; 8,450-8,500 would now be seen as a strong support zone,\" Aggarwal predicted. \n \nApart from the budget, the week ahead will be heavily influenced by the corporate earnings for the third quarter of FY 2017. \n \nCompanies like HDFC, Grasim, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Auto , ICICI Bank and JSW Steel are expected to announce their quarterly results in the coming week. \n \n\"The earnings season so far has offered positive surprises, especially materials and some banks,\" Nevgi said. \n \n\"The demonetisation seem to be have lower than expected negative outcome on earnings.\" \nOn Global level, investors will follow cues such as the US non-farm payroll figure which is expected on February 3rd, 2017. \n \nThe data assumes significance as it shows the economic health of the US and accordingly sets-up expectation for the next round of rate-hike cycle. \n \nA hike in the US interest rates can potentially drive FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) away from emerging markets such as India. \n \nOn technical-levels, the NSE Nifty could attempt to target the next resistance base of 8,678 points and 8,737 points. \n \n\"Crucial supports to watch for any emergence of weakness is at 8,610 points,\" Deepak Jasani, Head - Retail Research, HDFC Securities, told IANS. \n \n\"Markets could be volatile next week on the back of the Union Budget.\" \nFurthermore, the Indian rupee is likely to range between Rs 67.90 and Rs 68.30 to a US dollar during the pre-budget period. \n \n\"In case of a sustained break of 67.90 -- rupee can test 67.30/40 levels. At the same time, a sustained break above 68.50 can cause a test of 68.90/69.00 levels on spot,\" Anindya Banerjee, Associate Vice President for Currency Derivatives with Kotak Securities, told IANS. \n \n\"After rupee, it is the turn of Indian bonds. Indian 10 year would be affected by what is presented in the Union Budget, especially number of gross fiscal deficit.\" \n\"A number closer to 3.5 per cent can be positive for yields but a number closer to 3.00 per cent would negative.\" \nOn a weekly basis, the Indian rupee had strengthened by 15 paise to 68.04 against a US dollar. \n \nIn addition, the pace of FIIs' (Foreign Institutional Investors) fund inflow into equity segment will be one of the crucial determining factors for the movement of key indices. \n \nThe provisional figures from the stock exchanges showed that the FIIs purchased stocks worth Rs 1,395.73 crore while domestic institutional investors bought scrip worth Rs 1,919.03 crore. \n \nLast week, the key domestic indices zoomed by more than 3 per cent as resurgence of foreign funds and positive global cues enhanced the risk-taking appetite of investors. \n \nThe barometer 30-scrip Sensitive Index (Sensex) of the BSE augmented by 847.96 points or 3.14 per cent to 27,882.46 points. \n \nSimilarly, the wider 51-scrip Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) climbed by 291.9 points or 3.50 per cent to 8,641.25 points. \n \n(Rohit Vaid can be contacted at rohit.v@ians.in)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Equity markets news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Budgetary expectations to keep equities markets volatile","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ProKerala.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"261879685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ProKerala.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prokerala.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195310866","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Our Missouri senator, Roy Blunt, made the event happen for us.  \n   \nMost senators are allocated two guest tickets to witness the ceremony from the presidential platform on the west wing of the U.S. Capitol. As chairman of the congressional inaugural committee and emcee of the event, Blunt earned a few extra tickets to this coveted seating.  \n   \nWe showed up at 8 a.m. Jan. 20 at the Russell Senate Office Building after going through three security checks. An hour and a half later, we were marched through the passageway to the west wing of the Capitol. We were escorted through the same Capitol corridors as the president-elect and partially blinded by television lighting for the incoming elite. \n   \nAt the threshold and steps down to the outside, we saw a sea of people below stretching back to the National Mall and nearly to the Washington Monument. The crowd seemed a little rambunctious, quite understandable after the country had endured a long, divisive campaign season. We took our assigned seating about 50 yards from the presidential dais. \n   \nThen, for the next hour, the parade of dignitaries were announced one-by-one as they came to the Capitol steps. Before they walked down, bugles blared from the upper platform overlooking the main stage. \n   \nThe members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. The entire Senate. Governors from many states, including newly elected Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens. Several Trump Cabinet nominees. All received polite applause. \n   \nAfter a few moments of silence, intensity grew as the announcer presented past presidents. The 39th President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Roslyn first appeared to a strong ovation. The 42nd President Bill Clinton escorted his wife Hillary and received bigger applause. The audience showed their appreciation for the former first lady\u2019s appearance after her bitter battle with Trump. I\u2019m sure some feel she was fulfilling her duty to help reunify the country. \n   \nThen, 43rd President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura were presented. Bush gave a broad smile and embraced several onlookers as he and his wife found their seats.  \n   \nNext came the brood of President-elect Trump with all onlookers intensely curious about them. More silence and then the crowd erupted as First Lady Michelle Obama walked to her front row seat. Incoming First Lady Melania Trump next mesmerized the crowd in her gorgeous, powder blue dress. Next to last, the 44th President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden received a warm welcome as they marched together to their seats.  \n   \nFinally, you could almost feel the shift of power as President-elect Trump appeared at the Capitol threshold. He walked slowly to the front of the stage, gave a few handshakes and then paused for a warm two-handed embrace with his predecessor. A joyous roar from the masses below swelled up to our platform, as Trump waved and gave a thumbs-up. \n   \nEmcee Blunt conducted the ceremonies with precision. He gave a historical perspective to the event dating back to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s inaugural in 1801. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, spoke from a different viewpoint about the duties of president and after a few minutes got some ridicule from the audience shouting, \u201cTrump! Trump!\u201d \n   \nThe ceremony was laced with a multitude of prayers from religious icons such as Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York and the Rev. Franklin Graham of North Carolina. As it began to sprinkle rain, Graham reminded everyone the Bible teaches us rain is a blessing, implying the same with the election of Trump. We had a moment to chat with Graham afterwards about the strong support needed for Israel.  \n   \nAfter his swearing-in conducted by Chief Justice John Roberts, President Trump gave a forceful talk about returning power to the people and snubbing the Washington elite, Democrat or Republican. Depending on the pundit, observers of his speech graded it from masterful to the worst ever. But he left no doubt about his underlying philosophy.  \n   \nAs expected, afterwards, the streets of the nation\u2019s capital were filled with mostly civilized antagonism. The big exception was the arrest of more than 200 anti-Trump people in one area after vandalizing nearby buildings. Some locked arms trying to prevent people from their destinations. But most were peaceful, leaving the Trump supporters to have their joyous celebration.  \n   \nWe left the next day at the front end of the Women\u2019s March on Washington, thankful to return to the quiet confines of Missouri. To see an orderly transition of power is becoming a rare occasion in this turbulent world. We felt lucky to witness it. \n   \nDavid Bradley is chairman and CEO \n   \nof News-Press & Gazette Co. and publisher and editor of the St. Joseph News-Press.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Inaugural trip: eyewitness to history","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Buchanan","zipCode":"64501","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Saint Joseph","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"St. Joseph News-Press","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"177152785","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1044"},"name":"St. Joseph News-Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newspressnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195315713","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newspressnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/7d/97d75c69-9d59-55be-bc67-7930213db9ee/588d3c0382210.image.jpg?resize=300%2C225"}],"video":[]}}

While sales to the women's-only Friday session have been slow, Saturday \u2013 the only combined day \u2013 has sold out and the all-men's Sunday has all but done the same. \n\nShould they make it through the quarters, the Australian women will play their semi-final at Allianz just after 2pm. The final and third and fifth-place matches will also be on the main arena.\n\n\"There are scheduling challenges associated with hosting two tournaments simultaneously, which will happen for the first time at this year's Sydney Sevens,\" an ARU spokesman said. \n\n\"While it was not possible to strike a better balance this year owing to player welfare and contractual commitments, we will be discussing with all parties to see how the schedule can be enhanced next year.\"\n\nWorld Rugby made a similar pledge, citing the same contractual obligations. World Rugby controls all sevens world series tournament scheduling, but it is not clear why the ARU did not make greater efforts to request moving some men's pool matches to Kippax instead to ensure maximum exposure for their high-profile and highly-successful women's team.\n\n\"The marquee women's matches, the cup semi-finals and final, will be played on Allianz Stadium on Saturday and every effort has been made to ensure that a world-class playing surface and match environment is provided on Kippax Oval for the 10 matches that will be staged there,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The Australian women's sevens team will take centre stage when the tournament kicks off on Friday at Allianz Stadium.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Georgina Robinson"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: rugby union news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"'Better balance' promised at next year's Sydney Sevens after women's gaffe","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"6004","state":"Western Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"East Perth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"WA Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"WA Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Rugby","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.watoday.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195316182","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She plans to retire at the end of this season after a career in which she was twice runner-up in mixed doubles finals with Mexican Santiago Gonzalez at the U.S. Open in 2013 and 2014. \n \nThe triumph by Spears and the 30-year-old Cabal continued the veteran's theme of the championships with all players in the men's and women's singles finals aged 30 or older. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were playing for the men's championship Sunday night. \n \nThe 35-year-old Serena Williams coined the term \"30-fun\" after beating her 36-year-old old sister, Venus, in the oldest women's final \u2014 in terms of combined ages \u2014 in the Open era. \n \nThis was only the second Grand Slam event at a team for Spears and Cabal, who lost in the first-round at the French Open last year. \n \nCabal also celebrated his Grand Slam breakthrough, having been runner-up with Argentine Eduardo Schwank in the 2011 French Open men's doubles. \n \nHe had never advanced beyond the quarterfinals in previous mixed doubles at Melbourne Park. \n \nSpears and Cabal built on a brilliant 4-0 start to grab the opening set and continued to apply pressure with their consistency through the second. \n \nAt 4-4 Dodig double-faulted to lose his serve and Cabal stepped up to close out the victory. \n \nIt was the fifth Grand Slam event for Mirza and Dodig and their second final as a team. \n \nThey were runner-up in the French Open mixed doubles last year and Dodig won the men's doubles title with Brazil's Marcelo Melo in Paris in 2015. \n \nMirza has three mixed doubles majors, including the 2009 Australian Open and 2012 French Open with fellow Indian Mahesh Bhupathi and the 2014 U.S. Open mixed title with Brazil's Bruno Soares. She also has won three Grand Slam women's doubles titles, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2015 and last year's Australian Open with Martina Hingis.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Spears, Cabal win mixed doubles, continue 30s theme in Oz","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Newport News City","zipCode":"23601","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newport News","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hampton Roads Daily Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675891","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"967"},"name":"Hampton Roads Daily Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailypress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195330864","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It also wants to register 300 cancer survivors.  \n \nThe international event was first started 31 years ago by one man, Edel said.  \n \n\u201cHe walked around a track for 24 hours and gained attention because people were like, \u2018What is this dude doing?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAs the years went on, he started getting sponsorships and people wanted to get involved so he was like, \u2018let\u2019s make it like a relay race.\u2019 And now it\u2019s just huge.\u201d  \n \nWhile the county\u2019s event is only scheduled for six hours this year, it will function similar to a tailgate, Edel said.  \n \n\u201cAt the event, we line the tracks with tents, like a tailgate,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have on-site fundraising and each team has one person walking the track the whole night and as you go from tent to tent, you can buy goodies and food and trinkets and all that, and all the money goes back to the [American Cancer Society.] It\u2019s fun \u2013 it\u2019s just a good time.\u201d  \n \nAt the fundraiser, participants are welcomed in an opening ceremony, followed by a survivor lap, where cancer survivors and those currently affected by cancer walk the track, cheered on by attendees.  \n \nThen follows the caregiver lap, which recognizes people who have provided support for their loved once during treatment.  \n \nFinally, participants are invited to walk the track as teams or individuals.  \n \nRelay for Life events also hold a Luminaria ceremony, which remembers those who have died from cancer. It also serves to show cancer patients they are not alone.  \n \nClosing ceremonies finish the event.  \n \nFor more information or to register for Forsyth County\u2019s event, visit relay.acsevents.org/ .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Relay for Life of Forsyth County kicks off 2017 season","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"30041","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Cumming","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Forsyth County News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173710155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"52"},"name":"Forsyth County News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://forsythnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://relay.acsevents.org/site/TR/RelayForLife/RFLCY17SA?fr_id=82999&pg=entry"],"sequenceId":"695195336984","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We started with 433 homes and now we\u2019re down to 275. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to finalize this so we get homes that bring out this property \u2013 it\u2019s an incredible piece of property \u2013 and we\u2019ve put a lot of time into it.\u201d \n \n The time spent, Britt said, has resulted in more than 50 proposed conditions, including an exact number of Res-2 and Res-3 homes. \n \nThough he didn\u2019t have the plan with him Tuesday, Britt said the breakdown would be about 60/40 Res-2 and Res-3, respectively.  \n \nThose zonings are considered less intense than a MPD and would reduce the property\u2019s overall density by making lot sizes larger, while also potentially reducing the need to mass-grade the site.  \n \nLot size determines how a property is developed, said Vanessa Bernstein-Goldman, deputy director of planning and community development for the county.  \n \nBritt also said of the 50-plus conditions, at least 20 address the proposed commercial component of the property. Planning members previously raised concerns about the commercial part not being built in a timely manner on MPDs.  \n \nCurrent MPD standards require a development be 25 percent commercial, 25 percent residential and 20 percent open space.  \n \nThis, District 4 board member Bettina Hammond has previously said, is to alleviate the concern \u201cthat the residential portion will be developed without the commercial component.\u201d  \n \nThe 25 percent commercial space requirement does not guarantee stores and businesses will, in fact, move in, though; the condition only requires that builders have the space dedicated for commercial use.  \n \nBecause of Britt\u2019s Res-2 and Res-3 conditions, the Meritage property may not be required to have 25 percent commercial space.  \n \nHowever, the concern is the same: that the residential will be built out and the commercial won\u2019t come in.  \n \nTo alleviate the concern, the planning board could include additional conditions that require commercial to be secured before all the homes are built.  \n \n\u201cI have no problem saying we want 75 percent of the commercial [brought in] by [the time] 40 percent of the residential is completed,\u201d Britt said.  \n \nHe also said he told the applicant the homes need to be more upscale.  \n \n\u201cOur feedback to Meritage was we need you to step it up on the market that you\u2019re trying to address,\u201d he said.  \n \nThe application is scheduled to appear before the planning board at their Jan. 31 public hearing, where they may vote to send the application to the Board of Commissioners with a recommendation to approve or deny.  \n \nThe BOC meeting is currently set for Feb. 16.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"200-plus lot subdivision discussed near Fowler Park","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"30041","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Cumming","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Forsyth County News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173710155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"52"},"name":"Forsyth County News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://forsythnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195339488","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With a roster that is set to have at least six quarterbacks at the beginning of training camp, it will be interesting to see in what direction Napier goes.

He was drafted to play tackle, but the Seahawks stashed him at guard for his rookie season. Both Tom Cable and Pete Carroll have said recently that the plan is to leave Ifedi at guard. \n \nSadly, you can never believe what coaches say this time of year. It is entirely possible that saying that is just a draft smokescreen or leverage in a negotiation with another lineman. That means we cannot assume that Ifedi is moving or staying and must account for both outcomes. \n \nWith that in mind, here are 4 potential free agent guards that could come in an be a starter for the Seahawks: \n Ronald Leary  \nIt is impossible to watch Dallas\u2019 offensive line and not be jealous. Well, why worry about trying to develop a line like that when you can simply buy a piece of Dallas\u2019 line in free agency? \n \nThe 27 year old would be a great fit in Seattle\u2019s offense. The truth is that he\u2019d be a great fit in any offense, and that is the problem. If the Seahawks want to sign him, they\u2019re going to have to be willing to pay a premium salary. \n Kevin Zeitler  \nIf the Seahawks are looking for a starting veteran guard to drop into the middle of their line, they could do much worse than Cincinnati\u2019s Kevin Zeitler. He\u2019s only 26, and coming off a great season for the Bengals. \n \nUnfortunately, the market is likely to outpace what the Seahawks are willing to spend on an interior lineman. The Benglas payed him over $8 million last season after picking up the 5th-year option on his rookie contract. The AYP on his next deal will likely be under that, but not significant so. \n Larry Warford  \nWarford is another experienced young player. He\u2019s currently 25, though coming off what was mostly seen as a disappointing season in Detroit. \n \nThe talent is there for Warford, but he needs to show a level of consistency that hasn\u2019t been there yet in his young career. While that means there is some risk involved, it also means that he\u2019ll come with a smaller price tag than the other listed here. \n Next:  Is Cam Robinson the answer at RT for the Seahawks?  Chris Chester  \nIf Seattle wants to go the route of the old stop-gap player, Atlanta\u2019s Chris Chester would be a great fit. He\u2019s 34, but still very much a solid player. \n \nOne nice thing about Atlanta\u2019s offense is that there are enough similarities to Seattle in the run game that Chester\u2019s transition would be fairly smooth. The Seahawks would be getting the veteran leader they desperately need, plus Chester age will mean that signing him won\u2019t break the bank. \n  More from 12th Man Rising   \nThis article originally appeared on \n \nThe post appeared first on WXXV 25 .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Seattle Seahawks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Seahawks: Potential free agent targets at guard for 2017","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harrison","zipCode":"39503","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gulfport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WXXV25","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"548095138","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"33"},"name":"WXXV25","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wxxv25.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://12thmanrising.com/2017/01/27/seahawks-draft-target-cam-robinson/","http://12thmanrising.com/2017/01/28/seahawks-free-agent-guard-2017/"],"sequenceId":"695195340870","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:20:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i1.wp.com/www.wxxv25.com/wxxv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fox_Web_Graphic.jpg?fit=854%2C480"}],"video":[]}}

The Clippers defeated the Kings 121-115. Mandatory Credit: Sergio Estrada-USA TODAY Sports \n   \nGiven the latest Carmelo Anthony rumors, it\u2019s time to look at some of the potential aftermath. \n \nCarmelo Anthony to the Clippers would be the result of trading Blake Griffin to the Thunder in a three-way trade. \n \nThe NBA trade deadline is coming soon in February. \n \nUsually, there is plenty of action that goes on throughout this month. From rumors going around it seems like there will be multiple big trades during the deadline. \n \nLastly let me remind you we haven\u2019t even had the All-Star game which may benefit some players and their wishes. \n \nCarmelo Anthony has mentioned he would love to stay with New York, but if they want him gone he would be willing to opt out of his contract and sign with another team if they don\u2019t trade him. \n \nAlso, the Knicks still can trade him which seems like a great possibility since both parties want to be content.Here are three scenarios that could happen as a result of Carmelo Anthony leaving the Knicks by way of trade or opting out. \n \nHere\u2019s the result of the three-way trade that could work out. \n Next:  No. 1  \n \nJan 24, 2017; Philadelphia, PA, USA; LA Clippers forward Blake Griffin (32) dribbles the ball against the Philadelphia 76ers during the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports \n  Blake Griffin lands in Oklahoma City  \nBlake Griffin played his college ball at OU and his hometown is Oklahoma City. He would be a starter fitting in immediately. \n \nGriffin is arguably just as high flying, energetic, and powerful as Russell Westbrook. \n \nThese two along with the rest of the starters would make a contending team. \n \nThis trade could launch OKC up the standings and help give them a playoff push. \n \nThey need someone who can not only play defense, but is able to shoot consistent mid-range jump shots, and is a playmaker. \n \nThis then means roster moves would have to be made as Griffin would replace Sabonis as a starter. That means Sabonis would come off the bench leaving a couple of reserves to be traded. Continue to find out which two OKC reserves will be trade and where to\u2026 \n Next:  No. 2  \n \nJan 25, 2017; New Orleans, LA, USA; Oklahoma City Thunder guard Alex Abrines (8) blocks a shot by New Orleans Pelicans guard Tyreke Evans (1) during the second half of a game at the Smoothie King Center. The Thunder defeated the Pelicans 114-105. Mandatory Credit: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports \n  Alex Abrines and Joffrey Lauvergne head to New York  \nThese two are young rising stars who could help out the Knicks especially if Carmelo departs. New York has plenty of bigs and they need some guards who are young as well. \n \nThese two are developing players. Abrines is a young player continuously learning, who can challenge Rose and Jennings at the point guard role. \n \nLauvergne on the other hand is young, yet is talented, is quick on his feet, and hustles everywhere on the court. \n   \nWant your voice heard? Join the LA Sports Hub team! \n   \nAdditionally, he is versatile and has played for the Grizzlies and Nuggets. \n \nHe would be able to ease the departure of Anthony by starting in that position. \n \nJoffrey can shoot from downtown, create stops, and is a team player who is good at making plays for his teammates. \n \nGuillermo Hernangomez would play alongside Abrines off the bench helping keep the Knicks bench play consistent. \n \nLastly, here is a random fact many international players have played on the Knicks and have had success. \n \nThese three will have success because the organization has a foundation its built on. So how do the Knicks make room, they send one of their stars to the final team in this three team trade. \n Next:  Trade #3  \n \nOct 4, 2016; Houston, TX, USA; New York Knicks guard Derrick Rose (25) celebrates with forward Carmelo Anthony (7) after a play during the third quarter against the Houston Rockets at Toyota Center. The Rockets won 130-103. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports \n  Carmelo Anthony lands in Los Angeles  \nNew York needs room to accept these two players from the Thunder. \n \nTherefore, Anthony heads to LA since Griffin went to OKC, while Abrines and Lauvergne were dealt to the Knicks replacing Anthony. \n \nCarmelo Anthony has been open about his contract and time with the Knicks. He\u2019d prefer to stay, but if the organization wants him gone he will leave. \n \nHe does have a no- trade clause which he can opt out of and sign anywhere by the trade deadline if he is not traded. \n \nAnthony is not as high flying as he once was, but he has a high basketball IQ and savvy play-making abilities. \n \nHe will be able to help with the pace of the game LA wants to play and improve teammates around him. Also he would help improve their game and defensively he still he has it and what a better way to have a chance for a ring than head to LA. \n Next:  Closing Thoughts  \n \nOct 30, 2014; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin (32) is fouled by Oklahoma City Thunder forward Serge Ibaka (9) in the second half of the game at Staples Center. Clippers won 93-90.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2500","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wollongong","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Illawarra Mercury","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699786","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"71"},"name":"Illawarra Mercury","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.illawarramercury.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195345661","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council.

No, I\u2019m not talking GDP or job growth or unemployment. Everybody goes on about those. What the cool kids are into these days is the value of the good old U.S. dollar in international markets. \n   \nEven with that sexy buildup, I fear this sounds technical and stodgy, but give me a chance. What\u2019s going on with the dollar these days is fascinating, and as you\u2019ll see, we\u2019re not really taking a break from politics at all, as President Donald Trump is breaking with long-held dollar-policy precedence. \n   \nMost people think of the value of the dollar in purely domestic terms, as in what it can buy at the store. But in international terms, what matters is the exchange rate: how much is the dollar worth compared to other currencies. How many euro or yen or renminbi do you get for your dollar? That\u2019s the exchange rate question, and it too plays a significant role in what you can buy at the store, as the exchange rate plays a key role in the dollar price of imports, not to mention inflation. And once you invoke inflation, you\u2019ve invoked Federal Reserve policy. Most recently, the value of the dollar has even shown up in our tax policy debate. \n   \nExciting, right?! \n   \nIn conventional economics, the dollar\u2019s exchange rate is determined by a wide variety of factors. Relative growth rates, and relatedly, interest rates, between countries are important. In fact, faster U.S. growth and higher U.S. rates have been partially responsible for the 25 percent increase in the value of the dollar since mid-2014. For all Trump\u2019s talk of American \u201ccarnage,\u201d our economy is growing faster than other advanced economies, and importantly, in contrast to central banks in Europe and Japan, our Fed is raising rates. \n   \nTrade flows play a role as well, as strong demand for our exports will also push up the dollar and vice versa. The logic is simple: If the Malaysians want to buy American goods, from peanut butter to bonds, they need dollars, and that demand pushes up the dollar\u2019s value relative to the Malaysian ringgit. This might suggest that countries with trade surpluses would have stronger currencies than those with trade deficits, but here\u2019s where things get tricky, especially in the age of Trump. \n   \nIn the 2000s, China\u2019s trade surplus with us grew sharply, yet their currency failed to appreciate at all. The reason, known to all, is that China\u2019s yuan is officially pegged to the dollar. The figure below shows the dollar/yuan ratio since 2000 plotted against the dollar/euro ratio, just to show you how obvious the peg was. For both better and worse, this is the era that team Trump appears to have learned about dollar policy, and they\u2019ve not updated their priors since, despite the fact that the peg has often been relaxed since then. \n   \nModels assuming that pure market fundamentals fully determine exchange rates are thus woefully incomplete and naive. Currencies are undervalued in countries across the globe, from Japan to Germany to Korea and Singapore, and governments often play a role in keeping them that way. \n   \nWhy would they do so? Remember, when we\u2019re talking exchange rates, we\u2019re talking the value of your currency relative to mine, as in euros to dollars, and if yours is undervalued, then by definition, mine is overvalued. (An analysis by Bill Kline of the Peterson Institute recently found the dollar to be overvalued by 11 percent.) \n   \nTrump and his trade team must get partial credit for surfacing a real issue that political elites have too often ignored: When countries manipulate exchange rates, they make their exports to us cheap and ours to them more expensive. This, in turn, exacerbates our trade deficit and, in the U.S. case, accelerates the loss of factory employment. (Our trade deficit is wholly in manufactured goods; we run surpluses in services.) \n   \nAll of which brings us to this pretty remarkable thing Trump said the other day in the Wall Street Journal: \n   \n\u201cOur dollar is too strong. . . . Having a strong dollar has certain advantages, but it has a lot of disadvantages.\u201d \n   \nNow, that may sound pretty uncontroversial, and with Trump, there\u2019s always the highly germane question of whether he actually means what he says. But for decades, presidents and their treasury secretaries have refused to say anything other than, \u201cThe U.S. supports a strong dollar, full stop.\u201d They may not have always believed that to be the best policy, but their motivation in saying it was to not influence currency markets. While understandable in theory, in the real world, where countries frequently engage in currency management, that\u2019s akin to unilateral disarmament. \n   \nYet despite Trump\u2019s acknowledgment of a strong dollar\u2019s downside, his team\u2019s currency views are stuck in the period a decade ago. Whereas former administrations were too deferential to both market forces and the multinational corporations that benefit from running large trade deficits, the Trump crew assumes every currency move is evidence of manipulation. If anything, most analysts believe China\u2019s currency today is being propped up (i.e., prevented from falling). Forthcoming depreciation in the yuan, and my personal forecast is that it will fall further this year, will likely be largely a function of slower Chinese growth, capital outflows and uncertain expectations over what a China-bashing Trump administration means for their economy. \n   \nI give Trump credit for surfacing the importance of the dollar, though ironically, the dollar has climbed 3.5 percent since the election, making it tougher to reduce the trade deficit. But the policy goal should not be to somehow artificially push back against this appreciation. It should be to block countries from using their trade surpluses to buy up more dollars (and dollar-based assets) in order to gin up exchange rate movements that help them and hurt us. \n   \nThere are good ways and bad ways to push back on currency management. But my main point is this: Keep track of the dollar, as it has got a lot of important information to impart.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jared Bernstein"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Forex markets news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Currency exchange rates are  one of the most exciting economic variables to watch \u2026 really!","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anne Arundel","zipCode":"21401","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Annapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Frederick News-Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1444"},"name":"Frederick News-Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fredericknewspost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195347765","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He has moved to keep a number of the scary promises that were easier to dismiss as unfeasible during the campaign than to accept as actual policies in the real world. But the big stories he has generated have had nothing to do with these actions. \n   \nAccording to data collected by BuzzSumo.com , the most widely shared CNN news story about Donald Trump since Jan. 21 was one about his press secretary, Sean Spicer, attacking the media for their reporting on inauguration attendance. It was shared 169,700 times on Facebook. A story on Trump\u2019s executive order to start rolling back Obamacare clocked just 71,100 shares. On The New York Times\u2019 website, the most widely shared story debunked Spicer\u2019s \u201calternative facts.\u201d It showed up on Facebook 170,900 times. The New York Times piece about Trump\u2019s executive order abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership got 44,600 shares. \n   \nThis is the result of a manipulation strategy described long ago by Noam Chomsky: \u201cKeep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance.\u201d Leftists such as Chomsky argue that this is what capitalist elites do, but I know it as a common tactic of kleptocratic regimes such as Vladimir Putin\u2019s in Russia. \n   \nThere\u2019s even a term for the tactic: \u201cdiversionary conflict.\u201d Faced with economic difficulties or other problems potentially threatening to its survival, the regime starts a war somewhere or sharpens domestic ethnic divisions. Since the oil price plummeted in late 2014, the Putin regime has kept Russians on a steady diet of war news from eastern Ukraine and Syria (Russia and its allies have been winning). With the Syrian operation, Putin sharply raised his international standing, but a big reduction in protests against worsening economic conditions has probably been more important to him. \n   \nIn neighboring Ukraine, every time a government finds itself in trouble and particularly unpopular, the matter of the country\u2019s linguistic division surfaces, with various groups trying to promote or ban the Russian language. Former President Viktor Yanukovych used the language matter as cover for passing other unpopular legislation. Now, with President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s popularity at a nadir, reforms stalled and the cost of living rising sharply, Ukrainians are distracted by the discussion of a new language law that would make Ukrainian obligatory in public life, under threat of fines. \n   \nTrump doesn\u2019t need to start wars: He and his team know how emotional many Americans are about him. He can choose what he wants to be hated for -- preferably for something silly and unrelated to his actual priorities at the moment. He used this to his advantage during the campaign: His alleged sexual misconduct took up so much media time and public attention than issues like his business history, his tax returns and his proposals. \n   \nAs the inauguration attendance argument played, Trump has been busy. Apart from starting the Obamacare rollback and withdrawing from the TPP, he has frozen a reduction of mortgage insurance premiums, allowed the Keystone Pipeline to go ahead and prepared to sign an executive order to begin construction of a border wall. Well aware that some of these important actions might cause indignation and targeted protest, Trump has tossed out another meaningless football for the media and the public to fixate on. \n   \n\u201cI will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and even those registered to vote who are dead,\u201d he tweeted. Sure enough, at the time of this writing, the CNN story about this was the most shared in the last 24 hours, with news about the border wall order coming a distant second. \n   \nJust as it was unimportant how many people attended the inauguration, it doesn\u2019t matter at all at this point whether undocumented immigrants actually voted last November and whether any votes were cast for dead people. No one is challenging the results of the election. The wall and the Keystone Pipeline matter, yet are much smaller stories in terms of readership. Trump and his team are already showing a flair for diversion. Is it enough to discourage the kinds of mass protests that such aggressive moves on lightning-rod issues might spark? We\u2019ll know in the coming days and weeks, though protesters\u2019 energy was certainly sapped by the massive women\u2019s march, which took place before Trump actually did anything damaging to women\u2019s rights. \n   \nTrump\u2019s and his team\u2019s communications look awkward, inept, gallingly primitive. It\u2019s time to wise up: These people know what they\u2019re doing. They want their political opponents to be confused, to flail at windmills, to expend emotions on meaningless scandals to distract them from any targeted, coordinated action against specific threats. There are going to be many of these: Trump appears intent on keeping his promises. Calm concentration is needed to counteract dangerous policies. \n   \n- Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Leonid Bershidsky"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump a master of diversionary tactics","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anne Arundel","zipCode":"21401","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Annapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Frederick News-Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1444"},"name":"Frederick News-Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fredericknewspost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://BuzzSumo.com/"],"sequenceId":"695195347960","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That break in tradition is long overdue. \n   \nThe truth has always been that neither a strong nor a weak currency are something a government can engineer directly, at least where central banks have independent control of monetary policy and interest rates. \n   \nMoney flows to where it\u2019s welcomed and stays where it is well treated; the strength of the greenback against its peers in recent years says more about how investors view the relative vibrancy of the world\u2019s biggest economy than anything they\u2019ve heard from successive Treasury officials. \n   \n\u201cA strong dollar is in the U.S.\u2019s interests\u201d has been the Treasury\u2019s mantra ever since Robert Rubin started chanting it back in 1995. \u201cWhen we get ready to change dollar policy, I\u2019m going to rent Yankee Stadium and get a marching band so you all will know we are changing,\u201d Paul O\u2019Neill said when he held that post in 2001. \n   \nOnce out of office, however, O\u2019Neill sung a different tune. He was scathing about the idea that \u201csomehow we have the ability to manage the relationship between the value of the U.S. dollar and other currencies around the world.\u201d In 2008, he had this to say: \n   \n\u201cWhen I was Secretary of the Treasury I was not supposed to say anything but `strong dollar, strong dollar.\u2019 I argued then and would argue now that the idea of a strong dollar policy is a vacuous notion.\u201d \n   \nWhat\u2019s particularly interesting this week is the dollar\u2019s apparent lack of response to the change in Treasury mood music. Its average value against the euro last week was 1.066; its average for this week is about 1.075. As a market move, that\u2019s almost indiscernible. \n   \nEven if Mnuchin does want a weaker currency to boost exports -- Trump has also called the currency \u201ctoo strong\u201d -- that might be difficult to achieve at a time when the Federal Reserve is still suggesting it might raise interest rates three more times this year, and while both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are still engineering easier monetary policies. \n   \nDoes the shift signal a currency war is looming? Thus far, Trump hasn\u2019t made good on his threat to charge China with being a \u201ccurrency manipulator,\u201d which could lead to the U.S. imposing tariffs on Chinese imports under the Currency Undervaluation Investigation Act. \n   \nSo for now, this looks more like a border skirmish than the opening of foreign-exchange market hostilities. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine Trump deciding that one way to help achieve his 4 percent growth target would be to ramping up the rhetoric in an attempt to unwind some of the dollar\u2019s 30 percent ascent in the past five years, even if that means risking an accompanying collapse in the stock market. \n   \nMnuchin\u2019s truthfulness is yet more evidence, if any were needed, that there are no sacred cows that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration isn\u2019t willing to question.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2448","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Nambucca Heads","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nambucca Guardian News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348368704","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Nambucca Guardian News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nambuccaguardian.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195353449","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Eduardo Ano said the body of the suspected Indonesian, known by his nom de guerre Mohisen, was recovered by troops along with three slain Filipino followers of militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was seriously wounded in the hilly outskirts of Butig town in Lanao del Sur province. \n \nHapilon was wounded in the arm and was losing blood after air force warplanes, including South Korean-made FA50 fighter jets, unleashed 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs Wednesday night and Thursday on a militant encampment in an ongoing offensive, Ano said. It was the first time that the FA50s, which were acquired in late 2015 as the military's only fighter jets, were deployed in a combat mission. \n \nHapilon, who has reportedly been designated to lead an Islamic State group branch in Southeast Asia, was being moved around by his men in a makeshift stretcher but could not escape from Lanao, about 830 kilometers (520 miles) south of Manila, because artillery-backed troops have blocked possible exit points, Ano said. \n \n\"We're making it very difficult for them to move around and survive,\" Ano told The Associated Press by telephone. \n \nThe military will ask Indonesian authorities for help in confirming the identity and background of Mohisen, who was not in the list of foreign militants previously monitored as having joined Filipino militant groups in the south. \n \nHapilon, who is on the U.S. Department of Justice list of most-wanted terrorists worldwide with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture, moved to Butig from his stronghold on southern Basilan island a month ago with about 30 fighters to look for a base for his new militant alliance, Ano said. \n \nIS group commanders apparently wanted Hapilon to set up a base in Lanao, a vast region that offers more security including the presence of other Muslim insurgent groups than his mountain base on Basilan island, so foreign militants can have a springboard to expand their influence in the region, he said. \n \nThe ongoing offensive \"is significant because it will derail their plan to expand the IS presence to mainland Mindanao,\" said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, referring to the southern Philippine region, the scene of decadeslong uprisings by minority Muslims. \n \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly warned that the emergence of Islamic State-influenced militant groups is fast looming as a major national security threat. While pursuing peace talks with two large Muslim rebel groups in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation, he has ordered the military to destroy smaller but brutal extremist groups like the Abu Sayyaf, which is dreaded for cross-border kidnappings, beheadings and bombings. \n \nDuterte has asked the two Muslim rebel groups in talks with the government not to help extremists under attack by troops, warning that may bring them in a new conflict with Manila. \n \nThe elusive Hapilon, an Arabic-speaking Islamic preacher known for his expertise on commando assaults, pledged allegiance to the IS group in 2014. \n \nHe then organized an alliance called Dawlatul Islam Wilayatul Mashriq, which is now believed to include at least 10 small militant groups including some Abu Sayyaf factions and the Maute armed group, which he was meeting in Lanao when the military launched the airstrikes using the FA50s and OV-10 bomber planes. \n \nThe Maute and the Ansar Al Khilafah Philippines, another group under Hapilon's nascent alliance, have been linked to a Sept. 2 bombing of a night market that killed 15 people and wounded 69 others in southern Davao city, the president's hometown, and a failed bombing at Manila's popular Rizal Park and the U.S. Embassy last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indonesia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Southeast Asia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Philippines news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Philippine airstrikes kill suspected Indonesian militant","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Newport News City","zipCode":"23601","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newport News","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hampton Roads Daily Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675891","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"967"},"name":"Hampton Roads Daily Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailypress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195356396","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2448","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Nambucca Heads","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nambucca Guardian News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348368704","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Nambucca Guardian News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nambuccaguardian.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195362932","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Beaufort","zipCode":"29910","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bluffton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Island Packet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1303"},"name":"Island Packet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.islandpacket.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695195364801","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If the colder winter forecast holds, it would be the first rise in average natural gas prices since 2014. \n \nNatural gas prices in 2016 were the lowest they had been since 1999, after a mild winter left an excess of natural gas in storage. But those supplies began to slip after a hot summer in which electricity demand to run air conditioners was high, increasing consumption of natural gas by power generators. \n \nWith a cold start to the winter in much of the U.S. , demand is growing, storage levels are dropping and prices are rising. Last week, withdrawals of natural gas from storage in the U.S. topped five-year averages, analysts for the Energy Department found. \n \nStorage is \"where supply and demand kind of meet,\" said Tim Hess , who manages the Short-Term Energy Outlook for the U.S. Energy Information Administration . \"If there is excess in the market, it will go into storage. If there is more demand than supply, then storage levels drop.\" \n \nPart of the natural gas surplus was the result of hydraulic fracturing and drilling technologies that unlocked previously in-accessible natural gas reservoirs from shale formations. \n \nThe abundant supplies that came on the market also helped drive prices down. \n \nFor customers, plunging prices meant lower electricity bills, and lower prices drove some energy companies to switch some coal-fired power plants to natural gas. \n \nSuch changes have added to the demand for natural gas. As natural gas prices rise, electricity rates may follow. \n \nWhile January started off warmer than analysts expected, if the winter forecast holds, the country should see more withdrawals of natural gas from storage in 2017. \n \nFor the past three weeks, net withdrawals of natural gas have been more than 200 billion cubic feet, more than the five-year average of 170 billion cubic feet. Initially, the biggest withdrawals were in the South, including Texas , but the region has since returned to average withdrawal levels, Hess said. \n \nBut the future of natural gas prices -- and whether they will continue to go up -- depends on the weather. \n \n___ \n \n(c)2017 the Houston Chronicle \n \nVisit the Houston Chronicle at www.chron.com \n \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Energy Central Community"},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"Natural gas prices climbing for first time in years","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Energy Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693246","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"19"},"name":"Energy Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Energy"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.energycentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195369755","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:35:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \n\u2018The executive order is unlawful\u2019 \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n  Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Clearfield","zipCode":"16830","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Clearfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"GantDaily.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659307","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"352"},"name":"GantDaily.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gantdaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195369936","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(NYSE: SJI), today filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) requesting an increase of approximately $75 million to its base rates to recognize the infrastructure investments made to maintain the safety and reliability of its natural gas delivery system.  This filing is its first since 2013. \n \nThis case is necessary due to the significant investments South Jersey Gas made in improving its system.  They include investments in the replacement of aging mains, the installation of new mains to meet growing demand, and expenditures to ensure compliance with state and federal system integrity and safety regulations.  Since its last base rate case, the company will have invested approximately $518 million in system improvements that are not currently reflected in base rates.  \n \nWhile the company is requesting to recover these system enhancing investments through a proposed base rate increase, it is important to note that, since its last base rate case was approved in 2014, South Jersey Gas has lowered rates 14.3 percent.  An additional $30 million in Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) bill credits were provided in 2016, resulting in the average residential customer receiving credits totaling $86.  These reductions have produced average annual natural gas bills for customers at levels that are below those seen 15 years ago.  \n \n\"Investing in improvements to our infrastructure allows us to continue safely delivering a dependable supply of natural gas vital to heating customers' homes and operating their businesses.  These investments ensure we can meet customer needs while supporting southern New Jersey's growing population and economy,\" said Dave Robbins, president of South Jersey Gas. \"The improvements were also critical to supporting the goals of the New Jersey Energy Master Plan. Those goals include expanding natural gas infrastructure, using natural gas as a transportation fuel, and substituting clean-burning, more affordable natural gas for other fuels in the residential and commercial sectors,\" said Robbins. \n \n\"We understand a rate increase affects customers, especially those on fixed incomes,\" added Robbins.  \"Cost-saving measures are in place to help minimize or avoid increases, and we manage our natural gas supply portfolio responsibly to take advantage of declining wholesale natural gas prices for customers.\"  \n \nThe amount customers will pay as a result of this request will depend on the quantity of natural gas they use and the level of increase ultimately approved by the NJBPU.  Should the full amount requested be approved, a typical residential heating customer using 100 therms of natural gas in a month would pay about $20.28 more per month.  \n \nCustomers who have difficulty paying their bills should contact the South Jersey Gas Customer Care Center at 1-888-766-9900 to learn more about the Equal Payment Plan and assistance programs for which they qualify.  Assistance programs include the PAGE/TRUE programs, NJ SHARES, Home Energy Assistance Program, New Jersey Comfort Partners Program, Universal Service Fund, and Lifeline.  \n \nCustomers can also access valuable savings information on the South Jersey Gas website, including energy audits and energy efficiency tips.  These options can help reduce energy use and costs while still retaining comfort.  Visit www.southjerseygas.com to learn more. \n \nAbout South Jersey Gas \nSouth Jersey Gas, subsidiary of South Jersey Industries (NYSE:SJI), delivers safe, reliable natural gas and promotes energy efficiency to approximately 375,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Salem, and portions of Gloucester, Burlington and Camden counties in New Jersey.

This appears to have caused a change in the sex drive of 11 per cent of the sample survey. So if I were to ask you, \u201cHow is your money feeling?\u201d would you say, \u201cIt\u2019s not in the mood?\u201d \n \nI don\u2019t think you would disagree that money problems can put a real damper on the love department or on your general feelings of motivation. In fact, these problems may even lead to a general sense of apathy about life. It\u2019s as if you just can\u2019t bother because of the financial strain. \n \nAccording to personal finance expert and \u201cMoney Girl\u201d podcaster Laura Adams, there are four primary reasons that cause people to get stressed about money: \n \n1) They consistently spend more than they make, living under the threat of ever-present bill collectors. \n \n2) They spend exactly what they make, living from pay cheque to pay cheque. \n \n3) They have a huge amount of debt (eg student loans) and are finding it hard to make any progress on reducing it. \n \n4) They don\u2019t understand how to manage their finances and feel lost or overwhelmed about how to proceed. \n \nThese realities can create a sense of being stuck, confused, and unable to make a move. We are so overwhelmed by the enormity of our problems that we forget about the positives in our life. So you may already know what your financial issues are, but where are your financial strengths? Ever thought about that? \n \nPsychologists Kris Hallbom and Armand D\u2019Alo note that many people tend to focus on the negatives and delete the positives. Over time, people continue to focus their thoughts in one direction and delete everything else. We are creatures of deletion. Eventually, people forget to focus on the positive. \n \nSo you are in a dead-end job and cannot pay your bills. You forget that you are very good at baking or have a wonderful speaking voice. And so the financial stress grows and not your options, because you can\u2019t see the positives. \n \nPersonally, I think that\u2019s why corporations do much better than individuals, as the corporate structure harnesses many minds, while individuals tend to rely solely on themselves. \n \nAnd that\u2019s not really a bad thing if you are willing to do the work and reach out to a support team such as a financial coach or financial advisor who can help you to see different possibilities in your life. \n \nIt\u2019s important to consciously open yourself up to the idea of what is possible for you. In order to embrace this idea, you must first have the ability to change your daily routine by doing something different. This includes learning how to view your world through the eyes of prosperity and abundance, instead of deprivation and poverty. \n \nTry this on for a moment: \n \nThink about something that you want and all of the possibilities that exist for you to achieve it. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat is possible?\u201d \n \nRemember, thinking about what is possible rather than what is the problem requires practice and an open mind. And so you don\u2019t have to go it alone, as I stated above, and just maybe, your money will start to feel better. \n \nDennise Williams, MBA (Banking & Finance) is a journalist, TV producer, certified practitioner NLP coach and has 15 years\u2019 experience in the financial services industry.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2794","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Cowra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Canowindra News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348382822","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Canowindra News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.canowindranews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195376111","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Others use a metal shell replica. \n \nTo divine the future, Yeo says the geomancer\u2019s heart must be \u201cvery quiet\u201d. \n \n\u201cWhether or not you can communicate with the heavens is a gift,\u201d he adds. \n \nYeo says the world will be like a \u201csick ox\u201d in 2017, with an even less favourable outlook than tumultuous 2016. \n \n\u201cIt can barely even get up to eat the grass around it,\u201d he says, adding that Europe will fare particularly badly. \n \nThe rooster\u2019s metal element signifies western countries, especially Europe, and will come under pressure from the year\u2019s fire element, explains Yeo. \n \nBrexit and the refugee crisis will drive more chaos for the continent in 2017, says Chow, who uses the \u201cflying star\u201d system to make her predictions based on constellation positions. \n \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say things are calming down,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cIt will be a year of very heated arguments.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump to ruffle feathers in Year of the Rooster","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195377113","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As many investors know, uncertainty and volatility (also known as risk) are a speculator\u2019s best friends. Savvy, active investors love volatility\u2026 that\u2019s how some big bucks are made! \n \nHowever, volatility is not for everyone. This is more a game for the speculative; and the risks are usually grave (pun intended). A speculative investor has to condition himself to making losses\u2026 and so, he will risk only those funds he can afford to lose. \n \nLocally, stocks have fared well in the last two years. So much so that by the end of 2015 we were presented with the news through \n \nBloomberg that the performance of the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) had earned it the position of the No.1 stock exchange in the world! \n \nDuring 2015 the Jamaican stock market advanced by more than 90per cent \u2026 note that this was in just that one year! \n \nThat was a spectacular performance. Not even the markets in the great United States could have mustered up such a performance. Kudos to the JSE team! \n \nThe excellence continued into 2016, and even though the JSE did not quite measure up to defending its No.1 position for that year, it still returned more than 20 per cent for the year. \n \nDuring 2016 the Main JSE Index traded at a low of just over 150,000 (in the month of May) but quickly recovered to end the year at a record high of just over 190,000. \n \nSo far in 2017, the Main JSE Index has traded at a record high of 195,414 but has since given up some of its gains, trading at 195,406 as at today\u2019s date (January 16, 2017). \n \nThat said, stocks (particularly US stocks, European stocks; and sectors such as banking/finance and housing) may just be the big money-earners for 2017 as the year progresses into the Trump administration (read: lots of volatility!). \n \nIt appears that the housing sector is being plugged to do well under the new Trump administration (notwithstanding the charge he reinstated on home owners). As such, it appears that many investors are racing to get their hands on anything housing: physical real estate, stocks, REITs, bonds \u2026 the works. \n \nThe banking and finance sectors (both stocks and bonds) have been performing well over the past two years, giving investors some good returns on their investments. \n \nOil also performed well over the past year, as prices slowly recovered from below US$50 per barrel. \n \nBonds have the peculiar ability to also stave off some of the adverse effects of the political decision-making process (over time) and represent some of the most resilient investments for both individual and corporate clients. Bond markets normally settle down after periods of volatility, making them excellent medium- to long-term investments. Couple that with the regular coupons (interest) being paid by the issuers, and you get a more stable investment. Investors who require regular, steady income are more comfortable with bonds. \n \nNotwithstanding the sentiments above regarding speculative investors, the cautious investor can also make good returns on his investments. \n \nBonds provide this ability/opportunity for the cautious investor as the risks associated with bonds are much lower than those of equities (technically). An investor in bonds, who is investing for the medium- to long-term, can generally be assured of his coupons (and in many cases, a capital gain, when he decides to sell his bonds). \n \nThe bottom line is that investors should stay with the banking/financial sector; complete that with some housing bonds/stocks. Keep an eye on oil (but remember, oil is purely speculative at the moment \u2014 and extremely volatile). And as always, seek the advice of a trusted, knowledgeable financial advisor. \n \nPamela Lewis is vice-president, investments and client services at Sterling Asset Management Ltd.

Up to five million people should benefit by 2021. \n \nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo has estimated that 110 million of the country\u2019s 180 million people are extremely poor, struggling to put food on the table or pay for health care and education. \n \nNigeria\u2019s official minimum wage is 18,000 naira \u2014 not enough given the rising cost of living. \n \nThe country is suffering from double-digit inflation, and 18,000 naira is enough to buy just a 50-kilogramme (110-pound) bag of rice. \n \nBut the government hopes the extra cash will allow beneficiaries to save, buy goats, send their children to school or start small businesses. \n \n\u201cI trust Nigerians and their business-driven spirit,\u201d Maryam Uwais, a special advisor in the presidency for social issues, told \n \nAFP . \n \n\u201cIt is a start and we are keen on pushing forward the scheme. The poor have always been ignored in this country,\u201d she said. \n \nIt is estimated this \u201csocial security net\u201d will cost nearly 977 billion naira over three years. \n \nECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES \n \nThe World Bank is supervising the project and has granted a loan of US$500 million, but it still needs parliamentary approval, which is far from guaranteed. \n \nLast November, the upper chamber, the Senate, rejected a request for US$30 billion of overseas money to offset the impact of falling oil prices and economic recession. \n \nThe recession, which was officially declared last year, has largely been caused by a slump in oil revenue, on which Nigeria depends. \n \nInflation has soared to nearly 20 per cent, especially for consumer products such as palm oil and rice, as well as for transport. Foreign currency is in short supply. \n \n\u201c(The) government is well aware of the issues of funding but hopefully we will meet the target this year,\u201d said Osinbajo\u2019s spokesman, Laolu Akande. \n \nOther welfare projects include youth training schemes, food distribution programmes in primary schools, and micro-credit initiatives for women \u2014 a first in a country with a free-market tradition. \n \nBut unlike elsewhere in Africa, such as in South Africa or Kenya, help is not necessarily provided to older people or the disabled. \n \nTo reduce the risk of fraud, the beneficiaries are appointed by community groups, and the funds are transferred directly by the federal government into individual accounts. \n \nA DROP IN THE OCEAN \n \nIn Bauchi State, one of the first three states to benefit from the programme, a committee has been set up to register some 10,800 people and root out fraudulent requests, said Mansur Manu Soto, a local councillor for development. \n \nFor Nonso Obikili, a Nigerian economist with the Economic Research Southern Africa programme in South Africa, the initiative was promising but addressed just \u201ca drop in the ocean of poverty in Nigeria\u201d. \n \n\u201cIt seems to be an organised system, well monitored and much better on the corruption side,\u201d Obikili said. \n \n\u201cBut these cash welfare systems are very easy to get out of control, and when government wants or needs to stop, this leads to crisis. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing but it only works when the economy is growing,\u201d he added. \n \nThe World Bank is encouraging similar projects in about 30 African countries. \n \n\u201cThese type of programmes have been demonstrated through rigorous impact evaluations and shown to increase consumption and protect the poorest against economic shocks,\u201d said the bank\u2019s communication officer in Abuja, Olufunke Olufon. \n \nA similar scheme has been rolled out in Ivory Coast, where 58 per cent of the population lives in poverty despite economic growth that hit 7.8 per cent last year. \n \nStarting this month, 5,000 poor rural households will receive 36,000 CFA francs (US$59) every quarter until 2020. The government expects 35,000 households will eventually benefit. \n \nIn Senegal, nearly 300,000 homes \u2014 or about two per cent of the population \u2014 will be given state aid of up to 25,000 CFA francs each quarter, according to the government.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Nigeria casts its first social safety net","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195378106","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It would also allow the Department of Motor Vehicles to adopt regulations, while also permitting driverless vehicles to be used by taxicab companies and ride-sharing services that are licensed by state regulators.\n\n\u201cOur definitions haven\u2019t kept up with the definitions the industry is using,\u201d Hill said, adding that the vehicles must be certified, insured and proven safe. \u201cWe need to refresh that law.\u201d\n\nFor example, state law currently refers to the operator of a vehicle as a \u201cdriver,\u201d but that definition doesn\u2019t work for piloting an autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe bill would expand that interpretation, allowing a driver to be characterized as a human or a computer.\n\nStaying on the cutting edge, Hill said, means not limiting potential business opportunities for the state.\n\nOver the short term, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles and other regulating agencies would be charged with adopting rules. A DMV spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn the long term, the bill will have lasting impacts on Nevada\u2019s road infrastructure. Over time, wireless sensors will be embedded in streets and highways that would allow traffic signals and vehicles to \u201ctalk\u201d to one another.\n\nAs for reaction, backlash is almost a sure thing from taxi drivers, Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison said during a Governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development board meeting held earlier this month.\n\nBut taxicab operators have reason to keep an eye on this emerging technology as a way to benefit their industry, said Tina Quigley, general manager of the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. While there may be reason for concern, Quigley said that drivers-for-hire shouldn\u2019t be scared of losing their jobs just yet. It will probably take about 20 to 30 years before fleets of autonomous vehicles take over Nevada\u2019s roads, she said.\n\n\u201cThis change isn\u2019t going to happen overnight,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cThis is going to be a very slow and methodical adoption.\u201d\n\nStan Olsen, chairman of the Nevada Taxicab Authority, which regulates Southern Nevada\u2019s taxi industry, could not be reached for comment.\n\nRepresentatives with the Livery Operators Association, which represents some of the local taxi companies, could not be reached for comment, either.\n\nAn Uber spokeswoman declined to comment for this story, but a spokeswoman for Lyft said that company executives are reviewing the bill.\n\nLast year, Lyft announced a partnership with General Motors to launch an on-demand network of autonomous vehicles, with the anticipation that driverless fleets will account of a majority of the ride-sharing company\u2019s business within five years.\n\nHill said he is expecting the bill\u2019s language to change as the affected companies and employees provide input during the legislative session, set to begin on Feb. 6.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going into this process with an open mind,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe want to get input from people, and that\u2019s why we got this bill out relatively early.\u201d\n\nContact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

Turns out that in two of our most productive crops, these shaded leaves are less efficient than the top leaves, limiting yield. \n \nThese findings, published in the Journal of Experimental Botany, could help scientists further boost the yields of corn and Miscanthus, as well as other C4 crops that have evolved to photosynthesize more efficiently than C3 plants such as wheat and rice. \n \n\"The wild ancestors of C4 crops are thought to have grown as individuals in open habitats where the number of leaves that they produced would have been limited by water and nitrogen and most leaves would be exposed to full sunlight\" said principal investigator Steve Long, Gutgsell Endowed Professor of Plant Biology and Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois. \n \n\"Today we grow these crops in ever denser stands, and provide them with nitrogen and water so that they can produce many more layers of leaves. But as a result, the proportion of leaves that are shaded has increased, and the production of grain will depend more and more on the contribution of this increasing proportion of shaded leaves. So how do the Maseratis of photosynthesis, C4 crops, do when they are on a meager meager fuel ration in the shade?\" \n \nNot well, according to this paper: when top and bottom leaves are placed in the same low light, the lower canopy leaves showed lower rates of photosynthesis. Shaded corn leaves are 15 percent less efficient than top leaves - and worse, lower leaves are 30 percent less efficient than the top leaves of Miscanthus, a perennial bioenergy crop that is 60 percent more productive than corn in Illinois. \n \nConsidering the crop as a whole, this loss of efficiency in lower leaves may costs farmers about 10 percent of potential yield - a cost that will increase as planting density increases. This 'Achilles' heel' likely applies to other C4 relatives, such as sugarcane and sorghum. \n \n\"What's interesting is that we saw this loss in efficiency in the lower canopy was not due to the leaf senescing and dying off - we would have expected that,\" said first author Charles Pignon, a doctoral candidate in the crop sciences and at the Carl R. \n \nWoese Institute for Genomic Biology. \"The leaves were still perfectly healthy when we were looking at them; they were even darker. In the article, we show through experiments that this was not caused by age.\" \n \n\"Next, it will be important to find out why this loss in efficiency occurs and if there's any way that we can fix it, since overcoming this and gaining a 10 percent increase in production would be very significant,\" Pignon said. \n \nThe paper \"Loss of photosynthetic efficiency in the shade. An Achilles heel for the dense modern stands of our most productive C4 crops\" was published in Journal of Experimental Botany .

In 2017, it\u2019s virtual reality. \n \nOver the past few days, VR has dropped me in the middle of 1862\u2019s Battle of Antietam and in the living room of a gay man as he\u2019s being disowned by his family. At Sundance, you can even become a tree if you\u2019re so inclined. \n \n\u201cVR in this past year has really accelerated,\u201d says Miles Perkins, vice president of marketing communications for Jaunt VR. \u201cIt was a little bit of a niche thing in years past. \u2026 It\u2019s turned into a real industry. And this year is probably larger than I\u2019ve ever seen it with VR filmmakers \u2014 filmmakers who are dedicated and specifically doing things just in VR.\u201d \n \nJaunt debuted \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d an offshoot of the PBS series \u201cMercy Street,\u201d which follows two brothers fighting on opposite sides of the Civil War. More than 150 Civil War re-enactors were used to film \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d and several of them crawl right up in your face as they die. You can practically feel the intensity of the battle. \n \nJaunt also premiered \u201cBashir\u2019s Dream,\u201d a mix of live action documentary filmmaking and animation that tells the story of Qusai Bashir Masaama, a 14-year-old Syrian refugee living in Jordan, who was shot in the back by a sniper while he was on his way to buy candy. \n \nOther virtual reality standouts at Sundance include the Synesthesia Suit, a full-body exoskeleton-style suit with 26 sensors to provide as much sensation as possible while playing the video game \u201cRez Infinite\u201d or experiencing the psychedelic sounds of \u201cCrystal Vibes.\u201d \n \nIn August 2014, Daniel Ashley Pierce recorded the audio of the verbal and physical abuse heaped on him by his conservative parents as they were kicking him out of the house because of his homosexuality. That audio is the soundtrack to \u201cOut of Exile: Daniel\u2019s Story,\u201d which lets participants experience Daniel\u2019s hurt and pain in 360 degrees. \n \nAnd a three-hour wait accompanied \u201cTree,\u201d a haptically enhanced virtual experience by artists Milica Zec and Winslow Porter that follows the life cycle of a rainforest tree. \n \n\u201cYou start as a seed, you burst through the ground, and then all of a sudden when you start getting branches, you realize that your arms are branches,\u201d Zec says. \u201cYou can move them, and your body\u2019s a trunk.

Now researchers report in the journal ACS Nano a simple way to make a benign, more efficient fertilizer that could contribute to a second food revolution. \n \nFarmers often use urea, a rich source of nitrogen, as fertilizer. Its flaw, however, is that it breaks down quickly in wet soil and forms ammonia. The ammonia is washed away, creating a major environmental issue as it leads to eutrophication of water ways and ultimately enters the atmosphere as nitrogen dioxide, the main greenhouse gas associated with agriculture. \n \nThis fast decomposition also limits the amount of nitrogen that can get absorbed by crop roots and requires farmers to apply more fertilizer to boost production. \n \nHowever, in low-income regions where populations continue to grow and the food supply is unstable, the cost of fertilizer can hinder additional applications and cripple crop yields. Nilwala Kottegoda, Veranja Karunaratne, Gehan Amaratunga and colleagues wanted to find a way to slow the breakdown of urea and make one application of fertilizer last longer. \n \nTo do this, the researchers developed a simple and scalable method for coating hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles with urea molecules. HA is a mineral found in human and animal tissues and is considered to be environmentally friendly. In water, the hybridization of the HA nanoparticles and urea slowly released nitrogen, 12 times slower than urea by itself. \n \nInitial field tests on rice farms showed that the HA-urea nanohybrid lowered the need for fertilizer by one-half. The researchers say their development could help contribute to a new green revolution to help feed the world's continuously growing population and also improve the environmental sustainability of agriculture. \n \nResearch paper","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Chemicals industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Nanoparticle fertilizer could contribute to new 'green revolution'","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Seed Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"598035098","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Seed Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.seeddaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.6b07781"],"sequenceId":"695195385275","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them walking up and down the Strip smoking. Let\u2019s give them some place to go.\u201d\n\nSegerblom intends to introduce a bill this session, which begins Feb. 6, that would give governments at the city and county levels the authority to issue public marijuana-use permits for just about every possibility. Big events like the Electric Daisy Carnival, bars, hookah lounges or even designated pot-friendly streets or sidewalks would all be fair game if Segerblom\u2019s bill were to pass.\n\nBut some in local government worry pushing for public usage a few months after legalizing recreational marijuana is simply too much, too soon.\n\n\u201cHaving it in a public square when we just passed it, I have very serious reservations,\u201d said Clark County Commissioner Mary Beth Scow.\n\nScow, who did not support the legal pot ballot measure, said she\u2019d prefer to wait and see how social marijuana experiments go in other states before rushing into it in Southern Nevada.\n\nIn November, Denver voters approved a measure similar to Segerblom\u2019s bill. That measure creates a four-year pilot program that allows most types of businesses, including cafes and yoga studios, to apply for a public-use license. It is expected to go into effect sometime this summer.\n\nColorado and Washington, which both legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, have set precedents for Nevada and other states as medical and recreational marijuana regulations are crafted.\n\n\u201cWhere these other areas are collecting data and seeing how things go, it would be wise for us to watch what happens in other states,\u201d Scow said.\n\nScow\u2019s not alone in thinking Segerblom\u2019s proposal is going too fast.\n\nClark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak said he\u2019s worried that there are talks of adding new folds to the industry before the state has crafted the regulations that will guide and govern the recreational market. The Department of Taxation is drawing up the rules for the recreational marijuana market, but those aren\u2019t expected to be finished until later this year.\n\nThere are also other issues relating to marijuana that the county wants to address, like the odor from cultivation facilities, Sisolak said. And he\u2019d like to have more time to figure those out before jumping into discussions about public use, he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a good idea in some point in time, but I don\u2019t know when that point in time is,\u201d Sisolak said.\n\nSegerblom said he understands some lawmakers could be hesitant to let people start smoking in public settings, but he noted that the bill would put all the power into those lawmakers\u2019 hands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to them.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2324","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Raymond Terrace","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Port Stephens Examiner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694033","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Port Stephens Examiner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195386075","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:29:42Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/ee974bdb-c7e3-4991-93f1-8b638bee948c.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Study Group, which ran from 16-18 January 2017, was organised by the IMI and the Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN), and sponsored by Innovate UK. \n \nConfectionary company Mondelez International, famous for brands such as Cadbury and Toblerone, asked delegates to come up with a technique to determine the minimum and maximum likely cocoa yields driven by climate variability of a particular region or country. \n \nCocoa yields can vary hugely from year to year depending on climate conditions, meaning there is a large fluctuation in income for farmers, making investment in cocoa farming less attractive. \n \nBeing able to model the potential variation in yields would enable Mondelez to offer targeted advice to smallholder farmers on how to improve their yields, and help secure the development of sustainable farming communities. \n \nDr Eamon Haughy, Statistician and Data Analyst, Mondelez International, said: \"This workshop was a fantastic opportunity to engage with a diverse group of applied mathematicians. Participants got really involved with the problem presented and generated innovative ideas on how to deal with the effects of climate on cocoa yield variation. This work has the potential to make a real difference to the lives of cocoa farmers.\" \n \nModelling the \"Full value pig\" \nAgricultural software developers Innovent Technology posed the challenge of developing a model for the \"full value pig\", the theoretical maximum value of a pig based on the weight of the animal and quality of its meat. \n \nAbattoirs pay farmers for meat depending on the dead weight and fat content of each animal, penalising farmers for animals that are too large, small or fat. Each abattoir has its own set of target values depending on where in the world the meat is to be sold. \n \nInnovent therefore would like to develop a mathematical model that would allow a producer to identify which pigs would attain the best return on investment based on the abattoir contracts available, and to provide tailored information on how best to optimise their farming practises to achieve the \"full value pig\". \n \n\"Taking part in the study group was a really positive experience. I found it a fun, fascinating process and it certainly has opened my eyes to the opportunities offered by applied mathematics to agriculture. Thanks to everyone for their hard work; hopefully we can find a way to continue this interaction in the near future,\" said Willie Thomson, Director, Innovent Technologies. \n \nOptimising hydroponic technology \nWith the world's population growing rapidly, humans need to produce as much food in the next 50 years as has been grown in the last 10,000 years. \n \nA way of meeting this colossal increase in demand for food is by growing more crops using hydroponic methods, where plants grow in nutrient rich water instead of soil. Hydroponics increase crop yields and reduces the amount of space needed in food production, however the current systems are bulky, costly, and difficult to scale up. \n \nPhytoponics Ltd is developing a new system, called the HydrosacTM, which is a flexible polythene grow bag that has inflated sides to keep it rigid. The inventors anticipate their system will reduce the costs of hydroponics and make the technology easy to scale up. \n \nParticipants at the Study Group were tasked with optimising the dimensions and geometry of the HydrosacTM grow bag to improve the weight-carrying capacity so that heavier crops may be grown without the need for twine support, whilst maximising the growing surface of the platform, which will reduce costs. \n \nAdam Dixon, CEO, Phytoponics, said: \"The mathematicians immediately gained a full appreciation of our problem; it was a real pleasure seeing their minds at work. After the Agri-Food Study Group we really feel we have a thorough understanding of the equations describing our product and are incorporating them into our design.\" \n \nBuilding new industrial partnerships \nManager of the IMI, Dr Joanna Jordan, said: \"Study Groups are an ideal catalyst for bringing together universities and companies in mutually-beneficial collaborations. They provide an easy way for industry to gain access to UK excellence in the fields of mathematics, statistics, engineering and computer science. \n \n\"It's been a pleasure to work with the KTN in hosting the Study Group in Bath this week to enable the exploration of innovative approaches to real problems within the Agri-Food sector. We anticipate the collaborations we've initiated will lead to many fruitful partnerships. We'd be delighted to hear from companies interested in participating in similar events in the future.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Agriculture news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Pigs and chocolate: Using math to solve problems in farming","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Seed Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"598035098","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Seed Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.seeddaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195387393","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The investment banker turned venture capitalist started Fortress Investment Group in 1998 \u2014 a firm which executes a range of investment strategies for more than 160 institutional investors and private clients around the world in private equity, credit, liquid markets and traditional asset management. \n \nEdens proudly notes that the firm started with a little more than US$400 million and 30 employees and now manages about US$72 billion worth of assets and 1200 employees. \n \nHighly respected in his field with a reputation as shrewd but fair, Edens is often talked about in terms of his track record for building, improving and expanding on the businesses he buys, invests in and manages. His broad reach across sport, infrastructural development and economic growth has sometimes garnered Orwellian criticism \u2014 with an investigative \n \nNew York Times report last summer commenting on [questioning?] the company\u2019s impact on legislation, the consumer and daily life. \n \nSpeaking with Edens, his manner is open and friendly. There is no sense of guarded responses being given and nary an inkling of a corporate overlord weaving a tangled web. \n \nEdens\u2019 tale of good old hard work done good is refreshingly honest and inspiring. He started in New York as an investment banker, starting the securities trading desk at Lehman Brothers on the securities trading desk as most essential to shaping his future, eventually rising in the ranks to managing director and partner at before the close. \n \n\u201cI left Lehman Brothers and went to Black Rock. It was a small money management company at the time. That\u2019s where I raised the first fund. We did well and those guys are still friends. After that I decided the next logical step would be to set up my own company.\u201d \n \nEdens is candid about what led to the Jamaica Liquefied Natural Gas project, and here sentiment or a love of reggae or culture plays no part. \n \n\u201cTwo things we look for as investment attributes in the country: legal framework and regulatory framework.. We think that all the attributes for success exist in Jamaica. \n \nWe also look to make sure that we can deliver something of value to the country, [in this case] convert the energy business from burning heavy fuels to natural gas.\u201d \n \nEdens discloses that the arrangement between Fortress Investment Group subsidiary New Fortress Energy to supply local energy company the Jamaica Public Service with LNG goes beyond converting the plant \u2014 the island\u2019s first\u2014 in Bogue, as the intent is to totally lessen the island\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels, hinting at a blueprint for the wider Caribbean. \n \n\u201cSubsequent to the gas terminal we are going to pursue two other projects on the other side of the island in Old Harbour. We will also provide fuel for the Old Harbour power plant with JPS, as well as another initiative not yet publicly available. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s what we like to do, get into the country, make an initial investment and if successful branch out and do other things. In Jamaica there are many different opportunities...\u201d \n \nThe New Fortress Energy 20-year supply deal has so far seen the completion of the plant in Bogue, a US$750-million investment shouldered solely by New Fortress Energy with the first shipment of gas arriving in October 2016. \n \nAs preparations are being made for building the next plant in Old Harbour, at a cost also borne by Fortress, local legislators and JPS President and CEO Kelly Tomblin have hailed the timely progress as essential to local development and positioning Jamaica as a central hub for processing and trading LNG within the Caribbean region. \n \nTomblin has been quotedas saying, \u201cThe country has been trying to achieve fuel diversity for a long time, and 2016 represents the year that it has really happened, with the introduction of gas, grid-scale solar, and the addition of significant wind capacity to the grid. Natural gas will play a key role in transforming the energy sector,while supporting industrial development and economic growth.\u201d \n \nFor Fortress, Edens notes doing business in Jamaica has not proved as challenging as naysayers may believe, \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a different experience for us in a positive sort of way. We have had businesses that operate in Africa the Middle East and other Third World economies. That\u2019s much different than in Jamaica. If you look at proximity to the United States, you share the same attributes that we do, such as significant energy challenges. If you get on a plane to Miami and fly to Jamaica it doesn\u2019t take you very long \u2014 what strikes you is the cost and reliability of electricity is very different in Jamaica than in Miami, [that\u2019s the problem we want to] solve in terms of availability and reliability.\u201d \n \nEdens also points out that contrary to popular belief, the skill set needed was readily available in Jamaica, and overall he finds economic growth as the primary hindrance to the island\u2019s development. \n \n\u201cThere is a highly educated workforce, and whats lacking in certain circumstances is ease of economic growth. Just think of the range of businesses that can take advantage of the workforce.We\u2019ve been very pleased with the quality of people we\u2019ve been interacting with in Jamaica, the JPS people we work closely with in Montego Bay have been phenomenal and management as well.\u201d \n \nEdens\u2019 foray into the Jamaican energy sector was not his first visit to the island, as he confesses he is a sports fan, with particular admiration for two of our island greats Lennox Lewis and Usain Bolt, and points out that local jerk is a must-have. \n \n\u201cThe food\u2019s great here. I love spicy food and I\u2019m a big track and field and sports fan. I\u2019ve been down here once or twice on vacation before. I had not been to Kingston before though I had been to Montego Bay \u2014 so this has been a new experience. I like Kingston, it\u2019s an easy place for us to get in and out of. \n \nMost of my trips are fairly short, a day or two, and I keep busy with the people I\u2019ve dealt with on the project. A lot of people I really respect. Overall it\u2019s been an incredibly supportive process. I think people are very focused on what the outcomes would be.\u201d \n \nHopefully Edens will get some more time to explore as the project progresses as the Montana native express a fondness for the outdoors, \n \n\u201cI grew up a long ways from Jamaica, in Montana on a ranch. I spent the vast majority of my time outdoors, and it shows in a lot of the activities I pursue now as an adult. I used to ride horses competitively, show jumping, mountain climbing. For me as a kid it was the mountains not the oceans.\u201d \n \nFortress\u2019 projects are wide-ranging and span the globe, yet Edens has taken almost 30 trips to the island so far, keeping his eye and a personal touch on this particular project. \n \n\u201cThe investment in Jamaica is an important one for me, I think this can be a great model, and it\u2019s still sort of like our first date. There\u2019s only one first. JPS and the Government are very personally invested. And I think it will help to act as a real model in the Caribbean and around the world. By personality I am a builder. I have a real passion for hands on projects. For example, take the Milwaukee Bucks \u2014 an NBA basketball team we bought a few years ago \u2014 we\u2019re building a new arena as part of that. In Florida we\u2019re building a passenger train from Miami to Orlando. There are a handful of notable and personally invested projects that I do give a bit more energy to.\u201d \n \nEdens also notes this dedication isn\u2019t limited to an attraction to the scope and scale of investments; he takes his role as being able to deliver equally as important. \n \n\u201cI like people who get stuff done. Financially, investing is interesting as well but I am definitely attracted to people who have taken an idea and turned it into something tangible or just go do something. It\u2019s easy to criticise other people\u2019s activities and ideas and say it can\u2019t be done. The power plant in Bogue was built and designed in 2003. \n \n\u201cThere are not many things that are not possible \u2014 even if it seems ambitious, take a plan and make it happen.\u201d \n \nLike many successful people, Edens admires the tenacity of other successful investors, perhaps unwittingly indicating the footprint he himself hopes to leave. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people I admire: Warren Buffett, whom I\u2019ve met a number of times, and he has a great track record as one of the great financial investors. Elon Musk with Tesla \u2014 again it\u2019s very easy for people to criticise what has happened and say it won\u2019t work, but he put his own money in and didn\u2019t take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.\u201d \n \nWes Edens spoke at The Destination Experience seminar in Kingston which ended yesterday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"South Florida news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Caribbean news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Fortress Investment Group energetic over multiple investments in Jamaica \u2014 Wes Edens","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195387700","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I signed up to try and help him.\u201d\n\nDozier first waived his appeals on Oct. 31, when he sent a letter to District Judge Jennifer Togliatti asking that he be put to death.\n\nHe was sentenced to die in December 2007 after a four-week trial for the murder and mutilation of an Arizona man in a Strip hotel.\n\nA Clark County jury convicted him of killing 22-year-old Jeremiah Miller at the now-closed La Concha Motel and robbing him of $12,000 that Miller had brought from Phoenix to Las Vegas to purchase materials to make methamphetamine.\n\nMiller\u2019s torso, cut into two pieces, was found in April 2002 in a suitcase in a trash bin at an apartment complex. His head, lower arms and lower legs never were recovered.\n\nIn 2005, Dozier was convicted in Arizona of second-degree murder and given a 22-year prison sentence. In that case, prosecutors said he shot and killed a 27-year-old man, stuffed his body into a plastic container and dumped it in the desert near Phoenix.\n\n\u2018MY GOAL IS TO BE EXECUTED\u2019 \n\nStanding before Togliatti and flanked by three corrections officers and his attorney at a recent court appearance, Dozier made his desires clear and raised questions about what would happen should Nevada legislators decide to abolish the death penalty.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to be executed, first and foremost,\u201d said a shackled Dozier, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, black rectangular glasses and white Nikes. \u201cBut if I\u2019m not, and I\u2019m going to be to stuck alive, I would like to know what my options are.\u201d\n\nNevada\u2019s last execution, by lethal injection, occurred at the Nevada State Prison in April 2006.\n\nThe state has executed 12 inmates since capital punishment was reinstated by the Legislature in 1977. All but one were inmates who, like Dozier, voluntarily gave up their appeals. Last year, prison officials sent out 247 requests for proposals after a stockpile of at least one drug used in executions expired, and not one response was received.\n\nOther states have cut back on executions, as only 20 people were executed across the nation in 2016, the fewest in 25 years. On Thursday, a federal judge in Ohio found that state\u2019s lethal injection process unconstitutional.\n\nLegislators in Nevada are weighing a bill that would make life without the possibility of parole the maximum criminal penalty.\n\nDozier has asked to have another attorney explain the legal process to him should his death wish be stopped by state law. The judge may have trouble finding someone who sees eye to eye with him.\n\n\u201cI have an inherent distrust of most people that are doing death penalty work, because I believe they are either politically or personally anti-death penalty,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cAnd as such, I don\u2019t know that they actually can give me an objective assessment and not skew it towards trying to convince me otherwise. Even if they could give me an objective one, I might be a little dubious about it.\u201d\n\nTogliatti said she likely would order an evaluation of Dozier\u2019s competency.\n\n\u201cIf he really wants to be executed, and talking to a doctor will help him achieve that goal, my guess is he\u2019s going to cooperate and talk to a doctor,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is absolutely correct,\u201d he said.\n\nRecordings of 47 of Dozier\u2019s recent death row phone calls were made public this month through court exhibits. The conversations offer a window into his intelligence, competence and views on the world he knows from his cell.\n\nHe tells friends and family he is tired of life; he envisions his path to the execution chamber; he expresses grief over the death of his grandmother; he boasts of his muscular physique, chiseled by boredom-induced prison exercise; and he offers relationship advice.\n\n\u2018NOTHING TO CRY OVER\u2019 \n\nLate last year, Dozier called another friend to let her know that he had requested that his appeals cease, and he explained that he soon would be headed to court seeking an execution date.\n\n\u201cOh, my God,\u201d his friend said. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\nShe asked if others knew of his decision.\n\n\u201cNo one thinks it\u2019s a stellar idea, but they all understand, you know,\u201d he told her. \u201cThis has been a long time coming, and I finally just got fed up with it.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to know why.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m (expletive) so over this scene, and I am, yeah, actually I\u2019m kind of stressed because \u2026 the chemicals to do it have expired,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s going to be some issues, but hopefully they\u2019ll get it done and not decide to abolish it and leave me (expletive) hung out.\u201d\n\nShe became emotional.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing to cry over, I promise,\u201d he said, then laughed.\n\nDozier also called his sister to talk about the legal steps he anticipated before the judge could sign his death warrant.\n\nHe said he had spoken with an American Civil Liberties Union attorney about capital punishment and his own life\u2019s worth, a theme echoed in other phone calls.\n\n\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s some fundamental differences in our philosophies of life,\u201d he said he told the lawyer. \u201cAnd I think I recognize this causes you cognitive dissonance because it\u2019s just never going to make sense. But I think you find life has a deeper inherent value than I believe, especially in mine.\u201d\n\nContact David Ferrara at dferrara@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-1039.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Abel allegedly committed a string of pharmacy robberies in five counties across two states. The case before Magisterial District Judge Jennifer Jeffries, Wednesday, was for a robbery allegedly committed at Nickman\u2019s Pharmacy in Hopwood, Jan. 25, 2016. He is jailed in Greenwood, West Virginia in lieu of bonds set in multiple cases. A charge of homicide by vehicle was added against Natasha M. Amatuccio before her preliminary hearing Monday after a car crash victim died. Amatuccio waived her charges to the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas. She was allegedly found with heroin when she crashed head on into a vehicle driven by Rita Packan on Route 40 in Menallen Township Jan. 19, 2016. Packan told police she was driving her mother, Theresa Charnovich, 88, of New Salem to the doctor when the crash occurred. Charnovich spent more than four months in hospitals following the crash and died June 9. Aggravated assault and other charges filed against Alexis Amber Armel, 29, of Uniontown were dismissed. Zachary Shumar initially told police he and Armel got into an argument and she cut him between his thumb and forefinger with a kitchen knife. Leanna Sue Fisch, 24, waived her charge of aggravated harassment by prisoner Tuesday for allegedly throwing a blood-soaked feminine product at a prison guard in the segregated housing unit of Fayette County Prison Jan. 9. Nathan L. Smyth, 22, of Connellsville waived aggravated assault and related charges Wednesday for his alleged involvement in the beating of Bernard Geisel Jr. of Farmington, June 24. His bond was reduced from $50,000 to $20,000.

Registration for the classes is $50.\n\nHalliday said the classes will utilize the E6B flight computer used to calculate time, distance and fuel consumption on one side and wind drift correction and ground speed on the other.\n\nInstructors other than Halliday include John Peters, a commercial pilot with a flight instructor rating, and John Armel, a certified ground and instrument instructor. All three are from Greene County.\n\nAfter taking the series of classes, participants will be able to get authorization to take the written Private Pilot Test. Those that pass will have two years to complete their private pilot rating.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Brogan said in his prepared remarks delivered in an annual State of the System address Thursday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not just philosophical, it\u2019s mathematical,\u201d Brogan said at PASSHE\u2019s Board of Governors meeting. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to get worse if we don\u2019t do something about it.\u201d\n\nBrogan noted the reorganization of public university systems in other states, including the merger or closure of institutions.\n\n\u201cIs that where we are headed?\u201d Brogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer today, nor can anyone else.\u201d\n\nCalifornia University of Pennsylvania is a charter member of the State System, becoming a part of the system in 1983.\n\nState System spokesperson Kenn Marshall told the Herald-Standard that the system hopes to have its organizational review completed by the end of 2017, adding that the system currently has a request for proposal soliciting consultants to work on the review.\n\n\u201cThat consideration can\u2019t be off the table going into this review,\u201d Marshall said of merging or closing one or several state universities.\n\nMarshall stressed that the review will be comprehensive, focused on \u201cfinding solutions\u201d by reviewing payroll and other procedures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at the way we do everything,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nMarshall added that the State System must plan to attract more nontraditional students with new educational programs catering to part-time and adult students, as well as making it easier for community college students to transfer to state universities for their third and fourth collegiate years to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\n\u201cThese are the kinds of things we need to do,\u201d Marshall said, adding that declining Pennsylvania high school graduation rates have also hurt state universities.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s public high school four-year adjusted graduation rate increased from 83 in 2010-11 to 84.8 in 2014-15, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nMarshall said that the State System\u2019s funding appropriation is still $60 million less than it was prior to the 2008 recession despite funding increases from the Legislature in the past two years. He also cited competition from the state\u2019s 300-plus postsecondary schools as another factor in declining state university enrollment, specifically noting Penn State\u2019s 24 campuses and the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s five campuses throughout Pennsylvania.\n\nCal U\u2019s enrollment has declined sharply since peaking at 9,483 in fall 2011, according to State System data. Its enrollment has dropped 20.35 percent from fall 2011 through fall 2016, the sixth-largest decline among the 14 state universities in that span. Only two state universities, West Chester and Slippery Rock, have seen their enrollments increase over the same span.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reality of the real world,\u201d Chair of Cal U Council of Trustees and Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi said of Brogan\u2019s announced consideration of merging or closing state universities. \u201cThe fit survive.\u201d\n\nA 1979 Cal U graduate, Maggi said the university is Washington County\u2019s third-largest employer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to us,\u201d Maggi said.\n\nBut Maggi observed that high school students in southwestern Pennsylvania are entering lucrative industries such as HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) and trucking that don\u2019t require a four-year degree.\n\nOn the same morning of Brogan\u2019s State of the System address, Maggi was at Penn Commercial in Washington as the school announced a partnership with Lennox and unveiled plans for its new HVAC lab.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a demand for that,\u201d Maggi said, adding that higher education has not adapted to the local demand among gas companies and other employers for workers with particular skills.\n\nMaggi indicated that Cal U\u2019s Council of Trustees had discussed strategies to attract more students on a limited basis in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of everything,\u201d Maggi said of discouraging factors like lagging state funding, greater postsecondary school competition and the issue of student debt. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the perfect storm of things going on.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mike Tony mtony@heraldstandard.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"PASSHE review to consider options including school closings and mergers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Greene","zipCode":"15370","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Waynesburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald-Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"454406269","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"Herald-Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldstandard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195397311","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/86/686926bf-576e-5857-8f9d-4602674b74c4/577185c846538.image.jpg?resize=300%2C221"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/86/686926bf-576e-5857-8f9d-4602674b74c4/577185c846538.image.jpg?resize=856%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

This fear was mostly because investors do not like surprises. It was assumed that Clinton would continue many of the same policies as Obama. Even if these were not investor\u2019s favorites, they knew what to expect.\n\nInstead, there was a honeymoon rally after the election results were announced. Stocks rallied to new heights. While people would expect Trump to be more pro-business, there remain a number of concerns. He promised that there would be fewer regulations. Business leaders like to know the rules of the game before they start to play. Parts of Dodd-Frank which was passed many years ago were never completed. Companies were required to have larger reserves and environmental policies got very restrictive. These can be very costly.\n\nWe are poised to see the economy grow because instead of only monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stimulating the economy, we should see finally some fiscal stimulus. This will come in the form of infrastructure spending. Fiscal policy is when Congress passes a spending bill and the President signs it. There has been so much gridlock in Washington, this has not been happening. This spending created jobs and stimulates the overall economy. This growth could help many companies increase spending and grow profits.\n\nFiscal policy also includes tax law changes. Trump has promised lower taxes. This can stimulate the economy and allow people to spend more money on purchases, creating additional economic growth. There is a concern if this increased spending and lower taxes will add to the deficit. That would mitigate some of the growth.\n\nThere is concern among many business leaders about the new president\u2019s stance on foreign trade. He has already scraped several trade agreements with other countries. If the U.S. raises tariffs on goods made overseas, it would be naive to think that these other countries will not retaliate against us. The world is one economic unit and what happens in other parts affect us all.\n\nMany U.S. companies export many products overseas. These policies will affect all of these sales. He is also threatening to punish companies that move jobs abroad. While this may sound good to some people, it creates artificial barriers that raise prices and create inflation. This could reduce company profits and thus lower stock valuations.\n\nCertain industries will do better under a Trump administration than if Clinton would have won the election and vice versa. You want to have your portfolio reflect these changes. For instance, healthcare would have done better under Clinton. Energy is likely to perform better under Trump. There has been some speculation that some company will create a Trump ETF that you could invest in. This is really not practical.\n\nIt is important to remember that no president gets everything that they want. They must get things through Congress even when their party controls both chambers. There will be budget restrictions and some changes just will not work.\n\nThe world\u2019s economy is very complex and interactive. It is impossible to know the exact outcome of every decision.

The library at the time was located in the former Fells Methodist Church.\n\n\u2018When I started, we were only on the balcony (of the building),\u201d Rendulic said. \u201cThe township offices were on the main floor. \u201cWe had less than 1,000 books. You signed them out in pencil.\u201d\n\nThe library now utilizes Athena, a Windows-based library system, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen the township moved out, we moved downstairs,\u201d Rendulic said.\n\nThe library would move to its new building on Plaza Drive in 2007.\n\nFifty years after graduating from McKeesport High School, Rendulic earned an associate degree in business management from Westmoreland County Community College, in 2000. She also holds a state certificate that permits her to direct a library which serves up to 15,000.\n\n\u201cI was just going to learn computers,\u201d Rendulic said. \u201cOur old library had one computer, which was brand new, and nobody used it. I learned Word Perfect and Lotus 1-2-3. I now use Excel.\u201d\n\nThe library has been a perfect fit for Rendulic\u2019s outgoing, friendly personality.\n\n\u201cI love people and I like to talk,\u201d Rendulic said. \u201cAnd I like the growth of the library.\u201d\n\nShe said the township library draw patrons from Perryopolis, West Newton and parts of Allegheny County.\n\n\u201cI tell my kids you have to learn something new every day,\u201d Rendulic said. \u201cSome people just sit at home, and that\u2019s not good for your brain.\u201d\n\nOn a typical day, Rendulic likes to catalog. At one time, she would type out each card for the catalog, but now she does the work on a computer.\n\nShe works Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. At one time, she worked 32 hours a week but has had to cut back her hours.\n\n\u201cWhen you get old, you get old,\u201d Rendulic said with a smile.\n\nNow 84, Rendulic has lived in Rostraver Township for the past 51 years.\n\nA 1950 graduate of McKeesport High School, she lived along Route 48 in McKeesport before the family home was condemned to widen the highway.\n\nRendulic\u2019s parents Francis Fink and Louis Vodopivec immigrated to the U.S. from Slovenia in the early 1920s. The couple married in Greensburg in 1923 before settling in McKeesport.\n\nIn 1973, she went back to Slovenia with her mother, visiting where her mother grew up and her father lived. Her mother\u2019s house had been destroyed during World War II.\n\n\u201cIt was under Communist control but we could go anywhere,\u201d Rendulic said. \u201cIt was a good experience.\u201d\n\nRendulic has brought together her love of books and her family.\n\nIn 2002, she wrote a book, \u201cMom\u2019s Cooking: Otherwise Known as Things I Don\u2019t Make Anymore.\u201d A copy of the book is in the Rostraver library.\n\nShe is now working on her family story, \u201cMy Story.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a large story. She is the mother of six. Frank Rendulic Jr., 63, lives in Dayton, Ohio; Louis Rendulic, 62, in Norfolk, Va.; Emma Hopeck, 58, in Library; Paul Rendulic, 56, and Frannie Rendulic, 53, both live with their mother; and Lisa Kingsbury, 48, in Los Angeles.\n\nShe also has four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\nIn her spare time, Rendulic likes to crochet, read and play games on the computer.\n\nRendulic said she watches very little television, usually the news and Jeopardy, then she goes into her room to listen to KDKA radio.\n\nShe likes to send cards to famous people, whether condolence cards to the estates of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Grace Kelly, or congratulations to Charles and Diane on their engagement.\n\nIt\u2019s the people who draw Rendulic to her job at the library.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of nice people here,\u201d Rendulic said.\n\nHer colleagues believe it has been a perfect fit for Rendulic.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been incredibly helpful for me adapting here,\u201d library Director Naomi Cross.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s made so many friends and brought a lot of people into the library,\u201d added Kelly Yoskosky, children\u2019s and adult programming coordinator.\n\n\u201cShe maintains those friendships. She\u2019ll be missed by a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIn retirement, Rendulic plans to occupy her time on her computer and spend more time with her to son and daughter who live at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting because I like to talk to people,\u201d Rendulic said. \u201cMaybe I can come and hang out at the library.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Christopher Buckley cbuckley@heraldstandard.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Executive moves news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Longtime Rostraver Public Library assistant director to retire","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Greene","zipCode":"15370","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Waynesburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald-Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"454406269","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"Herald-Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldstandard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195397697","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/64/a6454f60-4326-5fc3-b818-03b4955184ab/588ce8ce63ec9.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldstandard.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/64/a6454f60-4326-5fc3-b818-03b4955184ab/588ce8ce63ec9.image.jpg?resize=944%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

Is this a myth?  It\u2019s certainly a question I thought about, once, for a second or two\u2026 but I was never a particularly talented rider, so I groomed instead and learned a lot about what it takes to be a pro from that side of the fence. \n \nReally, any young rider considering making this their profession needs to ask themselves these two questions: \n \n1/ Is this my passion, what makes my heart sing, and what I imagine doing through all weathers for many years to come? \n \n2/ Can I make a profit? \n \nMost people find the first question really easy to answer, but funnily enough tend to avoid even thinking about the second. \n \nIt\u2019s one of those career choices where we often resign ourselves to being broke, and making sacrifices to live our passion, hoping some kind owner or benefactor will come along with lots of cash, and the sponsorships will flow on in. \n \nWhy not approach it a different way?  Being a professional rider is a matter of running your own small business, and in my opinion, rarely treated as such. \n \nYou can choose to \u201cwork to live\u201d, and build a career or a job away from horses to pay for your passion to train and compete.  You can also make the decision to build a business around your riding and training, and if you do, quite bluntly, it needs to be profitable or you will starve, and so will your horses. \n \nSo, how does one work out if this idea of being a professional rider is going to bring in an income for you?  By using the \u201cmagic\u201d of reverse engineering. \n \n\n \nTake a moment now to grab a piece of paper and pen, and a calculator. I want you to list all the expenses that you incur on a yearly basis.  Rent/ mortgage, phone, internet, gas, electricity, water, council rates, car servicing, insurances, food, entertainment, clothes etc.  Now, add up the expenses your horse/s incurs for you right now- agistment, feed, lessons, entries, tack, vet expenses, shoes etc.  Add all those numbers to get a total amount.  For and example, let\u2019s call it $45,000. \n \nNow, have a think about how you would like to LIVE your life.  Perhaps you want a holiday a year, a new float, a cleaner, and some savings.  Add up those amounts as a yearly figure as well- let\u2019s call that $25,000. \n \nAdd those two together, and then multiply that by 60% (for savings, unexpected expenses and tax).  What figure do you get?  I got $112,000 with my example numbers. \n \nSo what does this tell you?  It means you need that last figure (in my example, $112,000) in income to cover your expenses.  Ideally, you need that in profit from your venture, because you will have business expenses to cover as well. \n \nSo, say you plan to fund your life and your own horses in the example above as a riding coach, giving lessons for $80 per hour, per single rider.  Apart from travelling to and from locations, (fuel) and your memberships and insurances to allow you to do this, there are very few overheads, so let\u2019s say you make $70 profit. \n \nTo make your goal income of $112,000 you need to teach 1600 hours.  Over 48 weeks (you need some holidays!) that works out to be 33 lessons per week, or 6 lessons per day, on a 5 day week. \n \nIf you are taking in horses to train for other people, say at $350 per week, assuming your only expenses apart from your time is feed at say $70 per week, your profit is $280 per horse.  So, if you have one horse in work for the 48 weeks of the year, it will bring in $13,440.  To reach your goal of $112,000, you need to take in 9 horses, and have them for 48 weeks of the year. \n \nRunning the numbers like this is scary.  But it\u2019s a fun kind of scary, kinda like a roller coaster, because the numbers don\u2019t lie. They aren\u2019t emotional.  Data can\u2019t get passionate and excited.  It either works out, or it doesn\u2019t. \n \nOf course, the scenarios mentioned here are just simple examples, and most professional riders will have many different \u201cproducts\u201d or services that they offer and have the potential to make money off.  Breaking, schooling, problem solving, catch rides, lessons, clinics, float hire, arena hire, buying and selling on\u2026 \n \nIt\u2019s a matter of breaking it down, and seeing where the profit is coming from, and working out how you can do more of that to make the most of the time you have available to you each week. \n \nCan you see that is you taught monthly clinics, of 12 riders, at $280 per rider = $40,320 income.  Teach twice monthly clinics, $80,640 and you are 3/4s of the way to you income goal, with a lot more time during the week for other activities. \n \nYou can make money as a professional rider.  You can live a good lifestyle as a professional rider.  You don\u2019t need to live hand to mouth, and run yourself into the ground trying to make it work.  Run the numbers, work the figures.  Make a plan- but plan from the end backwards.  Reverse engineer how you will get there, and you will have a far better direction than any 29 page business plan will give you. \n \nRead Turning Pro Part 2 here \n \nAbout the author: Anita Marchesani built a successful retail business from scratch with her credit card, and then sold it to the perfect new owner.  Now she is helping other small businesses to their own version of success, which usually involved having more time to ride!  Get FREE business resources from her website, here","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: horse racing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Turning Pro - Part 1","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"An Eventful Life","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556497952","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"An Eventful Life","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","HorseRacing"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.an-eventful-life.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195399401","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2324","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Raymond Terrace","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Port Stephens Examiner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694033","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Port Stephens Examiner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195399695","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

If the rapid growth continues, the program's success could threaten its sustainability. \n   \nState leaders are happy to see the dual-credit program succeeding after a multi-million dollar investment. South Dakota started the program in 2014, allowing high school students to take discounted college courses for high school and college credit, the Argus Leader ( http://argusne.ws/2jQVzWF ) reports. It's aimed at making college more affordable. \n   \nRegents say the pool of eligible students would likely run dry before the program becomes a financial burden, but if it doesn't, or if state funding stagnates, regents would need to consider changes. \n   \n\"We'll continue supporting it for as long as it makes sense to do so,\" said Randy Schaefer, president of the Board of Regents. \n   \nGov. Dennis Daugaard has been a voice of strong support for dual-credit courses, and in his recent budget address he proposed increasing funding for the program. \n   \nWhen the state first began the program, demand overwhelmed initial projections. \n   \n\"There was far more interest in the program than we ever anticipated,\" said Paul Turman, vice president for academic affairs for the regents. \n   \nDual-credit costs the state $2 million, but it brings $4 million in savings to South Dakota students and families, said Tony Venhuizen, the governor's chief of staff. \n   \nMaia Gabrielson, a 17-year-old Roosevelt High School senior, is one of about 80 students in the Sioux Falls School District taking dual-credit courses. \n   \n\"I wanted to get a head start on my college courses,\" Gabrielson said. \n   \nShe completed algebra and composition classes and is enrolled in speech and government during the spring semester. The goal is to get generals out of the way so she can focus on her physical therapy major when she enrolls in the University of South Dakota this fall. \n   \nGabrielson maintains a 4.0 GPA, works two jobs and participates in varsity cheerleading. She said many of her friends take dual-credit courses, and all of them are equally involved and hard-working. \n   \n\"A lot of teachers encourage us to take these classes because they are cheaper and they know we can do it,\" Gabrielson said. \n   \nHigh school students pay only about $48 per credit hour, compared with close to $300 for other students in the state's four-year colleges. The state kicks in another $105 per credit as part of a special negotiated tuition rate with state universities. \n   \nThat's money well spent to Schaefer. He said the number one priority for regents is affordability, and the affordability of dual credit \"far outweighs\" any potential loss or gain in revenue. \n   \nSo far, the regents haven't lost money on dual-credit courses. \n   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nThe potential revenue lost through the lower tuition rate nearly balances out the money paid in by the state and dual credit students with a net gain of more than $35,000, according to a report presented to the Board of Regents in October. \n   \nIf the program continues to grow at the current rate, though, revenue losses could become a problem. \n   \nFor now, dual-credit students are filling open seats in existing course sections, meaning that the fixed cost of offering the class isn't changing. If enough students enroll and require schools to offer additional courses, costs would go up. \n   \nDual-credit tuition also doesn't account for general education versus high-level courses. A 100-level sociology course uses fewer materials and expenses than a 300-level chemistry course, but dual-credit tuition doesn't vary to account for those differences. \n   \n\"We may need to assess whether or not in the future 300- and 400-level courses need to be at a higher rate to pay for themselves,\" Turman said. \n   \nIt's too soon to tell how any potential monetary concerns will affect the sustainability of dual-credit classes in the future, he added. \n   \nFor now, though, the benefits outweigh the costs. \n   \nHaving high school students participating in college classes benefits the instructors too, said Michael Card, associate provost and dean of distance education at USD. \n   \n\"By adding high school students to our existing sections of courses,\" Card said. \"We get a degree of enthusiasm in an online course that you ordinarily wouldn't get.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"More high school students take classes through universities","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Plymouth","zipCode":"51031","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Le Mars","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sioux City Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659120","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2875"},"name":"Sioux City Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.siouxcityjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://argusne.ws/2jQVzWF"],"sequenceId":"695195401474","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2324","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Raymond Terrace","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Port Stephens Examiner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694033","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Port Stephens Examiner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195402239","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Both were terrific from the back and at the net too. \n \nSania was also broken in the third game. It was Cabal's brilliant volley pick up which he placed well beyond the two players to earn a break point. \n \nSpears smashed a backhand service return winner to take the break as the second seeds trailed 0-3. \n \nThe American had an easy hold in the next to make it 4-0. The second seeds finally got on board when Dodig held the fifth game but they had already suffered the damage. \n \nServing to stay in the opening set at 1-5, Sania saved a deciding a point to hold. \n \nSpears was now serving for the set and lost the first two points to be 0-30 and soon Dodig found a forehand winner to earn a breakpoint but could not convert. Sania hit a backhand wide on the deciding point to concede the first set. \n \nDodig's serve was again under pressure as he faced a breakpoint and a deciding point in the first game of the second set but managed to save both. \n \nCabal served a double fault at 40-30 to face a deciding point and the second seeds latched on to that to take a 2-0 lead as Spears hit a backhand long. \n \nSania had an easy hold to make it 3-0 as the Indo-Croatian pair was back in the match. However, Sania was broken in the seventh game which allowed the rivals to neutralise the advantage. \n \nThe Indian committed a double fault to be down by two breakpoints and Spears smashed one overhead volley to convert the first. Spears held without fuss and the two pairs were now locked 4-4. \n \nDodig was never in his elements in Sunday's match and he served two double faults, the second one coming on a breakpoint, to allow Cabal to serve out the championship.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open: Sania Mirza-Ivan Dodig fall at the final hurdle","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195412975","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Bryant Crawford, pushing his dribble out of the backcourt and driving on Duke guard Frank Jackson, floated up a runner that didn\u2019t reach the rim with 0.3 seconds left. \n \nWith that, with a relieved smile forming across interim coach Jeff Capel\u2019s face and Kennard then spiking the ball in celebration at the final horn, Duke had survived. After the foul trouble that ensnared its big men, after the dustup that of course centered Grayson Allen, the Blue Devils closed on a 14-2 run and could exhale. \n \n\u201cWe let out,\u201d Kennard said. \u201cWe were free.\u201d \n \nThe week started with Dennis Smith\u2019s masterpiece that fueled North Carolina State\u2019s stunning victory at Duke\u2019s Cameron Indoor Stadium and went on to include Capel\u2019s revelation of his father\u2019s ALS diagnosis and the ESPN report of coach Mike Krzyzewski, recovering from back surgery, barring the Blue Devils from wearing Duke-related gear and entering their own locker room. \n \nIt ended with whoops and hollers spilling into the hallway outside the closed door to the visiting locker room here. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been hell,\u201d guard Matt Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s been so tough, not only physically but mentally. But for the guys to really show resiliency and to come out and fight hard like we did and overcome so much and get this win, we took a big step in the right direction.\u201d \n \nGrayson Allen added 19 points and six rebounds. He drained five 3s, the last of which, the result of by brisk ball movement, chopped Wake Forest\u2019s shrinking lead to 83-82 with 57.5 seconds remaining. \n \nAbout 4½ minutes earlier, Allen tangled with Crawford chasing a loose ball into the corner. Crawford already had taken issue with contact from Allen. This time, bodies from both teams shoved together in front of the Duke bench. Wake Forest guard Brandon Childress received a technical foul when he pushed his way into the fray. \n \nBy that juncture, Duke\u2019s Jayson Tatum had fouled out and forwards Amile Jefferson and Giles had been saddled with four fouls for some time. The Blue Devils, with no other recourse, turned to seldom-used Antonio Vrankovic and Jack White as subs in the post. \n \n\u201cI think we did a good job of just continuing to play,\u201d Allen said. \n \nCrawford\u2019s 26 points and Collins\u2019 20 points and eight rebounds topped the contributions for Wake Forest. \n \nThe Demon Deacons, in control for so long \u2014 they led for more than 30 minutes of game time \u2014 struggled to get preferred looks out of their offense during crunch time. In the final 79 seconds, as Wake Forest tried to withstand Duke\u2019s rally, Wilbekin air-balled a 3-pointer late in the shot clock and Keyshawn Woods forced up and missed a 3 under pressure. \n \nThen, out of a timeout with 15.5 seconds left, Frank Jackson dribbled out high as Kennard lost Wilbekin with a hesitation move while running the baseline and curling around Giles\u2019 screen. \n \n\u201cWe drew up a play and we executed it the way it was drawn up,\u201d Kennard said. \u201cJust setting my man up, created a little space and Harry did a great job of getting me open.\u201d \n \nKennard let it go and ... bang. \n \n\u201cGuys just followed his lead,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLuke\u2019s a competitor, he wants to win. And when you want to win badly enough and when you\u2019re desperate enough, you do things that are spectacular, and he did that.\u201d \n \nThe Demon Deacons led 42-32 at halftime, largely without Collins, their top scorer and rebounder. He left 4½ minutes into the game, parked on the bench by two early fouls. \n \nDuke connected on just two field goals \u2014 both of them Allen 3s \u2014 in the last six minutes before halftime, stumbling into intermission shooting 35.5 percent. \n \nKennard and Tatum, the Blue Devils\u2019 best scorers on the season, were non-factors in the first half. They combined for six points. Fouls reduced Kennard. He picked up his second foul in the opening 2½ minutes. \n \nMeanwhile, Crawford and Woods found their attacking gear and pumped in 16 of Wake Forest\u2019s final 18 points of the first half, as the lead grew from 24-22 to 42-32 in a matter of 6","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adam Smith Times-News @adam_smithTN"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Rescue mission: Duke escapes Wake Forest behind clutch Kennard","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Gaston","zipCode":"28054","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gastonia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gaston Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665495","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"153"},"name":"Gaston Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gastongazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195413722","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:16:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A major generator of Victoria's coal-fired electricity is set to be expanded, sparking protests from environment groups over the effect on carbon emissions.\n\nThe planned upgrade of the Loy Yang B power station in the Latrobe Valley comes as its majority owner, Engie, prepares to shut down the Hazelwood plant and coal mine in March.\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted \"works approval\" to upgrade turbines at the plant, which will result in the burning of an extra 400,000 tonnes of coal each year.\n\nLoy Yang B provides about 17 per cent of Victoria's energy needs.\n\nThe EPA insists it has imposed strict conditions on the power generator, so there will be no additional detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nEPA development assessments manager Tim Faragher said the decision allowed higher-efficiency turbine blades to be fitted to the power-generating units.\n\nHe said the new turbines would improve power generation capacity 8.6 per cent but decrease the intensity of emissions by 5 per cent.\n\n\"The upgrade will make Loy Yang B the least greenhouse-intensive brown coal-fired power generator in Victoria,\" Mr Faragher said.\n\nHe said at least 114 megawatts of coal-fired electricity generation capacity had to be retired before the upgrade could proceed. However, the closure of Hazelwood would satisfy that reduction.\n\nHazelwood produced about 13 per cent of Victoria's emissions and up to a quarter of its electricity.\n\nEnvironment Victoria chief executive Mark Wakeham said the EPA's decision was \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nThe plant's expansion would make it harder for the state government to reach its target of zero emissions by 2050, he said.\n\n\"If Victoria is to keep its commitments to contribute to global efforts to stay below two degrees of warming, brown coal-power stations need to be phased out urgently,\" Mr Wakeham said.\n\nThe EPA confirmed that burning the additional coal would result in a 4 per cent increase in carbon emissions at Loy Yang B.\n\nBut Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the decision meant lower emissions for Victoria.\n\nLatrobe Valley community group Voices of the Valley has also raised concerns about the expansion. The group's president, Wendy Farmer, said the power station's pollution allowance was too high.\n\nEngie welcomed the move, saying the upgrade would improve the station's efficiency and \"increase operating flexibility\".\n\nThe upgrade will occur in 2019 and 2020 during \"planned major outages\". In a community update issued before the approval, Engie described Loy Yang B as one of the most efficient power stations in the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\"The new turbine design for the retrofit of the existing turbines will result in further improvement,\" it said.\n\nLoy Yang B employs about 150 full-time staff. It is supplied with coal by a neighbouring mine.\n\nFriends of the Earth criticised the expansion, saying it would prolong coal generation when urgent action was required to tackle climate change.\n\n\"It's time to bring the EPA into the 21st century so it can play a key role in tackling climate change,\" the group said.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Engie hopes to sell Loy Yang B.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cass","zipCode":"58103","state":"North Dakota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fargo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KFGO News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169684857","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1704"},"name":"KFGO News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kfgo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195416028","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The number of H2-A visas has increased over the years as labor has been more in demand, the Farm Bureau said, but the program remains controversial as farmers say it is expensive and takes too long, and some worker advocates criticize it for tying workers to one single employer. \n \n \n\u201cPresident Trump is demonizing immigrants and blaming them for ills in this country for which they\u2019re not responsible and not offering constructive policy changes,\u201d said Bruce Goldstein, president of nonprofit organization Farmworker Justice. \u201cThe large majority of farm workers are immigrants. They are contributing to our economy by harvesting vegetables, working in dairies, tending to livestock.\u201d \n \nRestaurants and other food industry businesses could also be affected. \n \nRestaurant Opportunities Center United, a nonprofit organization that advocates for restaurant workers, penned an open letter to Trump in November, urging him to \u201cspeak out to alleviate the fear of deportation or other harassment of immigrant workers in our industry\u201d and to \u201cchoose a plan for an achievable path to citizenship for all workers over deportation.\u201d \n \nAs one of the fastest growing sectors in the U.S., the letter said the restaurant industry continues to expand while facing the \u201cabsolute worst labor shortage in recent memory.\u201c \n \nMany in the restaurant and agriculture industry have called for comprehensive immigration reform that provides paths to citizenship for immigrants working in the U.S., as well as a streamlined process for allowing industries like the agriculture and food business to get the workers they need. \n \n\u201cPresident Trump is doing what he said he was going to do, but he also said he would put doors in the wall to allow people to work in a legitimate way, \u201c said Little, of the Farm Bureau. \u201cWe think working in our industry is a legitimate reason, and we view our role as helping the president figure out how to make those doors.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Annie Sciacc Bay Area News Group"},"topics":[{"name":"Food industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Why Trump's immigration actions should worry food businesses","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Yolo","zipCode":"95695","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Woodland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Woodland Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665446","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"17"},"name":"Woodland Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailydemocrat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195417505","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:22:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Eden Magnet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169772193","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Eden Magnet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.edenmagnet.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195423602","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The commissioners say the order was abrupt, and didn't leave room for preparation. \n\n\"As the operators of this airport, we are deeply concerned that the abrupt nature of the executive order did not allow adequate process for public agencies such as ourselves to provide service that travelers and families expect and deserve,\" the statement read. \"We took it upon ourselves to request a full briefing from Customs and Border Protection to understand how they are addressing this situation.  We respect these hard working federal employees who are under tremendous strain.  However, when we felt that traveler needs were not fully met, the Port of Seattle stepped up.  We started providing private waiting areas for families here at the airport and connecting families to lawyers who can help advocate for their rights and the rights of their loved ones.\" \n\n \nEarlier on Saturday, there was outrage that some Sound Transit light rail trains were skipping the Sea-Tac stop. Transportation leaders are set to meet on Monday to discuss how to handle such situations in the future. \n\n On Monday, leaders from ST and Metro will meet to evaluate and develop a clear protocol moving forward. \n\u2014 Dow Constantine (@kcexec) January 29, 2017  \nAlso on Saturday, Gov.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family.

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Eden Magnet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169772193","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Eden Magnet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.edenmagnet.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195425568","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:29:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/ee974bdb-c7e3-4991-93f1-8b638bee948c.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

AMG shot its GT and GT S straight at the heart of the 911, now it is going after the 911 GT3 with the GT R which is due in SA in the second quarter of 2017. And its aim has been surgically precise. It\u2019s a solidly stiff road car but an incandescent track car that sounds like an entire Nascar field. Porsche used to have this market all to itself. You could spend a bit less and get a BMW M3 of one sort or another or spend a bit more for a near-pure track car, but to get something you were happy driving home again, you had to get a 911 GT3. You don\u2019t have to get a 911 GT3 anymore. In fact, you\u2019d be almost legally culpable if you didn\u2019t have a drive of one of these things before you turned up at Porsche with a cheque. The GT R takes everything from the GT and GT S programmes and makes it stronger, lighter, more powerful and more precise. Everything from a 57mm stretch in width to how it steers to how it bites at the road to how it makes the airflow massage, it has all been changed. And it\u2019s all been changed to make it go faster, everywhere, all the time. It\u2019s not hard to tell this one was a passion project at AMG, which brought its GT racing engineers and aerodynamicists into play right from the start. Everybody from boss Tobias Moers to the lowliest apprentice has been asked for their ideas to make the GT S faster and too many dinners were left cooling on family tables as they sorted through them and nutted out the details. Of course, AMG didn\u2019t neglect the engine. The dry-sumped 4.0l twin turbo V8 has 430kW of power and 700Nm of torque, which sprint it to 100km/h in 3.6 seconds. That\u2019s only a tenth quicker than the GT S (and 0.2 seconds slower than the family man\u2019s E63 S) but the real reason the GT R exists is that this car is more than 20 seconds faster than the GT S around the Nürburgring\u2019s Nordschleife circuit. With an independent German magazine clocking 7:10.9, it\u2019s the new holder of the production road car record. That doesn\u2019t happen with just a bit more power. It happens with a bit more everything. They\u2019ve taken out weight with things like carbon fibre front wings, propshaft and the torque tube to the rear-mounted transaxle, but they\u2019ve also put weight back in with rear-wheel steering and a host of carbon fibre reinforcements, so the net gain for the 1,555kg car is only 15kg. Then there is the stance, which is wider by about 5cm at both ends, sitting on new coilover springs and dampers, with custom-developed settings, plus a cool nine-step adjustable traction control, which only works in the Race mode when the skid-control is turned off. Then the aero coves joined in, adding a flat, carbon fibre undertray behind the fixed splitter that drops down 40mm to create a venturi effect above 80km/h in Race mode (or 120km/h in girlier modes). It reduces the front end\u2019s lift by 40kg at 240km/h, though its work is added to by a set of louvres that open and close to change the car\u2019s downforce levels to add grip in corners and reduce drag on straights. There\u2019s also a massive double diffuser at the back; the primary job is to use underfloor air to suck the back end onto the ground, while the second part borrows an idea from the Braun Formula 1 team to do the same thing with redirected radiator-cooling air. There\u2019s also an adjustable rear wing and besides all of these pieces reducing lift all over the car (don\u2019t believe anybody who tells you they give the GT R \"downforce\" because they don\u2019t), they actually reduce its overall drag.It gets bigger boots, with 275/35 ZR19 front and 325/30 ZR20 rear tyres, while implausibly light alloy wheels and carbon ceramic anchors are both optional and save another 4kg of unsprung mass per corner.Yes, this car is the five-alarm chilli of the AMG world and, combined with the E63 it\u2019s just launched, it clearly represents a turning point for a company that could have easily slipped into building profit-rich, mildly warm versions of all the Mercedes-Benz production cars and SUVs.This is AMG at its most focused, more surgical than it has ever been, producing a car that\u2019s neither the most expensive nor the most powerful it\u2019s ever made, but easily the most precisely targeted. It has all the usual built-in multimedia niceties of the stock GT, including navigation, a Burmeister sound system, air conditioning, a head-up display, connectivity for smartphones and a seat choice between electric sports seats and lighter manually operated hard-core sports seats. There\u2019s even a track pack, with a half-cage behind the front seats (which can be painted in the body\u2019s colour), a four-point harness and even stickier tyres. The thing is, it\u2019s hard to know which of these areas stands out the most. It\u2019s obvious while it\u2019s sitting still, though. Static, the star is the engine and, more specifically, how all that burnt air works its way out the back. It\u2019s loud from the inside, louder from the outside and it\u2019s loud in a way that makes the very word \"loud\" seem inadequate. And that\u2019s in the default start-up mode (Sport, incidentally). It\u2019s deep, it rumbles, it has a slightly odd, off-beat burble to it and the tacho needle responds to the throttle like someone jumped on the other end of it. For all that, the engine is perhaps the least fiddled bit of the car. The modular V8 is dry-sumped, like it is in the GT, but runs different mapping, a slightly higher compression ratio and more turbo boost (up to 1.35 bar) to thump out an extra 55kW. To give it more agility, the dual-mass flywheel is 0.7kg lighter, The seven-speed dual-clutch gets a taller first gear, a shorter seventh and a shorter final-drive ratio, while the rear diff is now so tight that ours graunched on full-lock turns. The critical new addition, overlooked in favour of sexier aero talk, is the active rear-wheel steering, governed by a massive electric motor on each wheel and moving the toe angle up to 1.5°, with no physical connection to the steering wheel whatsoever. There are also uniball bearings on the rear, which don\u2019t change their toe angle under hard cornering and are harder wearing than wishbone bushes. So that\u2019s just scratching the surface of what AMG has done to turn the twitchy GT S into the brilliant GT R. And it is brilliant. The Black Series was the most precise of the old SLS coupes and it\u2019s the same here. You have to put a lot of effort into driving a GT S quickly, but you get more reward, for the same effort, in the GT R. It\u2019s also now just fast enough that you physically feel like you\u2019ve had a workout after an afternoon of fast lappery. How fast is it? Realistically, it\u2019s lets-sit-down-and-recalibrate fast. It\u2019s properly fast. It\u2019s scorchingly fast. It\u2019s not sneaky fast. It\u2019s not sneaky anything. Definitely not the kind of car that flies under the radar (the noise alone takes care of that), the GT R succeeds both on sheer speed on a circuit and it delivers a huge leap on giving the driver an experience to soak up and enjoy. It starts, as every AMG does, with the engine note. The titanium exhaust turns its work into something that, in Sport+ or Race mode (or when you just push the Loudenator button) is so loud that just five of the things together would frighten off an alien invasion. It\u2019s an astonishingly brutal noise that is deeper than anything of just four litres has a right to be, yet rich, thick and carries an underlying sophistication to it. Then you lift off or brake and downshift and the pops and crackles are so exaggerated they make the just-launched, very loud E63 seem like it\u2019s scrunching up a bit of paper by comparison. And it matches that theatre with epic performance. Sure, 3.6 seconds to 100km/h is only a tenth quicker than the stock one, but that\u2019s missing the point. It\u2019s belligerently flexible, with the torque peak hitting at only 1,900r/min and it\u2019s belligerently loud while doing it. If it\u2019s not just Porsches it\u2019s chasing, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Aston are all incapable of making noise like this. If you\u2019ve driven 50m and still overlook just how much more precise the car is, then you\u2019ve got no business driving it. It\u2019s wasted on you. The new carbon fibre braces, joining the underbody sides to the torque tube, give it an extra 7% of torsional rigidity. The torque tube itself adds more rigidity, so do a host of other braces. And the car is just astonishingly accurate now. Too accurate, to be fair, on public roads. We found wet roads and mud all over the mountain passes of the Algarve in Portugal and the ride was at least firm in every mode, with the car snapping into wheelspin over muddy patches even in fifth or sixth gear with modest throttle inputs and little suspension compliance to help out. On really bad roads, well, it might be just too hard for some people. Where the GT S\u2019s steering feedback suffers from its cab-rearward stance, the GT R is pin sharp and more intuitive. It still slides and it still runs out of grip, but it\u2019s phenomenally easy to control, even with the traction control turned off completely. To be safe, you can run it in Sport+ or in Race with the skid-control either on or in Sport mode. That way you keep some traction control plus some skid-control when the car starts to slide. The fun way is to attack it in Race with the skid-control off all the way (hold the button down for five seconds), then you control the slides with your feet and hands and you control the traction control with the unmistakable bright yellow knob beneath the air vents.It will light up as you turn it (with a mirror version in the dash display, in case you missed it) and it will light up the rear tyres more as you turn it down to off. There are nine stages, with the first for wet driving, the last for off and then there\u2019s everything in between.The whole package adds up to a machine that\u2019s a joy to drive, all the time. You attack corners deeper and deeper under brakes because it bites and bites and bites.You fiddle with the front end in fast and slow corners because it will dive hard for the apex even if you\u2019ve still got a rude amount of friction squeezing the brake calipers together.And you jump on the throttle harder and earlier, every lap, because the rear end (which has 52.7% of the weight) is simply accepting all the power you\u2019re giving it and punching the car forward, harder and harder.It works the other way, too, with an innate ability to pivot around the centre of its axis that\u2019s highly sought after and rarely found, along with responding to throttle lift-offs sharply and precisely to bring the nose closer to the apex on both fast and slow bends.It\u2019s also almost infinitely adjustable in a corner and you can drive it on understeer or oversteer, you can drive it leaning on the back wheels or the front and you can fling it into high-speed four-wheel drifts at will, even over sharp camber changes and crests.It is equally happy and able to drive it cleanly to set lap times or loosely to hang out and have a blast and it is more accurate to the touch than any Benz-badged road car in history.At one point, with the stickier boots on, we were emerging onto Portimao\u2019s front straight at 200km/h and braking at the end at well over 290. Sure, it can slide, buck and dance over bumps and hard cornering, but it leaves you with the unshakable impression that it\u2019s dancing to the driver\u2019s tune and the driver\u2019s tune alone.There will be a day when it lines up head to head against the 911 GT3 and even the GT3 RS and the McLaren 570S, but there are plenty of reasons to like it, even in that company.That, and it\u2019s also front-engined and rear-drive and happy to slide.

A number of towns and communities all around Jamaica have on occasion come together to recognise leading citizens where, in the absence of national honours, they pay tribute in a simple and unpretentious manner to the fathers and mothers of their place of origin. \n \nRecognition has not been confined to age. In many cases the young and the middle age have also been singled out for some outstanding act considered worthy of acknowledgement. These community projects are usually carried out during National Heritage Week at parish council functions or in the inner-city version of our rural districts. \n \nThey constitute the great untold stories of unsung heroes throughout our history who may never be invited to King\u2019s House for the glitter and glamour of the Governor General\u2019s Awards ceremony. Notwithstanding that, the plaques, the bouquets, the certificates presented at the local level are just as treasured as the Order of Distinction or the Order of Jamaica. \n \nThe Discovery Bay function is hosted by the Noranda Community Council, one of the community organisations standing beside the Community Development Committee; the schools\u2019 parent-teacher and past students\u2019 associations; the church organisations; as well as the football, netball and youth club management committees. \n \nThe Noranda Community Council ceremony is by no means unique, as parallel organisations also recognise their outstanding individuals at annual presentations, achievement days, at funerals, and so on. The council has, however, kept careful record of the citations read and presented which describe in brief the stories of lives spent in voluntary service in the fields of education, agriculture, religion, business, health, sports, youth and community, and (with regard to corporate contribution) the bauxite industry. \n \nThe council has gone deep into the community to highlight contributions made by senior citizens, some in their late 90s, where glowing tributes recall lives spent in unselfish service and dedication to district and community development by nurses, midwives, veteran Sunday school teachers, grandmothers, bush medicine dispensers, and educators. Those elders continue to impart advice and wisdom gained from their experiences with the younger citizens. They have little to show in material wealth, but are satisfied with the love and respect they have earned over the years. \n \nAt this year\u2019s presentation the story of Hezekiah Whitehorn, 98 years old, was a revelation to the younger members of the community who were hearing for the first time that the retired church organist from Queenhythe district once sang with the famous East Queen Street Baptist Fraternal, and that his golden baritone voice was once heard regularly on \n \nRadio Jamaica in the 1950s. \n \n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said the citation, \u201chis greatest legacy to us was when he formed the famous singing group the Trumpeteers out of the choir of the Grateful Hill Baptist Church in the 1970s and 80s. Anyone who has heard the Trumpeteers as they performed all over Jamaica will recall the delight and the thrill felt when those voices rang out in rich musical harmony\u201d. \n \nAnther golden nugget showcased by the council was Daisy Wallace, 99 years old, from Farm Town district, \u201cwhose love, warmth and congeniality are evident in her daily discourse with others, and who became a mother, counsellor, and role model to hundreds of persons and generations of years\u201d. \n \nThe council also went overseas this year as they honoured Whitfield Stennett, MBE. Stennett, born in Old Folly district adjacent to Discovery Bay, has not only remained a humble person, always exhibiting the good manners and deportment natural to Jamaicans birthed in modest but dignified circumstances, but has also been a stalwart providing cricket gear and sports gear and other charitable donations to his elementary school, Discovery Bay, and to his community. He rose to become one of the first black mayors in the United Kingdom. \n \nIt was at one of those council functions that I met up with and heard the story of Cynthia \u201cBreezy\u201d Watkis, midwife, who for countless years has been on call to her community for her nursing services, especially in times of dire need. Inez \u201cDulcie\u201d Duncan, legendary mother, grand and great mother, who walked miles across rugged terrain, where no vehicle could go in the early days, to transport milk and other basics for families and shut-ins. \n \nAnd where we heard the story of Albert \u201cBertie\u201d Edwards, who in the 1950s took up the fight to organise the Discovery Bay communities against the landed class that had attempted to keep out Kaiser Bauxite from starting up industry, and subsequent jobs and income generation, in the parish. \n \nThere is another rural district in Jamaica, the home of my birth, Four Paths in Clarendon, that has taken the time and considerable effort to compile the story of the village in magazine format. \n \nThe publication was put together by Brenda Black and Lauris Goldson in 2012, and as I read it I was surprised at the background stories that I was barely familiar with as a young boy now being brought to full life in the recounting of the facts by those who witnessed the events. \n \nIn the pages I found confirmation of some of the accounts of life in a village which had only been learned from elder brothers and friends. Thanks to the writers\u2019 research, I could now relate more closely to the backgrounds of the original families of Four Paths, the Waddells, the Lawsons, the Vassells, the Davises, the Rickettses, the Baileys, the Shimhues, the Howes, the Christies, the McGlashens, the Shouts, the Pennicookes, the Burrells, the Bacchuses, the Webleys, among many others (condolence to the Vassells on the recent loss of Carol). \n \nThe introduction to the magazine is instructive, as the writers explain their purpose in compiling the stories. \n \n\u201cCentral to our heritage is the revered institution we call family. The family is one of society\u2019s main and arguably the most important social institution, because it serves to socialise individuals to be productive members of society. We all look to our families for guidance, support and a sense of belonging. Sociologists have long argued that the family is not only an institution, but is also a social system with norms and values that are cultivated over many years. These norms and values are designed in order to guide the socialisation of each family member with the hope that they will function effectively in a world that has become more complex with each passing day.\u201d \n \nBlack and Goldson chose to focus on two elements in recounting the history of Four Paths, places and people. \n \nAnd similar to the dossier compiled on Discovery Bay\u2019s personalities and legends, the magazine describes a village typical of many rural villages across Jamaica, with strong foundations centred on the church and school, parental values, discipline, and their own unique history. \n \nIn the magazine, Four Paths is proud of its history. Where else, it asks, but Four Paths, could a woman have bowled George Headley on a bet she could do so within three balls \u2014 that woman was Daisy Waddell-Lawson. And where else in Jamaica, can you find a village of the size of Four Paths that could produce a Miss Jamaica (Karlene Waddell), three parish beauty queens, and a Miss Jamaica Farm Queen? Where else in Jamaica, but Four Paths, could produce two presidents of the Jamaica Council of Churches: Rev C Evans Bailey and Rev Stanford Webley. \n \nAnd where else but Four Paths can boast the records of one family producing the head of the civil service, a president of the University of Technology, Jamaica, and a minister of finance \u2014 brothers Drs Carlton Davis, Rae Davis, and Omar Davis? \n \nI have learnt a lot about the values of community lifestyles by just referring to the Discovery Bay profiles and to the stories and legends of the founders of my home district in Clarendon. Those of the first generation started the process and then passed on the baton to their heirs and successors with a very important message, \u201cPreserve and protect what has been given to you.\u201d \n \nLance Neita is a public and community relations consultant.

President Trump has identified tax reform as one of his top priorities, and legislation is expected to move quickly in the new Congress. \n \nIn a tax-deferred exchange, owners can postpone recognition of gains on investment real estate when they swap one property for another of \u201clike kind.\u201d The capital gains tax that would otherwise be due gets deferred until the owner sells the replacement property and receives cash. \n \nUnder Section 1031, a rental house in Santa Barbara, Calif., might be exchanged for an investment duplex in suburban Chicago. Oklahoma farmland could be exchanged for rental condos in Washington, D.C., Boston or Miami. Exchanges are also used to further environmental protection objectives, such as through swaps involving conservation easements to preserve habitat and prevent future development. \n \nTo qualify for tax deferral, exchanges must follow a detailed set of IRS rules specifying the timing for identifying replacement properties and transaction closing deadlines. An entire industry of \u201cqualified intermediaries\u201d exists to facilitate exchanges by escrowing proceeds and administering transactions to comply with IRS rules. Real estate held for short periods and then flipped to new purchasers do not qualify for tax deferred exchanges, nor do owner-occupied residences. \n \nLoss of the ability to use an exchange would be a significant blow to small-scale realty investors. According to a study posted on the website of the National Rental Home Council, there were 15.7 million rental homes in the U.S. as of 2015, and 99 percent of them were owned by non-institutional investors. A study by professors at the University of Florida and Syracuse University estimated that most exchanges involve relatively small properties; in 2011, 59 percent had a sale price of less than $1 million. \n \nBill Horan of Realty Exchange Corp. in Gainesville, Va., told me about a small investor who swapped a rental home in Virginia for a rental condo in Fort Myers, Fla., where he intends to move for retirement. \u201cHe wanted to own property near where he\u2019s going to live,\u201d said Horan. Since the Fort Myers unit cost $412,000 and the rental home he relinquished was valued at $525,000, the investor ended up paying a modest amount of capital gains taxes. \n \nExchanges have been on congressional tax writers\u2019 hit lists before, in part because they generate tax \u201cexpenditures\u201d \u2014 losses of otherwise immediately collectible revenue for the federal government. In December 2015, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that during fiscal 2017, exchanges would generate tax expenditures of $11.7 billion attributable to corporations and $6 billion attributable to individual taxpayers. For the same year, by comparison, revenue losses caused by deductions for mortgage interest and local property taxes by individual homeowners were much larger \u2014 $84.3 billion and $36.9 billion, respectively. \n \nExchange proponents, such as Suzanne Baker of Investment Property Exchange Services in Chicago, argue that most of the deferred taxes ultimately are collected when properties get sold for cash, and that exchanges stimulate economic activity. \n \nBottom line: If you own investment real estate, and have contemplated a Section 1031 exchange, be aware: There\u2019s a significant possibility that tax reform could knock your plans off track. Keep a close eye on what\u2019s happening, because it could happen fast.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Tax reform could knock your investment plans off track","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Middlesex","zipCode":"02149","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Everett","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Boston Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661766","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Boston Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bostonherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195439173","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And good leadership is always relevant.\u201d \n \nThe Diocese of Joliet has 60 schools, and while it\u2019s true the number of schools has decreased over the years, the current total is holding steady, Belmonte said. The last two schools to close were both in Joliet \u2013 St. Joseph\u2019s (eight years ago) and St. Patrick\u2019s (seven years ago). \n \nPeople may assume a school closes because of lack of enrollment, but it\u2019s more likely because of a demographic area having fewer families and fewer children. Also, schools can occasionally have financial difficulties that lead to closure, Belmonte said. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some enrollment declines in general,\u201d Belmonte said, \u201cbut the schools in the diocese are very well-managed.\u201d \n \nIncreased tuition is challenging, but scholarships and assistance on the parish level help make Catholic education affordable, Belmonte said. \n \n\u201cChoosing a Catholic school is a good way to invest in your child and in your child\u2019s future,\u201d Belmonte said. \u201cNo doubt families, especially those who have more economic challenges, find tuition a challenge for them. But most of our families, I believe, when they see what the school is doing for their children, and how it is a support to them, know that\u2019s money well spent.\u201d \n    \nNevertheless, a family may spend a substantial amount on tuition \u2013 and that\u2019s before the cost of uniforms, at schools still using them. Immaculate Conception is not one of them, although it does have a dress code, which mandates dressier clothes on Fridays for all-school Masses, said Kim DesLauriers, principal for 37 years . \n \nThe good old days \n \nDesLauriers said tuition at Immaculate Conception was $175 per family in 1980 \u2013 with a book fee of $25 for the year. Today, the cost is $3,600 for one student and the book fee is $250, DesLauriers said. The fourth \u2013 or more \u2013 child in a family attends for free, he added. \n \nThat\u2019s small comfort for financially struggling families. \n \n\u201cPeople are paying three, four, five hundred dollars a month,\u201d DesLauriers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large payment, a big sacrifice. We don\u2019t want to turn our backs on people who want it and can\u2019t afford it, so we\u2019ve got to make allowances for them. Catholic schools were created years ago for, basically, the immigrant families, the people new to this country, and it was pretty much free. It\u2019s not just a school for the rich.\u201d \n \nFinancial help is available at the diocesan level through the Catholic Education Foundation and on the parish level through scholarship money raised by members of Immaculate Conception Parish, DesLauriers said. \n \nBut even providing this last option is daunting as church collections have \u201cpretty much flat-lined,\u201d DesLauriers said. In addition, schools have fewer sisters from congregations teaching than in the past \u2013 Immaculate Conception has one, he said \u2013 but hiring lay teachers also means paying salary and benefits, whereas the sisters were frequently financially supported by the congregation. \n \nAlso, Immaculate Conception Parish used to pay a greater percentage of the school budget \u2013 close to 75 percent, DesLauriers said. Today, it\u2019s around 25 percent, he added. \n \n\u201cThe increase is picked up by charging families for it,\u201d DesLauriers said. \u201cBut if we can meet the needs of the child and the family sincerely wants to go here, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d \n \nOne hidden cost of increased tuition is the advance of technology and its role in education. Purchasing equipment and updating buildings to handle it \u2013 Immaculate Conception was built in 1972 \u2013 all costs money, DesLauriers said. \n \n\u201cWhen this building was built, there was electrical outlets in front of the room and in back of the room,\u201d DesLauriers said, \u201cand that was to plug in the overhead projector.\u201d \n   \nPros and cons \n \nYet skimping on technology and specialty services also comes at a cost. Amy Sheehan of Joliet started her children in a Catholic school, but when her son Aidan Sheehan, now 14, developed a processing disorder, the school didn\u2019t have the resources to adequately address it, although it tried, Amy said. \n \n\u201cHe had one wonderful teacher who would just read to him and she did it on her own time,\u201d Amy said. \n \nSo Amy transferred Aidan to Troy School District 30-C, where he blossomed academically, Amy said, as did his siblings \u2013 Grace Sheehan, now 12, and Meghan Sheehan, now 9. Amy felt this was due to \u201cwonderful teachers\u201d and a program that met his needs. \n \nBut Amy felt Aidan\u2019s moral values declined at Troy. A friend recommended St. Jude Catholic School in Joliet to Amy. Its Catholic environment, where classrooms are named for saints and sisters exemplify religious vocations, reinforced the Catholic standards in the Sheehan home, so Amy transferred all three children to St. Jude. \n \nFurthermore, the small class size allowed teachers extra time to work with Aidan, but it wasn\u2019t as ideal as a structured program, Amy said. \n \n\u201c[Catholic schools] need somebody, or a team of people, whose full-time job is to sit with these kids who are not honor students and who need that extra push and that extra help along the way,\u201d Amy said. \u201cThe classroom teachers are fabulous and tried their very best, but they are classroom teachers and they have other students with needs to be met.\u201d \n \nAmy wants to send Aidan to Joliet Catholic Academy but she and her husband, Tim Sheehan, can\u2019t afford its tuition \u2013 even if they should get financial assistance \u2013 and that\u2019s with both parents working. The tuition page on the JCA website listed tuition as $11,295 for the first student. \n \n\u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d Amy said. \u201cYou have good families that truly want Catholic education \u2013 like our family \u2013 and it\u2019s completely out of their means.\u201d \n \nBut Ann Hulbert, Ben\u2019s mother, said Ben received scholarships that helped tremendously with tuition costs. Ben said applying for them was \u201ca lot of work.\u201d He had to write essays and his parents had to submit financial forms. \n \n\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d Ben said. \u201cIt helped me","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DENISE M.

The play is about awareness and acceptance. I remember when I was growing up in Jamaica as a little girl I was buried in shame and embarrassment about every single solitary thing and when I became a teenager and in my early 20s, the bag of shame and guilt was getting a little heavy to walk up the mountain, so I had to get rid of it. \n \nOn unloading baggage through the play... \n \nIt tackles something that we don\u2019t talk about in Jamaica \u2014 sex. I think we should have more sexual education. We have ideas about how women should be, how women should act and a nice girl doesn\u2019t talk about sex. A nice girl shouldn\u2019t have sex, maybe we shouldn\u2019t even enjoy it. I don\u2019t know how we get all these children if nobody is having sex! I want to just make it okay for us to be comfortable with our sexuality. I want it to be okay to enjoy sex. I want it to be okay if we are molested, or something is happening to us that we don\u2019t like, we don\u2019t just walk away and go take it in the closet or hide it under the carpet, because things are never going to change if we don\u2019t vocalise everything. I want it be okay for people to know that it is okay that we go through these things. I have been through these things. The play is autobiographical; it is a true story. It is 98 per cent true, I have taken two per cent of poetic licence to turn it into a play, but I feel that I wouldn\u2019t change anything because it has made me into the person that I am. \n \nSet the scene for the tales that play out for the audience. \n \nIt begins with a young girl discovering the male organ for the first time and it goes all the way to the boom of sexual awakening with some unpleasant experiences along the way. To be honest, if I had to live it all over again, I wouldn\u2019t change anything because I believe that everything that happened to me, the good, the bad and the ugly, has made me into the person I am today \u2014 a very strong, a very proud Jamaican woman. \n \nWould it be shortchanging the play to call it your sexual odyssey? \n \nIt\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s not just my story; it\u2019s every woman\u2019s story. And I am talking about it because they can\u2019t talk about it. I am talking about it for them. And I think it is important because if we don\u2019t talk about these things, how are we going to get the younger generation of women to come and be strong and to feel empowered if the older women don\u2019t educate them? \n \nI thought it was very sad when a friend of mine who does social work in Jamaica told me 13-year-old girls are pregnant and they don\u2019t know how they got pregnant, so obviously they were molested, but they didn\u2019t even know that is what makes a baby. That is sad, and yet I think that Jamaican women are some of the strongest women in the world. But when it comes to that everybody just shies away. \n \nLet me be a tad cheeky and ask what was your favourite cock tale encounter. \n \nYou would have to come to the play and see it, but my favourite cock tale was that giant sexual boom that I had the first time. \n \nWhat is the status of \n \nJamaica Farewell \n \nsince it was optioned to be made into a film? \n \nUnfortunately, in Hollywood, some things take 10 years to make. We were trying to get Rihanna. They worked with Rihanna on a contract for a long time and it fell through. Rita Wilson got cancer. They lost a bit of the steam on it, but the other producers have it, and it will be on the screen probably in a couple of years. I have no doubt that story will get on the screen. Good stories will rise to the top. The film business is tough. \n \nForrest Gump that Tom Hanks did took 10 years to be made, but \n \nJamaica Farewell will get on the screen. I have the rights to the play and someone has the rights to the film. \n \nAnything else in the pipeline? \n \nI am tired of being on stage by myself. This is the fourth one-person I have written. I love to perform and I would love to be able to be in a production with other people now, so this will be my last solo production. If I write something else, it will be for other people because I am ready now to interact; I only did so that I could get work. I think I have proven myself. I can do the work, so I am ready to do productions that are not solo.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"SO Spotted \u2014 Debra Ehrhardt","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195442341","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You become familiar with each other, you get sick of that one dude who keeps elbowing you in the ribs, and it is easy for tensions to be high. The avenging team (the Suns in this case) almost always comes out hot for the next game, channeling their disdain for the previous loss. To no surprise, the Suns did just that in the first quarter, scoring 33 points with zero (!) turnovers. \n \nBut then, like most nights, the starters had to take a breather, and Brandon Knight and well, Alex Len took over from there. Phoenix\u2019s twelve point lead eventually evaporated thanks to some spirited work in the paint from Kenneth Faried and a classic bucket-getting half from Danilo Gallinari . \n \nBy the end of the half, the Suns were up 61-59, but the early momentum had been lost. \n \nSome assorted thoughts: \n The coaching staff made a conscious effort to feed T.J. Warren the rock in the first quarter, running the same action over and over to get him one step ahead of Gallinari. Returns on this venture were spotty, with Warren shooting a meager 2 for 6 on his shots in the first quarter. Regardless of the results, I enjoyed the ambition to involve Warren as the focus of the offense; sometimes it can be too easy to fall in love with the Eric Bledsoe and Devin Booker show.  There was a sequence in the first quarter (7:13 left I believe) where Bledsoe ran a pick-and-roll with Tyson Chandler , but rather than Chandler rolling to the basket, he set another screen to free up Booker near the free throw line, who had looped around from the baseline. Though seemingly minuscule, that is an interesting wrinkle to keep the defense on their toes while also pinning Booker in position to attack. The end result was a near and-1 from Booker. (I wish I could grab the clip to show you guys, but League Pass\u2019 blackout rules put a stop to that.)  One of my favorite things to do while watching the game in person is observing Bledsoe maneuver his way through a collision course of screens. Since he is able to juke the screener and stay in front of his man, the defense isn\u2019t forced to bend to its limit, forcing an offense to audible on the fly. Now, Bledsoe isn\u2019t able to do this every possession, but given his responsibility on offense, it is impressive he can summon the energy to do it at all.  Booker absolutely bullied Denver\u2019s guards in the post in the first half. It\u2019s easy to forget how young Book is because normally we associate pristine post play with veterans, but he knows how to get to his spot and strike accordingly. The Suns will wisely have Booker screen on Bledsoe\u2019s man at some points to facilitate a switch and allow him to feast on opposing point guards. What a weapon.  Early in the third quarter, Booker picked up his third foul and was subbed out for Brandon Knight. From then on, the offense struggled to keep pace with Denver, producing movement that didn\u2019t provide a pathway to scoring and a ton of disgruntled facial expressions. Poor Bledsoe had to take it upon himself to hoist inefficient jumpers late in the shot clock as a prayer. This was where the game was lost.  Thankfully, Leandro Barbosa came into the game to make it all better. (Kinda.)  It\u2019s hard to understand why this team does not play better together defensively. Whether it is due to a lack of focus, confusion about rotations, or other factors, the personnel does not match the production on the defensive end. I understand that younger teams tend to struggle on that end, but you would think that Chandler, Bledsoe, and P.J. Tucker would be able to cover up mistakes more often.  A loud portion of the fan base will relish in tonight\u2019s outcome, hoping it will spearhead a spiral down the standings towards a higher draft pick. Although I understand the logic, I have a hard time sharing that sentiment. Rooting for a team to lose is a weird place for a fan to be in when there are still months left in the season.

By 12.30am she had carted her seventh Daphne Akhurst trophy back outside, to squeeze in one last pose for the photographers.\n\nBy lunchtime on Sunday she was on her way home; the tennis circus doesn't pause for record holders or even let them get much sleep. \"I'm leaving,\" said Williams, asking if she would stick around for Federer v Nadal. \"Man, I got to watch that match.\"\n\nFans were ready for Williams to win her 23rd grand slam title, and break her tie with Steffi Graf. They had been ready for a while.\n\nSerena wore red and black Nike Jordan boots featuring the No. 23 for the post-match presentation (you can also buy them in pink), Berlei had a new ad ready to run on social media and straight after the match Williams signed a set of gold racquets made by Wilson, strung to her specifications and featuring a 24-carat trapdoor on the butt cap. On sale for $960, with all proceeds headed for her foundation. All 23 were sold online within minutes.\n\nNone of this is to say that Serena is done, or satisfied. Graf was 30 when she retired, fresh off her first grand slam finals in three years at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 1999, but with a hamstring injury and a lost love for the sport. Williams was 35 when she beat her older sister Venus on Saturday night, and plans to enjoy this one. \"It's a great number. I know she would like to have a little more,\" said Venus, while Serena conceded that it had sat somewhere at the back of her mind since she was 22.\n\n\"I guess after Wimbledon,\" said Williams, who went on to lose her US Open semi-final to Karolina Pliskova last year. Those Nikes had been sitting in a cupboard somewhere since. \"I obviously was thinking, 'OK, the next one.' I got it so fast, it didn't stay on the radar so long.\"\n\nSo is No. 24 \u2013 the Margaret Court pre-Open era record \u2013 just around the corner? \"No,\" said Williams. She hasn't forgotten: it took a year and three tough losses to creep from 21 up to 22. \"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax. If you win the French it's like back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next grand slam.\"\n\nWilliams met Court in Perth last year for a \"really interesting\" chat, but grew up watching Graf, Monica Seles, Pete Sampras and can remember feeling inspired as a nine-year-old by Zina Garrison's run to the Wimbledon final. Now she knows that she, Graf and Navratilova are \"hands down leading the conversation\" when it comes to talk about which player is the greatest of all time.\n\n\"Yeah, just one thing about a champion, they keep fighting, they keep going,\" she said. \"I just feel like those four really are incredible fighters. They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\"\n\nSo what's next. A \"Serena Slam\"? Nope. \"A Serena Slam doesn't start in Australia,\" Williams said. \"It starts any other Grand Slam outside of Australia.\"\n\nA regular 'slam? \"I don't think about that either.\" How about one of the best-ever sporting stories to tell? Venus can answer that one for her. \"I don't think we're going for the greatest story in sports,\" she said. \"We're just going for some dreams. In the case that we are, what an honour, what an honour.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Emma Quayle"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017: With title No.23 in the bag, Serena Williams packs hers and heads home","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"5253","state":"South Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Murray Bridge","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Murray Valley Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169916815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Murray Valley Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.murrayvalleystandard.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195445986","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:29:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/508d4b23-e743-4cb9-b31f-15b5660a912c.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Just because Trump has shown himself to be a bigot \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan called him \u201ctextbook racist,\u201d and having Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon in his cabinet supports this assessment \u2014 doe sn\u2019t automatically mean all his policies on immigration are misguided. Just as good people often do miserable things (FDR interned innocent Japanese-Americans during World War II), horrible people sometimes get things right. \n \nOur new president has been repeatedly compared to Hitler, but that\u2019s embarrassing hyperbole, and we need to dial down the hysteria. Mark Twain said, \u201cHistory does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme\u201d: Based on his mannerisms, facial tics and general demeanor, Trump is a lot closer to Mussolini \u2014 a much-less-horrible demagogue. \n \nThe good news was Mussolini made the trains run on time, revived Italy\u2019s economy and imprisoned the Mafia. The bad news was his bromance with Hitler and, of course, World War II, which ended somewhat miserably for the Italians. \n \nBad news from our 45th president is his bromance with Vladimir Putin (whom John McCain correctly labels \u201ca thug and a butcher\u201d). Russia\u2019s complicity in Trump\u2019s election has been affirmed by 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, but Trump\u2019s followers blindly rubber stamp his claim that the CIA, FBI, NSA, etc., are all wrong. The good news here is some suspicion of government is healthy. (We could\u2019ve used more of it during the run-up to Gulf War II.) The bad news is Americans no longer accept facts. \n \nFollowing a campaign of deceit and slander, Trump\u2019s inauguration has initiated a post-truth era, which his spokesmen are calling \u201calternative fact\u201d (aka \u201cfalsehood\u201d). It\u2019s already the worst of times for scientists, as the GOP courts conservative Christians, who reject settled science, such as the Big Bang and evolution, in favor of nonsensical biblical literalism, superstition and conspiracy theory. \n \nTrump has replaced the secretary of energy, a Ph.D. nuclear physicist from Stanford University , with Rick Perry . The DOE is responsible for atomic energy and our nuclear arsenal, and Perry has been called the leader for Texans \u201cwho consider George W. Bush too cerebral.\u201d And one of the few Democratic appointees is anti-vaxer Robert Kennedy Jr., who espouses discredited conspiracy theories (shared by Trump) linking vaccines to neurological disorders, such as autism. RFK, Jr. will chair a vaccine commission. \n \nMeanwhile, Scott Pruitt , named to head the EPA after years of suing the agency to block its clean-air and anti-water-pollution initiatives, is a climate change denier. Climate change is a scientific question. It\u2019s either true or it isn\u2019t; however, the verdict shouldn\u2019t be based on political ideology, but on the weight of the scientific data and the overwhelming number of scientists (97 percent) who support it. Sadly, in a post-truth era, NOAA and NASA take a back seat to Exxon, so oil company lobbyists now \u201cprotect\u201d the environment. \n \nTrump has named Steve Bannon of the racist, far-right and fact-averse Breitbart News Network as his chief strategist. While labeling CNN \u201cfake news,\u201d Trump confers with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , who\u2019s called the Newtown massacre a hoax and has \u201cexposed\u201d a CIA plot to assassinate President Trump. What\u2019s next, reopening the 9/11 Commission , so 9/11 Truther Charlie Sheen can claim W destroyed the Twin Towers? \n \nTrump maintained the lie that he\u2019d seen a video of thousands of Muslim-Americans celebrating 911 until his claim was \u201cvindicated\u201d by Breitbart (and nowhere else). For the adoring right-wing sycophants who reject non-alt-right media, this represents proof. In poker, it\u2019s called a \u201ccontinuation bet\u201d: You bluff, and, if everyone doesn\u2019t drop out, you keep making the same bet until they do. It works if no one is willing to call your bluff. \n \nIn our fact-free landscape, Trump can call an election in which he lost the popular vote by 3 million ballots a \u201clandslide victory.\u201d (Sadly, a post-truth culture also enables John Lewis to make the equally counterfactual claim that Trump\u2019s election was \u201cillegitimate.\u201d) \n \nTrump is now taking full advantage of this environment to double down on his own dishonesty. For example, he continues to insist that Mexico will pay for the wall \u201clater on.\u201d This is like Wimpy (\u201cI\u2019ll gladly pay you Friday for a hamburger today\u201d) in the old Popeye cartoons. \n \nIn one of the best Marx Brothers comedies \u2014 \u201cDuck Soup\u201d \u2014 Chico asked the question that\u2019s become the template for Trump\u2019s response to accusations of everything from lying, racism and misogyny to mocking the disabled, hiding one\u2019s tax returns and exaggerating the size of his crowds: \u201cWho ya gonna believe \u2014 me or your own lyin\u2019 eyes?\u201d \n \nThe bad news is not enough Americans are answering, \u201cI trust facts.\u201d The good news is ... well, I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait a little longer for some of that. \n \nGreenwich native Mark Drought (markdrought4@gmail.com) is an editor at a Stamford IT firm and was an adjunct English professor at the University of Connecticut-Stamford .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mark Drought"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Mark Drought: Good times, bad times","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fairfield","zipCode":"06904","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stamford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Stamford Advocate","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169689086","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"816"},"name":"Stamford Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stamfordadvocate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195449875","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The new clinic replaced a mobile clinic program which Americares launched in 2014 to meet the health care ... more  Photo: Michael Cummo / Hearst Connecticut Media 1  /  2 \n \nBack to Gallery \n   \nThis week we celebrated the opening of a spacious new medical clinic for the uninsured \u2014 a health center that will improve care for Stamford\u2019s most vulnerable. The Americares Free Clinic of Stamford is already bustling with low-income patients who have nowhere else to turn for help treating debilitating, life-threatening health problems. At 2,200-square feet with five exam rooms, the clinic was designed to give us room to grow. But with efforts underway in Washington to repeal the Affordable Care Act without consensus on a replacement, it could get uncomfortably crowded. \n \nAs a health-focused relief and development organization working to increase access to care, it is hard to remain silent when health care for the millions who gained coverage under the A.C.A. is at risk. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 18 million people could lose coverage within a year if the legislation is repealed. At Americares, we are particularly concerned about the lowest-wage earners and whether they will lose coverage in a transition to the yet-to-be decided replacement plan, disrupting their access to physicians, treatment and, ultimately, their ability to provide for their families. \n \nIn our 23 years of experience operating free clinics in the state, any reduction in Medicaid benefits brings patients to our doors. Even with the numbers of uninsured dropping to a record low and one of the most successful health care exchanges in the country, demand at our clinics increased over the past three years; patient visits went up 30 percent from 2013 to 2016. Medicaid funding cuts at the federal or state level would cause demand to skyrocket well beyond our current capacity. Our clinics in Stamford, Bridgeport, Danbury and Norwalk would all be affected. \n \nCuts to Medicaid programs in other states would also lead to a surge in demand for assistance from our partner clinics. Americares U.S. Program supports 1,000 safety net clinics in all 50 states with medicine, supplies, education and training. Demand for these resources is highest in states that did not expand Medicaid. Our U.S. Program shipped nearly $140 million in medical products to clinic partners in non-expansion states last year \u2014 more than twice the amount delivered to states that expanded access to Medicaid. \n \nAmericares won\u2019t be alone in feeling the strain. Hospitals, local governments and other social service providers will all shoulder the burden of the newly uninsured. The Urban Institute estimates that repeal without replacement would lead to the newly uninsured seeking an additional $1.1 trillion in uncompensated care between 2019 and 2028. There would be fallout in almost every sector: The George Washington University \u2019s school of public health projects 2.6 million jobs will be lost over the next two years if Medicaid or tax subsidies are cut. \n \nEconomics aside, this is an equality issue. There is an abundance of evidence that the poor die younger. A study last year from the Brookings Institution found as much as a 14-year difference in life expectancy between the top 10 percent of wage earners and the bottom 10 percent. \n \nThe A.C.A. is far from perfect \u2014 the lack of competition in some states and the high deductibles cause real pain for low-income families. We\u2019ve had patients purchase insurance only to return to our free clinics seeking care because they cannot afford the deductibles. The A.C.A. was crafted with provisions intended to address the needs of the poorest among us. As new legislation is introduced, the people with the least means should not be forgotten. \n \nAt Americares, we\u2019ve always promised to care for those affected by poverty.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2870","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Parkes","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Parkes Champion-Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351647708","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Parkes Champion-Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.parkeschampionpost.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195454276","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

She plans to retire at the end of this season after a career in which she was twice runner-up in mixed doubles finals with Mexican Santiago Gonzalez at the US Open in 2013 and 2014. \n\nThe triumph by Spears and 30-year-old Cabal continued the veteran's theme of the championships with 30-plus players in the men's and women's singles finals, too. \n\n--- \n\n3:15 p.m. \n\nThere was a lot of mutual respect going around before the Australian Open final on Sunday between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. \n\n\"Rafa's definitely presented me with the biggest challenge in the game,\" Federer said after his semifinal win over U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka. \"I'm happy we've had some epic, epic battles over the years ...\" \n\nNadal said neither player could have imagined making the final of the year's first Grand Slam after coming back from their respective injuries in 2016 \u2014 Federer, his left knee; Nadal, his left wrist.

Nadal has a 23-11 record overall and has won nine of their 11 Grand Slam matches. \n\nThe match was an early-evening start, expected under clear skies and in temperatures of about 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), allowing the roof on Rod Laver Arena to be open. \n\n--- \n\n2:55 p.m. \n\nA Grand Slam final nearly six years in the making is just hours away at the Australian Open. \n\nThe last time Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal met in a major final was at the French Open in 2011, when Nadal won in four sets. Nadal holds a 23-11 edge, including semifinal wins at the Australian Open in 2012 and 2014. \n\nFederer, with a leading 17 Grand Slam men's singles titles, has gone further in the tournament than he ever expected after being out for six months with a left knee injury. Nadal, too, spent extended injury time on the sidelines in 2016. \n\nThe mixed doubles final will open the action at Rod Laver, with American Abigail Spears and Juan Sebastian Cabal playing Sania Mirza of India and Ivan Dodig.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Spears and Cabal win Aussie mixed doubles title","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Manatee","zipCode":"34205","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bradenton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bradenton Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657775","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"626"},"name":"Bradenton Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bradenton.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195462316","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:42:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If we get 1 on 1, I\u2019m going your way so you\u2019d better win,\u201d\u2019 Webb said. \u201cAnd he did. He won multiple times.\u201d \n \nWebb spread the ball around to other receivers like Mississippi State\u2019s Fred Ross as well. The Pac-12 Conference\u2019s leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb. \n \nNate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in the showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina\u2019s Zay Jones with 1:51 left but the North went for two points and a potential lead. \n \nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga\u2019s Keionta Davis, Peterman\u2019s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU\u2019s Harvey Langi. The South ran out the clock from there. \n \nThe week was about auditioning for NFL teams, more than winning, but Peterman said he wanted that last completion \u201cvery bad.\u201d \n \n\u201cYou\u2019re always competitive,\u201d said Peterman, who was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and played most of the game. \u201cTo say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool. We didn\u2019t get it but it was a great experience still.\u201d \n \nWebb was the game\u2019s overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech. \n \nHe led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 \u2014 on a third-and-10 play \u2014 and 13 yards before the touchdown. \n \nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South\u2019s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. \n \n \nToledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays. \n \nThe South\u2019s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. \n \nThe South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Zenor The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Cal quarterback Davis Webb shines for South in Senior Bowl win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Bernardino","zipCode":"92401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Bernardino","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"San Bernardino County Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694193","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"824"},"name":"San Bernardino County Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sbsun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195462808","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.sbsun.com/storyimage/LG/20170128/SPORTS/170129365/AR/0/AR-170129365.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kesler drifted to his right, waited for Price to move with him and then slipped the puck between the goaltender\u2019s legs and into the back of the net. \n \nKesler fell to the ice, leaped to his skates and began pumping his arms in celebration. \n \nBedlam. \n \nWait, who in the heck is Ryker Kesler, you ask? \n \nWell, he is the 6-year-old son of Ryan Kesler, the Ducks\u2019 All-Star center, and he stole the show on the eve of the All-Star Game while wearing an enemy jersey on foreign ice, a place where Kings fans never hold back their feelings for their Southern California rivals. \n \nRyan Kesler planned to send Ryker in his place and it went better than either could have expected. Ryan Kesler was booed heavily when he was introduced before the event, reveling in it and blowing kisses to the crowd. Ryker got nothing but cheers from the fans, however. \n \n\u201cI was nervous,\u201d Ryan Kesler would later say. \u201cI was more nervous than him. \u2026 Amazing. It was pretty special. It was the perfect ending.\u201d \n \nAsked about Ryker\u2019s celebration, Ryan said, \u201cI think I taught you that, right?\u201d \n \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ryker said, smiling while standing with his dad in a crowded dressing room. \n \nThe Atlantic Division defeated the Keslers\u2019 Pacific Division in the shootout 4-1 and earned the right to pick its opponent for Sunday\u2019s 3-on-3 semifinal tournament. The Atlantic selected to play the Metropolitan in the second 20-minute semifinal. The defending champion Pacific will face the Central in the first semi. \n \nThe winners then face off in the third period. \n Hardest shot  \nMontreal Canadiens defenseman Shea Weber went into the event as the defending champion, winning on home ice last season while playing with the Nashville Predators. There was some that thought that he could break the all-time record of 108.8 mph by Boston Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara. \n \nWeber won, but he didn\u2019t come close to Chara\u2019s mark, posting a speed of 102.8 mph on a slap shot launched from a distance of 30 feet directly in front of the net. Winnipeg Jets rookie Patrik Laine was second with a speed of 101.7. Kings defenseman Drew Doughty\u2019s fastest shot was 94.6 mph. \n \nEach shooter had two attempts. \n \n\u201cThe first one, I felt like I hit good,\u201d Weber said. \u201cI thought it would be a little bit harder. I was saving more for the second shot because I was sitting around for two hours. I kind of wanted to work my way up. And then I missed the second one. I hit it too far behind the puck and kind of missed it.\u201d \n \n Skills challenge relay  \nThis timed relay event involved seven skaters and one goalie from each of the teams, and was probably the least well-received by an announced sellout crowd of more than 18,000. One-timed shooting, accuracy passing, puck control and stick-handling were the disciplines involved. \n \nThe Metropolitan Division, including Washington\u2019s Alexander Ovechkin and Pittsburgh\u2019s Sidney Crosby, posted a winning time of 1 minute, 21.70 seconds. The Atlantic was second in 1:39.69, the Central was third in 1:44.03 and the Pacific was fourth in 2:02.12. \n \nJoe Pavelski of the Sharks and Kesler scored on their first tries on their one-timers, getting the Pacific off to a good start. Jeff Carter of the Kings misfired on his first two tries before hitting the net and then Doughty struggled to find the mark in the passing portion. \n Faster skater  \nConnor McDavid\u2019s blinding speed pops up often in nightly highlight shows and Edmonton\u2019s 20-year-old star backed up the perception that he is the NHL\u2019s fastest skater as he had the quickest time out of the eight participants. \n \nMcDavid beat another fleet skater, Colorado\u2019s Nathan MacKinnon, in his head-to-head race as he covered the rink layout in 13.020 seconds to MacKinnon\u2019s 13.620. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s unbelievable fast,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cI was really nervous. I was a little worried. I thought he was going to fly. Definitely a great skater in his own way.\u201d \n \nSaid MacKinnon, joking he got caught sleeping: \u201cNot a bad guy to lose to.\u201d \n \nMcDavid\u2019s best time was better than the record of 13.172 seconds set by Detroit\u2019s Dylan Larkin last year. It won\u2019t be recognized as such because McDavid didn\u2019t do it in the full lap at the end after beating MacKinnon, with his final skate clocking in at 13.310. \n \nAlready, there was a \u201ccontroversy\u201d brewing because McDavid began from a full stop while Larkin was able to begin his start already in motion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019d be nice to see if you got a running start like last time,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cWould that shave off .2 seconds? I\u2019m not too sure.\u201d \n Four line challenge  \nMike Smith doesn\u2019t have All-Star numbers as the goalie for struggling Arizona. Smith is 11-13-5 with a 2.85 goals-against average and a .917 save percentage but he is in the game as the Coyotes\u2019 representative. \n \nAs one of the NHL\u2019s best handlers of the puck among netminders, Smith validated his appearance by shooting the puck the length of the ice from his own net into a tight opening at the opposing end. \n \n\u201cI knew it had a chance but I didn\u2019t know it was going to curl in like that,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think I was just as surprised as Bo Horvat was. Looking over at him was a pretty cool moment.\u201d \n \nSmith said he didn\u2019t put any extra English on his shot and that \u201cit was more fluke than anything.\u201d But the shot got a huge ovation at Staples Center, where he\u2019s normally a visiting goalie to be jeered. \n \n\u201cYeah, I got booed at the start and then they came around and cheered for me at the end,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m here for my goal scoring but it was a cool moment and probably one I\u2019ll cherish for a long time.\u201d \n Accuracy shooting  \nToronto\u2019s Auston Matthews showed off his skills by clearly hitting the four targets on each corner of the net in five tries but Pittsburgh star Sidney Crosby would better him by doing it faster in 10.730 seconds to 12.280 seconds. \n \n\u201cHe made me look bad there,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI was feeling good about myself after and then he goes and does that. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the best player in the world.\u201d \n \nMatthews said he got pinpoint passes from Ottawa\u2019s Erik Karksson on his one-time shots but found the event more challenging than it originally looked. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s smaller than it seems,\u201d Matthews said of the targets. \u201cIt\u2019s tough just going right into it, not really warming up or anything. Of course, you\u2019re pretty nervous beforehand anyways. I think I tuned it pretty well.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kid Kesler steals the show at the NHL All-Star Skills Competition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Bernardino","zipCode":"92373","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Redlands","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Redlands Daily Facts","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681040","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Redlands Daily Facts","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195467428","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And then his god-given talent can become a lot better.\"\n\nGilbert's been a successful coach, having helped Andre Agassis win six of eight major titles.\n\nHe led Andy Roddick to his 2003 US Open triumph and also worked with current No.1 Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he'd been keen to work with the 21-year-old, Gilbert didn't rule it out.\n\n\"I've never spent time with him, so that would be the first thing ... you never say never about anything, you never know,\" he said.\n\nStubbs, who won four grand slam doubles titles during her career, said because Kyrgios was a \"special person\" he was the only one who could decide on who his coach should be.\n\nKyrgios has been linked with Roger Rasheed, Lleyton Hewitt and Radek Stepanek, although the latter is still playing.\n\nBut Stubbs felt the decision he was facing was much more than just whether to get a coach and if so who, but just how good he wanted to be.\n\nIf he wanted to be great, like the Australian Open men's singles finalists Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then it was up to him.\n\n\"He's a special person. He will have to make this decision on his own,\" Stubbs said.\n\n\"It's kind of like when someone's an alcoholic, at some point your family and friends around you are saying you've got to stop drinking, but at some point you're the one that has to make the decision to do it.\n\n\"And he has to make the decision in himself that he wants to be great and it's hard being a great tennis player.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Polkinghorne"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Brad Gilbert says Nick Kyrgios can be world No.1 - if he gets a coach","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"5253","state":"South Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Murray Bridge","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Murray Valley Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169916815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Murray Valley Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.murrayvalleystandard.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195470521","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/77838a16-4f05-43de-99aa-48e88bb5f664.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It also provides a methodology to identify, map and ultimately repair neural circuits associated with other brain diseases. Credit: iStock / D3Damon \n\nIf a piece of electronics isn't working, troubleshooting the problem often involves probing the flow of electricity through the various components of the circuit to locate any faulty parts. \n\nStanford bioengineer and neuroscientist Jin Hyung Lee, who studies Parkinson's disease, has adapted that idea to diseases of the brain, creating a new way to turn on specific types of neurons in order to observe how this affects the whole brain. The work is described in the Jan. 26 issue of Neuron. \n\nLee, who trained as an electrical engineer before becoming a brain researcher, wanted to give neuroscientists a way to probe brain ailments similar to how engineers troubleshoot faulty electronics. \n\n\"Electrical engineers try to figure out how individual components affect the overall circuit to guide repairs,\" Lee said. \n\nIn the short term, her technique should help improve treatments for Parkinson's disease. In the long run it provides a methodology to identify, map and ultimately repair neural circuits associated with other brain diseases. \n\nSeeing the circuit \n\nLee's circuit-mapping approach combines two experimental tools with a computational method. The first experimental tool is optogenetics. Pioneered by Stanford bioengineer Karl Deisseroth, optogenetics modifies specific types of neurons \u2013 the basic working parts of the brain \u2013 so they can be turned on in response to light. The second experimental tool is called functional MRI, or fMRI, which measures blood flow in the brain. Increased blood flow is associated with increased activity. Using optogenetics to turn on a specific type of neuron, and fMRI to observe how other regions of the brain responded, Lee then used a computational analysis to map the entire, specific neural circuit and also determine its function. \n\nControlling Parkinson's tremors \n\nOne hallmark of Parkinson's disease are uncontrollable tremors. Neuroscientists believe that these tremors are caused by malfunctions in the neural pathways that control motion. They know that different regions of the brain are constantly forming circuits to carry out tasks, whether motion or speech. However, prior to Lee's technique, researchers had no way to show how activating a specific type of neuron might cause a specific circuit to form in the whole brain. \n\nTesting her approach on rats, Lee probed two different types of neurons known to be involved in Parkinson's disease \u2013 although it wasn't known exactly how. Her team found that one type of neuron activated a pathway that called for greater motion while the other activated a signal for less motion. Lee's team then designed a computational approach to draw circuit diagrams that underlie these neuron-specific brain circuit functions. \n\n\"This is the first time anyone has shown how different neuron types form distinct whole brain circuits with opposite outcomes,\" Lee said. \n\nLee said the findings in this paper should help to improve treatments for Parkinson's disease. Neurosurgeons are already using a technique called deep brain stimulation (DBS) to calm Parkinson's tremors in their patients. DBS delivers tiny electric jolts to neurons thought to be responsible for the tremors. A more precise understanding of the how those neurons work to control motion could help guide more effective stimulation. \n\nBut more broadly speaking, Lee thinks that her technique \u2013 optogenetic fMRI combined with computational modeling \u2013 gives researchers a new way to reverse-engineer the functions of the many different types of neurons in the brain and the bafflingly diverse array of neural circuits formed to carry out different commands. \n\nMore information: David Bernal-Casas et al.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2580","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Goulburn","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Town & Country Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169772701","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Town & Country Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.townandcountrymagazine.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195478372","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2580","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Goulburn","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Town & Country Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169772701","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Town & Country Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.townandcountrymagazine.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195481743","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He was quite social on his table that he was sitting at apparently. I think he was just very glad of that and the other few occasions when we would invite him to family parties,\u201d Mr Dias said. \n \nMr Dias said they were neighbours from the 1980s until Mr Lytton moved to Pakistan in 2005, without warning. \n \nNeighbours say he was a tube driver, and at one stage perhaps worked as a taxi driver and even a casino croupier. \n \nMr Lytton was found on the morning of 12 December 2015, fully clothed and facing the summit of Indian\u2019s Head, a prominent feature above Dovestone Reservoir on Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District. \n \nPolice discovered he had travelled to the UK from Lahore, Pakistan, two days before his death. \n \nThree train tickets and £130 in cash were found on his body, but he had no wallet, ID or phone. \n \nOn the day before his body was found, he was seen on CCTV pacing outside London\u2019s Ealing Broadway station. He was later seen at London\u2019s Euston station. \n \nHe then travelled by train from London to Manchester, where he entered a pub in Greenfield and asked for directions to the 1,500ft summit. \n \n \n Image Caption: \n Mr Lytton seen on CCTV in the day\u2019s leading up to his death \n   \nHe had been warned not to attempt the walk so late in the day but set off anyway. Witnesses saw him on the track at dusk that evening. \n \nFollowing his death, toxicology reports showed Mr Lytton had been killed by strychnine, which is found in rat poison. Police say he poisoned himself. \n \nNumerous theories about his identity were raised as the police investigation continued. \n \nIt wasn\u2019t until a leg implant was traced back to Lahore where the surgery had been carried out and his identity was discovered. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve found the whole thing very sad,\u201d Mr Dias said. \u201cI think he was a very lonely person with only a few regular visitors. When he left we have no recollection of him saying goodbye to us. I would go as far to use the word recluse. He would keep himself to himself but was always a very pleasant person.\u201d \n \nA full inquest will take place on 14 March. \n \nArticle source: http://news.sky.com/story/mans-death-on-saddleworth-moor-remains-a-mystery-10747191 \n\nThe post appeared first on Dee 1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Pakistan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Saddleworth Moor victim was \u2018a lonely character\u2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Cheshire","zipCode":"CH1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Chester","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Dee 106.3","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"593787296","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Dee 106.3","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dee1063.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://news.sky.com/story/mans-death-on-saddleworth-moor-remains-a-mystery-10747191"],"sequenceId":"695195488345","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:03:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A recent study demonstrated increased cerebral vasoconstriction in the large arteries on the brain surface (pial arteries) after global cerebral ischaemia. However, smaller arterioles inside the brain (parenchymal arterioles) are equally important in the regulation of cerebral blood flow and yet their pathophysiology after global cerebral ischaemia is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether increased contractility occurs in the intraparenchymal arterioles. \n Methods  \nGlobal cerebral ischaemia was induced in male Wistar rats by bilateral common carotid occlusion for 15 min combined with hypovolaemia. Regional cerebral blood flow was determined by quantitative autoradiography. Intraparenchymal arterioles were isolated and pressurized, and concentration\u2013response curves to endothelin-1 with and without the endothelin B receptor-selective antagonist BQ788 was generated. Endothelin B receptor expression was investigated by quantitative flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. \n Results  \nWe observed increased endothelin-1-mediated contractility of parenchymal arterioles correlating with reduced cerebral blood flow of the cortex, hippocampus and caudate nucleus 48 h after global cerebral ischaemia. The increased endothelin-1-mediated contractility was abolished by BQ788, and the vascular smooth muscle cell-specific expression of endothelin B receptors was significantly increased after global cerebral ischaemia. \n Conclusion  \nIncreased endothelin-1-mediated contractility and expression of endothelin B receptors in the intraparenchymal vasculature contributes to the development of delayed cerebral hypoperfusion after global cerebral ischaemia in combination with vascular changes of the pial vasculature.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"S.

They\u2019re co-ordinating with private attorneys and firms that have volunteered to help. They\u2019re reviewing statutes, setting priorities and seeking donations. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all-out war,\u201d said Vermont Law School Professor Patrick Parenteau. \u201cIf you\u2019re an environmentalist or conservationist, this is indeed a scary time.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s first week in office only heightened their anxieties. He moved to resume construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines that the Obama administration had halted, while signalling intentions to abandon his predecessor\u2019s fight against global warming, vastly expand oil and gas drilling on public lands and slash the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget. \n \nGOP lawmakers, meanwhile, introduced measures to overturn a new Interior Department rule barring coal mining companies from damaging streams and to remove some wolves from the endangered species list. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019ve wasted no time in doing bad things,\u201d said Pat Gallagher, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s 50-member legal team, which he said is likely to grow as environmentalists increasingly regard the courts as their best option, even though success there is far from certain. \n \nThe Department of Justice, which represents the federal government in environmental lawsuits, declined to comment, while the White House did not respond to emails seeking comment. Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team at EPA, said of the environmentalists that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure what they think they\u2019re preparing for\u201d but suspects they are stoking fear of Trump as a fundraising tool. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about raising money than protecting the environment,\u201d Ericksen said. \n \nJim Burling, litigation director for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a non-profit property rights group that sues regulators on behalf of businesses and landowners, also contended environmental groups were exaggerating the Trump administration\u2019s threat for political and financial gain. \n \nThe government bureaucracy is entrenched, Burling said, and, \u201cwho happens to occupy the White House hasn\u2019t made that much difference.\u201d \n \nEnvironmentalists say their fears are justified by the new administration\u2019s antagonism toward government\u2019s role in keeping air and water clean and the planet from overheating. \n \nDonations began increasing after Trump\u2019s election, \u201ceven before the fundraising letters were sent\u201d asking for support to fight the administration\u2019s actions, said David Goldston, government affairs director at the Natural Resources Defence Council. \n \nEarthjustice, which has represented the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in its fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, has about 100 staff attorneys and plans to bring more aboard, said Tim Preso, who manages the group\u2019s Northern Rockies office. \n \nThe Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center is adding four attorneys to its pre-election staff of 18 and is co-ordinating with more than a dozen outside attorneys who would file citizen suits against polluters for free if agencies fail to enforce existing rules, said Executive Director Howard Learner. \n \n\u201cWe cannot fully substitute and replace the EPA doing its job,\u201d Learner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we\u2019re not going to default to zero if the EPA steps backward when it comes to clean air and clean water enforcement.\u201d \n \nOn inauguration eve, five law professors filed a brief in support of a 2015 regulation giving EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers discretion to regulate tributaries and wetlands far upstream from navigable lakes and rivers to protect water quality. \n \nDozens of states have sued to block the rule \u2014 including Oklahoma, led by state Attorney General Scott Pruitt, now Trump\u2019s choice for EPA administrator \u2014 saying it gives government too much power over private property. \n \nShortly after Trump took office, his White House webpage listed the rule among \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\u201d he would target. \n \n\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t defend the rule, I want to stand alongside environmental groups and do what I can to defend (it),\u201d said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former Justice Department prosecutor, who helped file the brief. \n \nGoing to court is just one tactic environmental lawyers will use, said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center, which also plans new hires. They will monitor agencies for failure to enforce pollution law or cutting corners when writing permits for activities such as oil and gas drilling, he said. \n \nThe Sierra Club\u2019s Gallagher, who sued over oil drilling beneath national parks during the George W. Bush administration, said another tactic would be making liberal use of open-records laws to obtain scientific data and other materials that might otherwise be purged. The group already has requested records on climate change from the EPA. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised at what they\u2019re doing, but maybe a little surprised at how fast and furious it\u2019s all happening,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cBut we were bracing for it and we\u2019re ready.\u201d \n \n___ \n \nFlesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan. \n \n___ \n \nFollow Webber and Flesher on Twitter: https://twitter.com/twebber02, https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Environmentalists preparing to battle Trump, GOP in court","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"K1G","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Ottawa","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"1310 NEWS","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608957272","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"1310 NEWS","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.1310news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/twebber02","https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher"],"sequenceId":"695195491213","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They were using peoples\u2019 yards as their personal pantry for caching their kills. \n   \n\u201cWhat made this situation unusual wasn\u2019t that we had mountain lions coming down into the foothills, because we\u2019ve had this going on for a number of years,\u201d said Jennifer Jackson, regional conservation educator for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. \u201cWhat was unusual was this mother mountain lion had multiple kittens with her and they were truly setting up a household.\u201d \n    \nStory continues below video \n    \n× \n \n   \nJackson added that these caching behaviors are much different than the animals simply traveling through. And because of these factors, removing and transporting the female and her other three kittens to suitable and more remote habitat occurred on the afternoon of Jan. 20. \n   \n\u201cWe wanted to put her in a place where she could still take care of her kids but not be in any conflicts with people,\u201d Jackson said. \n   \nHowever, Fish and Game received a report on Jan. 25, that a mountain lion kitten was spotted in the same area of the previous captures. It was apparent that this kitten was part of the same family, so attempts were made to capture the young cat using a hound and dog handler. \n   \nIt was successfully treed by Wednesday afternoon, but not in a location that allowed for safe retrieval. \n   \nThe risks to the kitten and staff were too great. \n   \nBy 8 p.m. that evening, the kitten was still treed when Fish and Game personnel placed parts of a road-killed deer down the hill from the tree. Personnel hoped that when the kitten came down during the night, it would stop to feed and then leave tracks for Fish and Game to follow. \n   \nThe little mountain lion cub did just that. \n   \nThe next morning, Fish and Game, with help from the hound and dog handler, tracked the paw prints left in the snow from the food site to the original residence where the mountain lion family was first observed the week before. \n   \nThe kitten was sheltered under the same part of the home\u2019s deck where its mom and siblings had been at one time. A catch pole was used to remove the kitten from under the deck before placing it in a crate. \n   \nFish and Game intends to reunite the lost kitten with its family, as soon as their locations are pinpointed. The mother cat is wearing a radio collar, but Fish and Game has not received a recent signal. \n   \n\u201cThe kitten\u2019s best chance of survival is to release it as close to mom as possible,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt would be difficult for the young cat to live on its own and feed itself with the kind of harsh winter we are having.\u201d \n   \nJackson added that it\u2019s likely the animals ended up where they did because mountain lions and other predatory animals follow their food. \n   \n\u201cIn the wintertime, deer move down to escape deep snow or colder temperatures so it only makes sense that their predators will also move down,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep in mind, though, we always have an urban population of deer living in the Johnny Creek area. That\u2019s one reason why we ask people to please not feed the deer that live in their backyards. Not only do they not need it, but you can also create a situation where you can draw predators down into the neighborhood.\u201d \n   \nThis year in particular, with Pocatello\u2019s deep snow and the extreme weather, Jackson said people are certainly going to see more of the wild deer, elk and other animals moving down, and with them come the predators. \n   \nMountain lions are usually very secretive and wary and their usual response around people or a perceived danger is to run. If they have kittens, they often stash them, and then take off to draw the danger away from their young, according to Jackson. \n   \n\u201cAttacks on humans by mountain lions are very rare,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we aren\u2019t aware of any attacks from mountain lions on humans that are of a defensive nature \u2014 whereas we certainly can cite several examples of attacks by bears and moose defending young. That being said, it makes sense that if a mother mountain lion was cornered with her young with no escape route she might attack.\u201d \n   \nShe continued, \u201cAs a reminder, this mother cat was behaving just as a mountain lion should. Her behavior was not abnormal. She was hunting deer, caching her kills and taking care of her kittens, but doing so right on top of people. It is for that reason she was moved with her kittens to a more suitable and more remote habitat.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Shelbie Harris sharris@journalnet.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Fifth cougar captured, will soon be reunited with family","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bannock","zipCode":"83204","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pocatello","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho State Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"473"},"name":"Idaho State Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatejournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195494545","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:43:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Its full significance has now become apparent. \n \nThe find contained a mixture of extremely rare Anglo-Saxon coins and Viking silver, which provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex and his less well-known contemporary Ceolwulf II of Mercia. \n \nSome of the coins were minted with a \u2018Two Emperors\u2019 design, borrowed from the Romans, which shows that the currency was used in both ancient kingdoms. \n \n \n Image Caption: \n The find has shed light on an alliance made in the 870s between Alfred the Great (pictured) and Ceolwulf \n   \n\u201cThis is an extraordinary find, one which re-writes Anglo-Saxon history,\u201d Xa Sturgis, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which now houses the coins, told Sky News. \n \n\u201cThe keeper of the coin room here came running up the stairs to tell me. The more they were excavated the more it became obvious how significant they are. These coins point to some sort of an alliance in the 870s between Alfred and Ceolwulf.\u201d \n \nWhile Alfred is often described as the king who founded England, uniting Mercia and Wessex, very little is known of his rival Ceolwulf. \n \n\u201cThese coins prove that there was a very real alliance between the two men at that time,\u201d added Julian Baker, coin curator at the Ashmolean. \n \n\u201cThat alliance hasn\u2019t survived in the historical record until now. Alfred manipulated history to put himself in a better light. To date, history has overemphasised Alfred\u2019s record and almost completely neglected Ceolwulf. \n \n\u201cWe can start re-writing that decade now, courtesy of the Watlington hoard.\u201d \n \n \n Image Caption: \n The haul was found in a field in Oxfordshire \n   \nThe Ashmolean has until Monday, 31 January, to raise £1.35m to keep the coins and Viking silver in Oxfordshire and they are extremely close to that figure now. \n \nMore than 500 people in the local area have donated to the fund set up to raise the cash. \n \nMr Sturgis added: \u201cAlfred is the only king in the history of England described as \u2018great\u2019. But these coins show that in the 870s he needed Ceolwulf. It\u2019s incredible that we know so little about him and Alfred dominates everything. It\u2019s like he obliterated Ceolwulf.\u201d \n \nThe Watlington Hoard, as it is now known, is on public display at the Ashmolean as historians begin the process of re-assessing that period of Anglo-Saxon history. \n \nArticle source: http://news.sky.com/story/coins-discovery-will-re-write-anglo-saxon-history-10747167 \n\nThe post appeared first on Dee 1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Coins discovery \u2018will re-write\u2019 Anglo-Saxon history","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Cheshire","zipCode":"CH1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Chester","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Dee 106.3","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"593787296","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Dee 106.3","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dee1063.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://news.sky.com/story/coins-discovery-will-re-write-anglo-saxon-history-10747167"],"sequenceId":"695195501723","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:03:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. \n \nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. \n \n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail. \n \nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. \n \n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. \n \nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n \nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect. \n \n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Tait)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"States discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals.\n\nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court.\n\n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail.\n\nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort.\n\n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro.\n\nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue.\n\nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Tait)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"States discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3689","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wodonga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Albury Border Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169682320","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"76"},"name":"Albury Border Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bordermail.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195529715","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3689","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wodonga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Albury Border Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169682320","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"76"},"name":"Albury Border Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bordermail.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195530275","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Since 2012, pulses of picosecond lasers (PSLs) have been available for tattoo removal. Based on a few observational studies, the claim has been made that PSLs are considerably more effective while showing fewer side-effects in comparison with NSLs. \n Objectives  \nTo compare the efficacy and side-effects of a PSL side by side with an NSL for tattoo removal. \n Methods  \nTwenty-one patients with 30 black tattoos were treated with PSL and NSL in a split-study design in two sessions at intervals of 6 weeks. The safety and efficacy of laser treatments were determined by blinded observers assessing randomized digital photographs in this prospective clinical study. The primary end point was the clearance of the tattoos ranging in quartiles from 0% to 100%; secondary end points were side-effects and pain. \n Results  \nThe average clearance overall as evaluated showed no statistical difference between NSL and PSL ( P = 1·00). Using a visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain), a value of 3·8 ± 1·0 was reported for the PSL, which was statistically different from NSL (7·9 ± 1·1, P < 0·001). Transient side-effects were observed, as well as hypo- and hyperpigmentation, but there was no statistically significant difference between PSL and NSL. \n Conclusions  \nAfter two treatments of black tattoos with a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser (1064 nm), the use of picosecond pulses does not provide better clearance than nanosecond pulses. However, pain is less severe when using a PSL.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"F. Pinto, S. Große-Büning, S. Karsai, C. Weiß, W. Bäumler, S. Hammes, M. Felcht, C.

To assess the role of skin IDO in immunity, the ability of isolated epidermal cells to metabolize tryptophan and the influence on polyclonal T cell mitogen (PHA)-stimulated T cell proliferation were explored. \n Results  \nIDO median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CA patients were similar to those from healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry showed that IDO(+) cells were rare in normal skin and the control skin of CA patients but were greatly accumulated in wart tissue. Most fluorescence signals of IDO(+) cells were not overlapping with those of CD1a(+) Langerhans cells (LCs). HPV DNA probe in situ hybridization showed a large number of IDO(+) cells in the HPV(-) site. Keratinocytes (KCs) in the skin of healthy subjects and the circumcised skin of CA patients could minimally transform tryptophan into kynurenine, but IDO-competent epidermal cells from warts could transform tryptophan. In addition, these IDO-competent epidermal cells could inhibit PHA-stimulated T cell proliferation. The addition of an IDO inhibitor 1-MT restored the inhibited T cell proliferation. \n Conclusion  \nAbnormally localized high IDO expression might be involved in the formation of a local immune tolerant microenvironment. \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.

Recent studies distinguished an indolent (early-stage FMF) and a more aggressive (advanced-stage FMF) subgroup. The optimal treatment for both subgroups needs still to be defined. \n Objectives  \nEvaluation of initial treatment results in patients with early- and advanced-stage FMF. \n Methods  \n203 Patients (84 early-stage, 102 advanced-stage, 17 extracutaneous FMF), included in the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Registry between 1985 and 2014 were studied. Type and results of initial treatment were retrieved from the Dutch Registry. Main outcomes were complete remission (CR), sustained complete remission (SCR), partial remission (>50% improvement; PR) and overall response (OR; CR+PR). \n Results  \nPatients with early-stage FMF were treated with non-aggressive SDTs in 67 of 84 cases, resulting in CR and OR of 28% and 83% for monotherapy topical steroids, 0% and 83% for UVB and 30% and 88% for PUVA, respectively. In patients with advanced-stage FMF these SDTs were less effective (combined CR and OR: 10% and 52%, respectively). In patients with advanced-stage FMF local radiotherapy (CR 63%; OR: 100%), total skin electron beam irradiation (CR: 59%; OR: 100%) and PUVA combined with local radiotherapy (CR: 5%; OR: 75%) were most effective. \n Conclusions  \nThe results of the present study demonstrate that not all patients with FMF should be treated aggressively. Patients with early-stage FMF may benefit very well from standard SDTs also used in early-stage classic MF and have an excellent prognosis. \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.

It offers protection against mechanical trauma due to the reversible deformation of its structure; these biomechanical properties are amenable to dynamic testing using non-invasive devices. \n Objectives \nTo characterise the biomechanical properties of young, white Caucasian and black African/African-Caribbean skin from different anatomical sites; and to relate underlying skin architecture to biomechanical function. \n Methods \nUsing cutometry and ballistometry, the biomechanical properties of buttock and dorsal forearm skin were determined in black African/African-Caribbean (n=18) and white Caucasian (n=20) individuals aged 18-30 years. Skin biopsies were obtained from a subset of the volunteers (black African/African-Caribbean: n=5; white Caucasian: n=6) and processed for histological and immunohistochemical detection of the major elastic fibre components and fibrillar collagens. \n Results \nWe have determined that healthy skin from young African and Caucasian individuals has similar biomechanical properties (F3) in that skin is resilient (capable of returning to its original position following deformation; R1), exhibits minimal fatigue (R4) and is highly elastic (R2, R5 and R7). At the histological level, skin with these biomechanical properties is imbued with strong interdigitation of the rete ridges at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and candelabra-like arrays of elastic fibres throughout the papillary dermis. Dramatic disruption to this highly organised arrangement of elastic fibres, effacement of the rete ridges and alterations to the alignment of the fibrillar collagens is apparent in white Caucasian forearm and coincides with a marked decline in biomechanical function. \n Conclusions \nMaintenance of skin architecture \u2013 both epidermal morphology and elastic fibre arrangement \u2013 is essential for optimal skin biomechanical properties. Disruption to underlying skin architecture, as observed in young white Caucasian forearm, compromises biomechanical function.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"A.K. Langton, H.K.

Common cutaneous adverse side effects of PD-1 inhibitors include maculopapular rash, pruritus, vitiligo, and lichenoid skin and mucosal reactions. Here, we describe a man in his sixties with metastatic melanoma treated with pembrolizumab who subsequently developed fading or disappearance of pigmented skin lesions, lightening of the skin, and poliosis of the eyebrows, eyelashes, and scalp and body hair. Compared to baseline high-resolution three-dimensional total body photography, we observed fading or disappearing of solar lentigines, seborrheic keratoses, and melanocytic naevi, suggesting that PD-1 inhibitors may affect the evolution of these benign skin lesions. With dermatoscopic follow-up, altered lesions showed either blue-grey peppering/granularity or fading in colour without other identifiable features. No halo lesions or lesions with surrounding inflammation were identified. One changed pigmented lesion that showed blue-grey peppering/granularity on dermoscopy was biopsied and interpreted as a macular seborrheic keratosis with melanophages. Further studies are required to elucidate the effects of PD-1 inhibition on benign skin lesions. \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.

We identified 14 240 neonates with, and 1 930 564 without haemangioma before discharge, and determined whether early- or late-onset pre-eclampsia was documented on the maternal chart. We used log-binomial regression to compute prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between pre-eclampsia and infantile haemangioma, adjusted for maternal characteristics. \n Results  \nThe prevalence of any haemangioma was higher for pre-eclampsia than for no pre-eclampsia (81·3 vs. 72·9 per 10 000), with a PR of 1·15 (95% CI 1·06\u20131·25) after adjustment for maternal characteristics. Pre-eclampsia with onset before 34 weeks\u2019 gestation was associated with cutaneous (PR 2·32, 95% CI 1·68\u20133·21), noncutaneous (PR 3·66, 95% CI 2·49\u20135·37) and unspecified haemangioma (PR 2·49, 95% CI 1·77\u20133·49). However, the association between early-onset pre-eclampsia and haemangioma was attenuated once long neonatal length of hospital stays was accounted for. There was no association with late-onset pre-eclampsia after 34 weeks, and associations were weaker for other variants including severe pre-eclampsia and pre-eclampsia with low birthweight. \n Conclusions  \nEarly-onset pre-eclampsia is associated with increased risk of haemangioma at birth, but detection bias due to longer hospital stays and closer follow-up may be part of the reason.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"N.

Instead, he said that they should let their teeth \u201cdrop naturally\u201d and that by the time they were a 100 years old, their teeth would have regrown.  \n \nWhen one of the commune members, Sian Davies, became pregnant with Katy, Balakrishnan told them that the reason her belly was growing larger was due to gas.  \n \nWhen Katy was born, he did not reveal who the father was and discouraged his followers from cuddling or caressing the infant even though they were all raising Katy collectively.  \n \nLater, when Katy was four years old, Siti Aishah explained how the toddler was \u201cdenounced\u201d when she wet herself.  \n  © Provided by The Star Online  \n\u201cI was so angry about it, I really felt like running out of the house at that time but I didn\u2019t,\u201d Siti Aishah said, explaining that she did not leave because she had no money or friends and feared being deported.  \n \nShe only left the commune when the police arrived following Katy\u2019s escape with the help of a sect member and a non-governmental organisation.  \n \nHowever, despite the confinement and even the physical abuse she suffered, Siti Aishah said she was happy living in the commune.  \n \n\u201cI thought every day was very interesting and I was never, ever bored.

Small tribal groups make up the remainder. \n \nMeanwhile, Malone said the Iban people were a \u201crelatively compliant group\u201d that went along with government policies.

Not all inventions have been practical or appreciated in their own times but they have certainly changed the way we live now one way or another. Ranging from fire and wheel to the most complicated space stuff, almost all inventions play important roles in our everyday lives. However, by the advancement of science the inventions have become more convoluted and in order to devise a practical instrument one usually needs some certain and relevant level of expertise and a team who would be able to help with different aspects of the project. \n \nSoroush Barmooz, a young inventor who holds a master\u2019s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), has designed hysteroscopic surgical instrument to treat different types of benign uterine tumors, fibroids in women with a minimally invasive technique. \n \nBarmooz, 28 from Mahabad, a city in the northwestern province of West Azarbaijan, believes his invention could help treat those benign uterine tumors with least side-effects possible, avoiding possible complications which may occur during or after the invasive procedures and help the patients live a normal life afterwards without worrying for adverse and undesirable effects a major surgery might cause. Aside from the surgical improvements Barmooz\u2019s invention would bring about, it can help eliminate the social and psychological problems which may arise from the disease, namely infertility and hysterectomy. In an exclusive interview to the Tehran Times, Barmooz has explained his path through his groundbreaking invention. \n \nPlease explain your invention. \n \nWe have developed four surgical instruments for treating uterine fibroids by minimally invasive myolysis (dissolution or liquefaction of muscular tissue) techniques. The idea of developing such instruments stems from my MSc thesis which I defended in February 2014. As a part of the thesis was to design a surgical hysteroscopic instrument for treating submucosal uterine fibroid (fibroids develop just under the lining of the uterine cavity). Mustafa Rostami, lecturer in Amirkabir University of Technology and Farah Farzaneh, of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences helped me through the project as well. [Hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to look inside the uterus in order to diagnose and treat causes of abnormal bleeding.] The instrument is ergonomically compatible to the female reproductive system and the surgeon\u2019s hands comprising multiple mechanisms each playing a special role to satisfy the requirements of the hysteroscopic operation. \n \nThe main mechanisms are a set of surgical electrodes which are anchored inside the fibroid for coagulation. Electricity is applied to the needles and delivered to the fibroid tissue and a subsequent necrosis (death of the cells) will occur.  The applied radio frequency (RF) electricity causes a tissue heating up, which leads to a perfect necrosis and subsequently death of the tumor, and eventually leads to a shrinkage in the size of the fibroid. Based on the reports in literature, it might be up to 90 per cent after 6 months. \n \nThe necrosis also eliminates chances of tumor relapse in the future. The instrument does not affect the surrounding myometrium and the overlaying endometrium thanks to the specially designed stem insulated electrodes; contrary to old methods, it causes no damages to the uterus and any future pregnancy would be totally harmless. All the instruments are registered in the Iran Intellectual Property Office and United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). \n \nHave the instruments proved to be effective so far? \n \nThe myolysis technique is an approved method which has been under research from late 1980s up to now. Specialists are still developing the method in many universities in the world. The method has been approved by many scientists by running numerous clinical tests. The invention comprises special tools for easing and accelerating myolysis procedure. Currently, myolisis is treated by laparotomy and endoscopic techniques. However, there are some reports indicating that performing that technique by trans-cervically and trans-endometrially methods but as far as I have investigated, these methods are not popular yet, but definitely they will become the best fitting alternative for both the laparoscopic and the laparotomy methods. \n \nAre there any similar invention in other parts of the world? \n \nThere are some reports indicating the use of trans-cervical and trans-endometrial methods; but as far as I know, those methods are not popular yet; nor are there any similar instruments in the market. In the best scenario, we are competing against the most up-to-date researches and anybody who gets to the finish line first will become the winner! We hope to be able to raise adequate fund as soon as possible before it becomes too late. The instruments are unique because there are not any similar ones abroad or in Iran. \n \nYou have registered your inventions at United States Patent and Trademark Office. How can this be helpful? \n \nWe applied for the patents in the United States for many reasons. First, the prevalence of fibroids is 70 per cent among the black women, while its prevalence is about 30 per cent in white women. Annually, 200,000 hysterectomies are performed mainly due to fibroids in the US. It\u2019s a shame that such a huge number of hysterectomies are operated in a country with population of more than 300 million, so the US will be the foremost country needing our surgical instruments as the best alternative for hysterectomies. Second, the US patent office is a leading organization in protecting intellectual properties and all credible patent offices worldwide conduct overall searches in their database and refer to the US patent office issued patents. So applying for a patent in the US patent office will guarantee your rights to the invention almost internationally. \n \nA real problem regarding Iran\u2019s Intellectual Properties Office is that their documents and databases are published and issued in Persian which rules out the possibility that foreign countries could conduct patent searches in Iran\u2019s patent database; this would allow infringement of Iranians right to their inventions on international scale. It is not too late for other Iranian inventors to apply for patent in the US even if they had formerly applied for the Iranian patent. \n \nHave you managed to attract any sponsor so far? \n \nWe have started looking for a sponsor since November and currently we are negotiating with some sponsors, banks and government organizations to finance our research and commercialize our instruments. We hope for raising sufficient fund soon before the Patent Office in the US registers an overriding invention. We believe that women deserve this to restore their health and preserving their uterine. \n \nHow hard is it to apply for a patent in Iran? \n \nFortunately applying for a patent in Iran is a straightforward and coherent process. The process is accurate and almost fast. But the main challenge is the commercialization which is hurdled in administrative and bureaucratic maze. The project needs long-term scientific and financial aid. Investors often seek quick-impact projects. Instead of investing on a project which might come to fruition in years, they can invest on a quick-impact project or importing and exporting goods and gain much more profit easily and in a shorter amount of time without taking the risks of investing on a project which may or may not pay off. In general, start-ups is a good idea for commercialization, but if you conduct a search you will see the most successful start-ups are almost internet-based services rather than complicated or scientific projects such as ours. \n \nThere are some organization in the government such as President\u2019s office which offers financial support to inventors with marketing ideas. But there are still some shortcomings and setbacks regarding the process. Unnecessary bureaucracy to enter the system is pretty time-consuming. They refer the inventors to the banks to appeal for fund but the banks are either facing budget deficit or they might ask for some assets to pledge as collateral for the loan. Government may recognize the importance of the projects, but the banking system might dismiss the fact that how time is crucial for such projects.  China plays an important role in the world\u2019s production. They manufacture almost everything and offer them in cheap and competitive prices. This has led to influx of industries from the US and Europe to China, thus rising unemployment figures in the U.S as well as the European countries. Merchants and manufactures prefer purchasing the most affordable product rather than manufacturing domestic products at a higher costs. Obviously, they would balk at the idea of investing in new and radical ideas. \n \nIn general, how supporting inventions could help a country make progress? \n \nThe answer to this question has many aspects. The most apparent impact an invention or an entrepreneurial venture can exert upon a country is the economic boom. Entrepreneurs can create jobs for the people and fuel economic growth. Inventions can also promote social welfare. Countries are divided into main categories as developed and developing or underdeveloped. In the underdeveloped societies, even if they need advanced technologies, there is no place for innovation, because they have to go through a lot of hardship to obtain their primary needs for surviving such as clean water and health. When all of the primary requirements are satisfied, they will turn to their secondary needs which relates to lifestyle and luxuary. Developed country usually encourage and foster innovations. There is a direct relation between introducing advanced technologies and the cutting-edge scientific discoveries and higher reasonable expectations in developed countries. Naturally, someone who has experienced air travel cannot use the old and traditional transportation system. It is natural that they will tend for using even more advanced systems such as ultrasonic airplanes and more. \n \nWhat happens if you do not succeed in raising fund? \n \nWe have invented five surgical devices which need to be developed, tested, verified and certified by Ministry of Health. Completion of each phase might take about two years. We have showcased the inventions in many international exhibition; we reached out international companies and research centers to cooperate with us on the project. In the meantime there might be some people who adapt our idea without our confirmation or permission and start to develop it by adding or removing some features to or from our invention and make a totally different instrument which even we might fail to detect. The competition is fierce and we must be swift to take chances and leap at every opportunity to succeed. We named our group \u201cMechatronism\u201d (like a mechanism which includes electronic devices.) We are absolutely determined and working hard day and night to get to reasonable result.

The country\u2019s courts convict and imprison peaceful dissenters and have failed to hold officials accountable for torture and other serious rights violations. \n \nEdward Corrigan said Western countries are more concerned about their strategic alliance with the Al-Khalifa regime than about human rights or the wishes of the majority of the population in Bahrain. \n \nHe warned if the population of Bahrain explodes in anger over the repression and discriminatory treatment, it will put in jeopardy the presence of the United States and Britain, given their long history of support for the Al-Khalifa dictatorship. \n \n\u201cStrategic relationship with the Al-Khalifa regime is due to its strategic location of Bahrain which allows the United States and Britain to project their power in the Persian Gulf area,\u201d Corrigan noted in an exclusive interview with Mehr News Agency: \n \nWhat is the outcome of Bahraini government\u2019s suppression of pro-democracy activists? How do you evaluate the role of international community in countering the crimes and torture in Bahrain? \n \nThe brutal repression of peaceful marchers who are protesting the execution by firing squad of the three young activists is only going to intensify the resistance to the Al-Khalifa regime. If the regime does not allow peaceful protest and recognize the right to free speech and address the concerns of the majority Shia population there will be more violence. If one suppresses peaceful protest then it makes it inevitable that violent protest will result if there is no other alternative. \n \nIn September 2016 in a joint statement signed by 35 countries, the UN Human Rights Council expressed serious concern about human rights violations in Bahrain including imprisonment of those exercising their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association, and lack of accountability. \n \nIn response to the executions the international community has been more vocal in their criticism. The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner issued a harsh rebuke saying that it was appalled by the executions. The UN Commission said they had \u201cserious doubts whether the accused were provided with the right to have a fair trial.\u201d \n \nThe UN Committee was extremely critical of the trials and executions. In a Press Release they wrote: \u201cWe are appalled at the execution by firing squad of three men in Bahrain on Sunday. The men had been convicted of a bombing in Manama in 2014 that killed three police officers. They were found guilty after being allegedly tortured into making false confessions and their lawyers were not given access to all the evidence against them nor allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses during court hearings.\u201d \n \nThey were joined by the United States who said they were \u201cconcerned\u201d about the executions. France also condemned the executions. Great Britain and the European Union deplored the use of the death penalty in this situation. Many other countries including Iran, and Iraq strongly condemned the executions of what they called \u201cpolitical\u201d prisoners. \n \nHere is what Human Rights Watch wrote about the trials: \u201cThe UN Human Rights Committee, which interprets the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Bahrain has ratified, has said that \u201cin cases of trials leading to the imposition of the death penalty scrupulous respect of the guarantees of fair trial is particularly important and that any death penalty imposed after an unfair trial would be a violation of the right to life. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.\u201d \n \nAmnesty International has made similar criticism of the trials and called them \u201cunfair\u201d and they noted that the confessions were based on torture. The trials did not meet the required international standards. \n \nHow do you analyze the role of other countries, including US and UK, in raising tensions in Bahrain resulting in human rights abuses? \n \nThe muted protests of the United States, Great Britain and other Western powers is appalling. They are more concerned about their strategic alliance with the Al-Khalifa regime than about human rights or the wishes of the majority of the population in Bahrain. Britain has a military presence in Bahrain which they wish to protect. The United States 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain. The Americans also provide other support. In June 2016, the US government lifted its embargo on arms sales to the Bahrain National Guard and Bahrain Defense Forces. In August 2016 approved an US$150 million deal to supply military aircraft parts, ammunition and communications equipment to Bahrain. These actions reward the Manama regime for its violation of human and political rights. \n \nIf the population of Bahrain explodes in anger over the repression and discriminatory treatment, it will put in jeopardy the presence of the United States and Britain, given their long history of support for the Al-Khalifa dictatorship. \n \nWhy human rights pretenders like the US and UK not only are silent against Bahraini government curtailing freedoms of expression, association and assembly and cracking down on dissent, but also provide the country with financial aids? \n \nAgain it is the perceived \u201cstrategic relationship\u201d with the Al-Khalifa regime and the strategic location of Bahrain which allows the United States and Britain to project their power in the Persian Gulf area that dominates the thinking of the Western Powers. The importance of oil and the ongoing support of the British, and now the Americans, for the monarchical dictatorships in the Persian Gulf region necessitates a military presence to prop up the autocratic feudal regimes in the area. There is a realization on the part of the West that if they did not support the Persian Gulf States with weapons, money and military force if needed, these regimes would collapse given their precarious nature. \n \nDo you think the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF)- a financial pool worth more than £1bn a year- is evidence of the militarization of Britain\u2019s development budget and UK complicity in abuses? \n \nYes. This budget is largely without oversight and is controlled by the Conservative British government at the present time. There has been funding to Bahrain in the amount of two million pounds. It does appear that this fund is being used to support dictatorships and not development. \n \nMany activists, NGOs and Human rights campaigners in Bahrain, like the Labor party in Britain, complain about the lack of transparency surrounding how the reserves are spent and about a high degree of ambiguity about the status of the CSSF fund. What do you think about this? \n \nThis money is reportedly to help Bahrain to improve its justice system and to improve human rights in the tiny Persian Gulf monarchy. However, as critics have pointed out that the justice system in Bahrain is getting much worse. Torture is being used against prisoners and being used to convict activists with some receiving the death sentence. In addition there is violent suppression of peaceful demonstrators, the killing of unarmed demonstrators and the revocation of citizenship from more than 200 Bahrainis. Freedom of speech and political rights are under severe attack in Bahrain. There have been calls in Britain by the Labor Opposition and by human rights groups to stop sending money to Bahrain until the Al-Khalifa regime substantially improves its human rights record. This money should be used to improve human rights and not to reward human rights abusers. \n \nEdward C.

Leicester took the lead with a comical own goal from Darren Bent after eight minutes, with the former England striker slicing horribly into his own net, but the wheels swiftly came off.\n\nBent gained redemption with a brilliant header to level and Craig Bryson finished smartly to put the visitors under the cosh five minutes before halftime.\n\nClaudio Ranieri's side rallied after the break, yet had to wait until the 86th minute for Morgan to draw them level, with the captain rising to head substitute Demarai Gray's corner powerfully into the net.\n\nFans did not have to wait long for the tie to spring into life although it did so in hilarious fashion with a moment that is likely to be repeated for years to come in compilations of footballing bloopers.\n\nBent, the former Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa striker, was defending the post from a corner when the ball fell into his path.\n\nHe had an age to clear his lines but instead swung horribly and sliced it into his own net, gazing dumbstruck as the visiting fans roared in a combination of celebration and laughter. He made amends in style 13 minutes later, however, with a pinpoint header from Will Hughes's cross that skidded off the wet turf and away from the despairing dive of Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nIt was another example of how Leicester's defence, which conceded just 36 league goals last season and was the cornerstone of their title success, has become a glaring weakness this time around.\n\nHaving already conceded 37 goals in 22 league games this season, Leicester's back four is now their Achilles heel and it was breached far too easily for the second time by Derby before halftime.\n\nBryson picked the ball up 25 metres from goal and burst into the area unchallenged before planting his finish past Schmeichel.\n\nLeicester, however, are also struggling to find the net and two glorious opportunities went begging at the start of the second half with both falling to Gray.\n\nHe hammered the first into the midriff of derby keeper Scott Carson when he seemed certain to score and then hit the base of the post when played into space, with Shinji Okazaki failing to convert either of two follow-up efforts.\n\nMorgan ensured Leicester's blushes were spared, however, and their home form, which is a vast improvement on their away record this season, means they will be favourites for the replay.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Leicester City news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Morgan rescues Leicester in FA Cup draw","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/sport/2017/01/28/captain-morgan-rescues-leicester-in-fa-cup-draw-with-derby&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695195546613","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/28/leicester-1.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Leicester-1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Actually, following the predictions of Nostradamus, one assumedly major nuclear confrontation will possibly happen in the area in which the aggressor is the one breaking the promise of not using the nuclear weapons or its violent power in any warfare. The sad tidings here would be how the naval fleets would go kept by other powers, and then they could get scattered due to the violence of the powerful blast.\n\nDuring the course of 2014 to present day 2015 we have seen a huge up-tick in global military action, in some countries we have even seen military personnel on the streets and in the homes and businesses of the people who they are paid to protect. We have seen global governments pushing and prodding each other into position of war via proxy wars, economic wars, as the war on humanity is what takes centre stage Enchanted LifePath Alternate Media Reports takes a closer look at exactly what countries are invoked in military procedures at home or abroad throughout the world.\n\nLETS LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE IN MORE DETAIL\n\nWith the world inching closer to war, many historians, Biblical scholars and fans of Nostradamus are pointing to the current Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran. Global alliances could quickly turn a 2-nation war into a regional war, and then into a world war. How would the US fair and who would be on our side? We divided the world based on current alliances to see how the two sides match up and who has the edge.\n\nThe following battle lines were researched and chosen exclusively by Whiteout Press. We used a number of criteria to make our decision for each nation. Among the items we considered were; current military alliances, religious affiliations, historical alliances, ethnic ties, trade relations and statements by national leaders right out of today\u2019s headlines.\n\nJudaism vs. Islam, Christian civil war\n\nAs the world map is laid out, one of the trends we immediately notice is that the former Soviet nations and their Eastern Orthodox Christian faith will follow-up on their current promise and come to the aid of their Islamic allies in any war against the United States. With the Soviets come the global Communists, including some right in America\u2019s backyard.\n\nThe Neutrals\n\nIt is inevitable that many nations will attempt to remain neutral. But in the global world we live in, there is no such thing as neutrality. Nations that can\u2019t fight for or buy their neutrality, like India and Switzerland, will simply be used like pawns in a chess game by the world\u2019s superpowers. We did take history into account and countries like Nepal, Nigeria and Sweden who have always fought for and won their neutrality during regional wars are labeled as neutral again here.\n\nOther neutral countries are marked that way for a different reason. Some countries around the globe are so devastated and disoriented by current civil wars, they have no functioning government able to take any side. Some might conclude that a few of these civil wars are the first wave of the possible coming World War 3. In many instances, the wars are between militant Christians and Islamic Jihadists.\n\nThe numbers and statistics\n\nWe\u2019ve left out nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as chemical and biological weapons. Nations don\u2019t typically disclose their actual arsenal and half the nuclear-armed countries still don\u2019t acknowledge they have the weapons of mass destruction. Another reason to leave them off the list is pure wishful thinking. For if World War 3 is in fact a nuclear war instead of a conventional war, there will be nobody left to read these words anyway.\n\nIn the cases of some small nations without any military or published information, we had to make our best guess. Most all statistics however come from each respective nation\u2019s published data or one of the following sources","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Enchanted LifePath"},"topics":[{"name":"Syria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"WW3 - The World At War - A Full List Of Countries Involved In Syrian Conflict Plus Other Boiling Points Of 2015","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Before It's News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"557901141","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"326"},"name":"Before It's News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://beforeitsnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/"],"sequenceId":"695195547785","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://enchantedlifepath.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/efe1-300x188.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It is enough, I am calm, I behaved on the bench so no more words,\" added the Portuguese, who has been given two touchline bans this season.\n\nHull faced a daunting prospect to drag themselves back into the tie and made seven changes to their starting lineup in a sign that manager Marco Silva had perhaps already decided a Wembley final was beyond them.\n\nThe encounter had the feel of a foregone conclusion too as both sets of players seemed to be going through the motions in a dour opening when neither side created a chance before the deadlock was broken after 35 minutes following a penalty decision that caused initial confusion.\n\nReplays showed that United defender Marcos Rojo had barely tugged the shirt of Hull's Harry Maguire, who tumbled to the ground before Huddlestone rifled the spot kick into the bottom corner.\n\nIt was not until the second half that United showed true signs of life and they had their own penalty appeal waved away when Chris Smalling tumbled to the ground after contact with Huddlestone, sparking an angry touchline reaction from Mourinho.\n\nHis mood mellowed, however, with 25 minutes remaining when Pogba pounced on a misplaced ball from Huddlestone in his own area to stab United level on the night and restore their two-goal aggregate cushion.\n\nRojo and Niasse rattled the crossbar with headers at either end before the latter set up a nervy finale for United, who will bid for a fifth League Cup triumph and first since 2010 when they face Southampton next month.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester United news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"United edge Hull to reach League Cup final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/sport/2017/01/27/united-edge-past-spirited-hull-to-reach-league-cup-final&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695195549908","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/27/united-1.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/United-1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Reuters News"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Town Hall","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668418","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"778"},"name":"Town Hall","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.townhall.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195550084","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Goals by Richard Stearman and Andreas Weimann proved enough for Wolves, 18th in the second tier, to inflict a third home defeat in a week on Juergen Klopp's faltering side who managed only one win in eight matches in January.\n\nFourth-tier Wycombe Wanderers, 70 places below Tottenham in the English pyramid, were minutes away from trumping Wolves with a genuine giantkilling away win over Premier League title hopefuls Tottenham Hotspur but lost a thriller 4-3.\n\nTwo goals by Paul Hayes, one a penalty, gave Wycombe a 2-0 halftime lead at White Hart Lane and Garry Thompson sent the away fans crazy by restoring their lead seven minutes from time after Tottenham had fought back.\n\nTottenham were reduced to 10 men when Kieran Trippier limped off after the hosts had used all their substitutes but Dele Alli coolly equalised in the 89th minute before Son Heung-min struck seven minutes into stoppage time with his second goal of the game.\n\n\"This is the beauty of the FA Cup. It's magic. This is completely different to Spain or France,\" relieved Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino said after his side's ninth consecutive home victory in all competitions.\n\nLincoln City, one of two survivors from outside the Football League, continued their dream run with a 3-1 home victory against Championship leaders Brighton & Hove Albion to reach the fifth round for the first time in the modern era. They also got that far in 1887 when the competition involved far fewer clubs at the outset.\n\nRafael Benitez's Newcastle United, Brighton's close rivals for promotion to the top flight, also slipped up to lower-level opponents, outplayed 3-0 at League One's Oxford United.\n\nArsenal made light of a touchline ban for manager Arsene Wenger as Theo Walcott scored a hat-trick and Danny Welbeck struck twice in a 5-0 hammering of League Cup finalists Southampton at St Mary's while in the day's other all-Premier League duel Manchester City outclassed Crystal Palace 3-0 at Selhurst Park.\n\nChelsea breeze\n\nPremier League leaders Chelsea breezed past second-tier Brentford 4-0, Middlesbrough beat Accrington Stanley 1-0 and Burnley saw off Bristol City 2-0.\n\nBlackburn Rovers won a north-west derby 2-0 against Blackpool in a game memorable for protests against their clubs' respective owners by both sets of fans. Huddersfield reached the fifth round with a 4-0 thrashing of Rochdale.\n\nLiverpool, already reeling from last weekend's home defeat by Swansea City which left them 10 points adrift in the Premier League title race and Wednesday's League Cup semi-final defeat by Southampton, made a dreadful start on Saturday. Wolves were ahead after 53 seconds as an unmarked Stearman headed in Helder Costa's free kick and Weimann made it 2-0 five minutes before halftime after more good work by Costa.\n\nDivock Origi scored late on but it was too little too late.\n\n\"I could look for excuses but I don't want to, maybe we should use this time to be disappointed, to be frustrated, to be angry at ourselves,\" Klopp said. \"All I can say. Sorry.\"\n\nNational League leaders Lincoln, who knocked out Championship side Ipswich Town in round three, sent the Sincil Bank crowd crazy as they outplayed a below-strength Brighton side.\n\nRichie Towell gave Brighton, 72 places higher than Lincoln, the lead but the hosts equalised through Alan Power's penalty and took the lead when Fikayo Tomori scored an own goal. Theo Robinson rounded off the win.\n\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte made nine changes but his side were cruising after 21 minutes with goals from Pedro and Willian. Branislav Ivanovic and Michy Batshuayi also scored.\n\nHolders Manchester United play Wigan Athletic on Sunday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester City news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: EPL - Arsenal news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Arsenal, Chelsea cruise in FA Cup","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/sport/2017/01/29/wolves-leave-liverpool-reeling-after-cup-shock-spurs-scrape-through&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695195550394","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/29/1-theo-walcott-celebrates-scoring-their-third-goal-with-team-mates.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/1+Theo+Walcott+celebrates+scoring+their+third+goal+with+team+mates.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council.
